What makes an individual worthy of a spot on the Kenyans.co.ke Top 100 Kenyans?", "articleBody": "Over the last one year, Kenya has experienced a paradigm shift in almost all sectors following the unexpected disruption caused by the Covid-19 pandemic that swept across the world.\n\nDespite this disruption of the economy and normal way of life, the Kenyan spirit of resilience was visible by act and design through inventions, innovations, causes, leadership and research among others.\n\nMany Kenyans, in their different disciplines and career paths, directly or indirectly made impact through their acts of courage, thought process and leadership.\n\nKenyans.co.ke, through its pool of experienced editors and journalists, combed through the performance, impact and influence of Kenyans from across all sectors to compile and consolidate this list of Top 100 Kenyans 2021.\n\nThis is a collection of the most influential people across the country, and the names on the list include entertainers, political leaders, industrialists, investors, media personalities, entrepreneurs, sportspersons and community workers among others.\n\nSo what makes people influential? What makes an individual worthy of a spot on the Kenyans.co.ke Top 100 Kenyans 2021?\n\nThe people with the greatest impact in their careers and line of duty in the year under review deserve to be ranked highly. Each of these incredible and inspirational people used the power of their minds, innovations and position to make a change in the country.\n\nAll entrants in the Top 100 Kenyans 2021 have challenged the status quo in one way or the other over the past 12 months.\n\nA diverse crew, to say the least, Top 100 Kenyans 2021 perfectly encapsulates the unique collection of thought-starters and industry leaders that invariably shape the country and the list itself.\n\nThis list features extraordinary leaders in the country working to build a better future; from entertainers striving to make Kenyan content more inclusive to activists advocating for respect of human rights and upholding the rule of law. They are disruptors, iconoclasts, doers, problem-solvers, fixers\u2014people who in a year of crisis have made a visible mark.\n\n43 of the entrants this year are female, with the youngest featured, Shanah Manjeru, just 13-years-old. Conversely, Manu Chandaria - a renowned industrialist and philanthropist, takes home the unenviable honour of being the oldest person in the list at 92 years of age.\n\nIn the dispensation of their mandates on a daily basis, the listed Top 100 Kenyans 2021 went over and above board to easily navigate ethical challenges such as conflicts of interest, junkets, intellectual theft, kowtowing to parties of interest, freebies, use of dubious ways and means to get things done, and outright bending of the law.\n\nWhile compiling this list, Kenyans.co.ke ensured that the persons nominated and eventually voted in, were free from governmental, commercial and proprietorial interference in their respective disciplines.\n\nFrom their relationships with people in related field to those outside their careers, all the entrants of the Top 100 Kenyans 2021 have succeeded in commanding total control of their work. Invariably, these individuals have been men and women of great wealth and talent.\n\nDuring the entire nomination process, several questions were answered. These included; How do these nominees ensure that they make decisions that positively impact on the citizens? How do they go about making sure what they do is within the precinct of the law?

In the process, most buyers encounter a dditional charges other than the price of a house or land.\n\nThese additional charges are known as transaction costs. Most of these transaction fees occur while purchasing a property while others are fixed depending on the location of the land, type of documents required, and commission fees charged by professionals who are overseeing the whole transaction.\n\nThe transaction fees in most cases amounts to almost 10-15 per cent of the cost of acquiring the property but to naive buyers, they end up paying more if not well advised.\n\nHere are some of the additional charges that are associated with acquiring property.\n\nFile\n\nPlot Viewing Fee\n\nMost real estate professionals warn individuals against paying the viewing fee before setting their eyes on the property. But before one agrees to purchase land, viewing is part of the process which involves getting the exact measurements and getting to know more about the location.\n\nIn most cases, a buyer is charged up to Ksh2,000 non-refundable depending on the real estate agent overseeing the sale of the property.\n\n\"A majority of the real estate, ours too, do not charge but only oversee all the aforementioned charges which are normal and procedural in land dealings.\n\n\"The charge familiar with real estate agencies is the land or plot viewing fee, charged when you express interest to go and view a plot of land before purchasing. Some companies charge Ksh500 or Ksh1,000 which is non-refundable. Some like us and others offer free site visit,\" Moses Muriithi, CEO at Fanaka Real Estate told Kenyans.co.ke.\n\nLawyer Fees\n\nFor any land or property transaction to take place, a lawyer must be present to witness the deal. Their presence in that process attracts some legal fees which the buyer is expected to pay.\n\nIn Kenya, the Advocates Remuneration Act states that the minimum amount to be paid to any lawyer undertaking such a process is Ksh35,000.\n\nThis fee varies with law firms and the value of the property being purchased. A lawyer's role in the process involves conducting due diligence on the land before and after the transaction.\n\nThe lawyer's role is also instrumental after the commissioner's office gives the buyer approval and transfer papers are supposed to be prepared.\n\n\"The lawyer's fee is guided by the law. One cannot overcharge or charge below the stipulated amount. The figure stands at Ksh35,000 but it varies depending on the value of the property,\" Lawyer Ken Mugambi told Kenyans.co.ke.\n\n\"This enables a legal practitioner to do all the due diligence to ensure that a client buys the right property and gets all the required documents.\"\n\nSearch fee\n\nFor one to establish that the land is legit and is registered under the real owner, a property search has to be carried out. This includes previous legal fees linked with the land.\n\nThrough the online platform, eCitizen, the property search is usually Ksh500. Before this process, a buyer usually meets with the Land Control Board (LCB). These meetings require a facilitation fee of Ksh1000.\n\nAlternatively, a land buyer can book another meeting with a Special Land Control Board that is made up of the Assistant County Commissioner and the two transaction parties. The facilitation for these meetings cost Ksh5000.\n\nStamp Duty\n\nAfter the transaction is completely done, a duty fee is levied on all the transactions. The amount levied at this stage varies depending on different locations and the price of the property.\n\nIn areas around Nairobi, Mombasa, Nakuru, Kisumu, Eldoret, and other urban areas, 4 per cent is levied for land and property while those in rural areas are levied a fee of 2 per cent on the value of the acquired property.\n\nOther than stamp duty, there is also capital gains tax which is required to be paid strictly through the iTax system. This is usually charged at 5 per cent of the net gain value.\n\nRegistration Fee\n\nThis fee is paid to the land Registry for purposes of making entry into the registry and title printing costs. This is roughly around Ksh500 to Ksh1,000.\n\nTransfer of Consent\n\nThis is usually written permission of the relevant authority, the property owner or any other interested party that okays the transaction of property which is mandatory according to land and property laws.\n\nConsents vary depending on the tenure of the land. The consent include, Land Control Board Consent or Consent to Transfer from the Lessor.\n\nA fee of Ksh1000 is applicable to transfer from the commissioner of lands that is paid by the land buyer.\n\nValuation Fee\n\nThis is the process of analysing the property to determine its market value. This is essential as it is used to inform the calculating taxes, sale value, or even leasing value.\n\nPlots within the municipal council administrative unit charge Ksh1,000 while those in urban centers, in this case, Nairobi, charge Ksh500. However, some real estate agents pay this cost for their clients.\n\nUtility Fees\n\nIn areas around the city, most buyers are required to dig deep into their pockets to pay some utility fees such as water, electricity, and garbage collection. In other developed residential areas, buyers are required to pay for security, road maintenance among others.\n\n\"In some areas, like here in Katani, Machakos county, one is expected to pay security fees and even for road maintenance.

In this case, one is required to pay some additional fees to the lenders. When paying back, they pay with interest.

Notably, a group of dishonest exploiters is also excited about the shopping season.\n\nWhether you are the kind of shopper that saved up money or one who is just shopping on impulse, cheaters will not think twice about taking advantage of naive shoppers.\n\nKenyans.co.ke identified the following as mistakes that cost Kenyans their hard-earned money when shopping online:\n\n1. Not doing proper research\n\nMost Kenyans do not do due diligence when it comes to researching their products. Research helps potential buyers know what they want to purchase.\n\nHaving information on a product at one's fingertips helps the buyer distinguish a legit product from a counterfeit at face value. It also protects the buyer from the second kind of mistake \u2013 overpricing, hence saving money in the process.\n2. Buy from an invalidated shop/ store/dealer\n\nAlthough one may argue that it is difficult to make out the legitimacy of a shop or dealer, most online shopping sites have made this simpler. Some websites offer a legitimacy tag which is often attached to a product.\n\nThese are mostly in the form of icons reading 'verified', 'approved' or 'authorized'. In addition, one can verify the authenticity of the shop or dealer by looking at the number of people who have bought from them. The more the clients, the more trusted the dealer.\n\n3. Pre-Paying\n\nA section of sellers give shoppers the option of paying before, but the majority are leaning towards the pay-on-delivery. After all, the business is anchored on trust. However, shoppers are advised to always go for the pay-after option.\n\nSeveral people have complained about not receiving products they paid for. In the event where one is asked to pay before, for instance, when making a pre-order, be sure to verify the dealer as stated above.\n\n4. Not checking for any extra costs\n\nWhile shipping costs within the country are manageable, shoppers who buy products abroad may have to part with more money. This is where the conning games begin.\n\nCunning sellers attach a ridiculously high shipping rate, and to get the better of shoppers they put the cost in foreign currency denominations. As a result, one ends up paying much more than the fair value of the product.\n\nOnline shoppers are also advised to take note of tax tags. While some sellers include, the tax in prices displayed on the sites, others omit it to make their products appear cheaper.\n\nThe buyer is then greeted with shock when they are asked to part with more money by the taxman when they go to collect the item.\n\n5. Failure to keep your debit or credit card details private\n\nMost Kenyans are accustomed to shopping with their bank cards. Shoppers are advised to be wary of infiltrators who tap data from the sites and use it to access your card.\n\nTo stop this, always check that the site you are using is secure. In addition, go through the privacy policy of the site to know how it will protect your data.\n\nIn as much as banks have tried to solve this by sending an approval message before a purchase, securing your money begins with you.\n\n6. Looking past previews and reviews\n\nWhile previews of the product give buyers an snippet on the product by the company selling it, reviews serve as testimonials from people who have actually used the product. Always create time to go through most if not all reviews to get an accurate depiction of the product.\n\n7. Tagged photos and refund policies\n\nTo ensure that what you see is what you get, always ask the owner of the product to send you a tagged photo.

Notably, a group of dishonest exploiters is also excited about the shopping season.</p><p>Whether you are the kind of shopper that saved up money or one who is just shopping on impulse, cheaters will not think twice about <a href=\"https://www.kenyans.co.ke/node/33470\">taking advantage of naive shoppers</a>.</p><p><em><a href=\"https://www.kenyans.co.ke/node/65982\">Kenyans.co.ke</a></em> identified the following as mistakes that cost Kenyans their hard-earned money when shopping online:\u00a0</p> <figure><img src=\"https://www.kenyans.co.ke/files/styles/article_inner_mobile/public/images/media/Untitled%20design%20-%202021-11-10T165309.883.jpg?itok=qQKQ2GEe\" alt=\"xas ha \"><figcaption>An Image of a customer keying in credit card details<br><br>Poike</figcaption></figure> <p><strong>1. Not doing proper research</strong></p><p>Most Kenyans do not do due diligence when it comes to researching their products. Research helps potential buyers know what they want to purchase.</p><p>Having information on a product at one's fingertips helps the buyer distinguish a legit product from a counterfeit at face value. It also protects the buyer from the second kind of mistake \u2013 overpricing, hence saving money in the process.<br>\u00a0<br><strong>2. Buy from an invalidated shop/ store/dealer</strong></p><p>Although one may argue that it is difficult to <a href=\"https://www.kenyans.co.ke/node/41252\">make out the legitimacy of a shop or dealer</a>, most online shopping sites have made this simpler. Some websites offer a legitimacy tag which is often attached to a product.</p><p>These are mostly in the form of icons reading 'verified', 'approved' or 'authorized'. In addition, one can verify the authenticity of the shop or dealer by looking at the number of people who have bought from them. The more the clients, the more trusted the dealer.</p><p><strong>3. Pre-Paying</strong></p><p>A section of sellers give shoppers the option of paying before, but the majority are leaning towards the pay-on-delivery. After all, the business is anchored on trust. However, shoppers are advised to always go for the pay-after option.</p><p>Several people have complained about not receiving products they paid for. In the event where one is asked to pay before, for instance, when making a pre-order, be sure to verify the dealer as stated above.</p><p><strong>4. Not checking for any extra costs</strong></p><p>While shipping costs within the country are manageable, shoppers who buy products abroad may have to part with more money. This is where the conning games begin.</p><p>Cunning sellers <a href=\"https://www.kenyans.co.ke/node/42251\">attach a ridiculously high shipping rate</a>, and to get the better of shoppers they put the cost in foreign currency denominations. As a result, one ends up paying much more than the fair value of the product.\u00a0</p><p>Online shoppers are also advised to take note of tax tags. While some sellers include, the tax in prices displayed on the sites, others omit it to make their products appear cheaper.</p><p>The buyer is then greeted with shock when they are asked to part with more money by the taxman when they go to collect the item.</p><p><strong>5. Failure to keep your debit or credit card details private</strong></p><p>Most Kenyans are accustomed to shopping with their bank cards. Shoppers are advised to be wary of infiltrators who tap data from the sites and use it to access your card.</p><p>To stop this, always check that the site you are using is secure. In addition, go through the privacy policy of the site to know how it will protect your data.</p><p>In as much as banks have tried to solve this by sending an approval message before a purchase, <a href=\"https://www.kenyans.co.ke/node/66093\">securing your money begins with you.</a></p><p><strong>6. Looking past previews and reviews</strong></p><p>While previews of the product give buyers an snippet on the product by the company selling it, reviews serve as testimonials from people who have actually used the product. Always create time to go through most if not all reviews to get an accurate depiction of the product.</p><p><strong>7. Tagged photos and refund policies</strong></p><p>To ensure that what you see is what you get, always ask the owner of the product to send you a tagged photo. This is a photo of the product taken by the seller with a tag written your name on it to show a real-time depiction.</p><p>Buyers should also look out for the refund policies. This informs them on the number of days they have to return any product they are dissatisfied with to avoid double loss.</p> <figure><img src=\"https://www.kenyans.co.ke/files/styles/article_inner_mobile/public/images/media/shopping%20.jpg?itok=izjDPt12\" alt=\"A stock image of a supermarket attendant\"><figcaption>A stock image of a supermarket attendant</figcaption></figure>File </li></ul>\n\n</article>", "canonicalUrl": "https://www.kenyans.co.ke/news/70413-costly-mistakes-avoid-when-shopping-online"},{"url": "https://www.kenyans.co.ke/news/72094-raila-why-i-cut-birthday-cake-exactly-1147-am", "probability": 0.98323786, "headline": "Raila: Why I Cut My Symbolic Birthday Cake at Exactly 11:47am", "datePublished": "2022-01-07T15:10:52+03:00", "datePublishedRaw": "2022-01-07T15:10:52+0300", "dateModified": "2022-01-07T15:19:34+03:00", "dateModifiedRaw": "2022-01-07T15:19:34+0300", "author": "Geoffrey Lutta", "authorsList": ["Geoffrey Lutta"], "inLanguage": "en", "mainImage": "https://www.kenyans.co.ke/files/styles/article_style/public/images/media/Raila%20Birthday%20cake.jpg?itok=Fi6_NdLS", "images": ["https://www.kenyans.co.ke/files/styles/article_inner_mobile/public/images/media/Raila%20Dance.jpg?itok=jbLwWdyy", "https://www.kenyans.co.ke/files/styles/article_inner_mobile/public/images/media/Raila%20arriving.jpg?itok=RhZu-wMZ"], "description": "Raila Odinga came out to reveal why his birthday cake was cut at exactly 11:47 am during his celebration at Bomas of Kenya, Nairobi.", "articleBody": "The Orange Democratic Movement (ODM) leader, Raila Odinga, celebrated his 77th birthday in a special way and revealed some unknown facts about his childhood.\n\nSpeaking at the Bomas of Kenya, Nairobi on Friday, January 7, where the birthday celebrations were being held, the former Prime Minister explained to the crowd that graced his event why he chose to cut his birthday cake at exactly 11:47am.\n\nRaila explained that 11:47am signifies the exact time he was born.
