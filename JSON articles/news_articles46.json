The oath of allegiance they took as part of their graduation is a testament to the sanctity of their duty to serve,\u201d noted the NPS.</p>\n\n<figure><img data-attachment-id=\"11314\" data-permalink=\"https://viraltea.co.ke/gsu-graduates-in-viral-video-will-remain-at-training-centre/264271487_2998800867036111_4635669569137309422_n/\" data-orig-file=\"https://i0.wp.com/viraltea.co.ke/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/264271487_2998800867036111_4635669569137309422_n.jpg?fit=2048%2C1152&amp;ssl=1\" data-orig-size=\"2048,1152\" data-comments-opened=\"1\" data-image-meta=\"{&quot;aperture&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;credit&quot;:&quot;Samuel Miring'u&quot;,&quot;camera&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;caption&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;created_timestamp&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;copyright&quot;:&quot;PSCU 2018&quot;,&quot;focal_length&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;iso&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;shutter_speed&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;title&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;orientation&quot;:&quot;0&quot;}\" data-image-title=\"264271487_2998800867036111_4635669569137309422_n\" data-image-description=\"&lt;p&gt;President Uhuru Kenyatta inspects the passing-out parade of 2,502 General Service Unit (GSU) recruits at their Embakasi B Campus in Nairobi County. /PSCU&lt;/p&gt;\n\" data-image-caption=\"&lt;p&gt;President Uhuru Kenyatta inspects the passing-out parade of 2,502 General Service Unit (GSU) recruits at their Embakasi B Campus in Nairobi County. /PSCU&lt;/p&gt;\n\" data-medium-file=\"https://i0.wp.com/viraltea.co.ke/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/264271487_2998800867036111_4635669569137309422_n.jpg?fit=300%2C169&amp;ssl=1\" data-large-file=\"https://i0.wp.com/viraltea.co.ke/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/264271487_2998800867036111_4635669569137309422_n.jpg?fit=1024%2C576&amp;ssl=1\" src=\"https://i0.wp.com/viraltea.co.ke/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/264271487_2998800867036111_4635669569137309422_n.jpg?resize=1024%2C576&amp;ssl=1\" alt=\"\" srcset=\"https://i0.wp.com/viraltea.co.ke/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/264271487_2998800867036111_4635669569137309422_n.jpg?resize=1024%2C576&amp;ssl=1 1024w, https://i0.wp.com/viraltea.co.ke/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/264271487_2998800867036111_4635669569137309422_n.jpg?resize=300%2C169&amp;ssl=1 300w, https://i0.wp.com/viraltea.co.ke/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/264271487_2998800867036111_4635669569137309422_n.jpg?resize=768%2C432&amp;ssl=1 768w, https://i0.wp.com/viraltea.co.ke/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/264271487_2998800867036111_4635669569137309422_n.jpg?resize=1536%2C864&amp;ssl=1 1536w, https://i0.wp.com/viraltea.co.ke/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/264271487_2998800867036111_4635669569137309422_n.jpg?w=2048&amp;ssl=1 2048w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\"></figure>\n\n<p><br></p>\n\n</article>", "canonicalUrl": "https://viraltea.co.ke/gsu-graduates-in-viral-video-will-remain-at-training-centre/"},{"url": "https://viraltea.co.ke/uhuru-gives-cbk-new-powers-over-digital-loan-apps/", "probability": 0.99419504, "headline": "Uhuru Gives CBK New Powers Over Digital Loan Apps", "datePublished": "2021-12-07T12:38:05+03:00", "datePublishedRaw": "2021-12-07T12:38:05+03:00", "dateModified": "2021-12-07T12:40:31+03:00", "dateModifiedRaw": "2021-12-07T12:40:31+03:00", "author": "By Viral Tea Ke", "authorsList": ["By Viral Tea Ke"], "inLanguage": "en", "breadcrumbs": [{"name": "Home", "link": "https://viraltea.co.ke/"}, {"name": "Uhuru Gives CBK New Powers Over Digital Loan Apps", "link": "https://viraltea.co.ke/uhuru-gives-cbk-new-powers-over-digital-loan-apps/"}], "mainImage": "https://viraltea.co.ke/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/263806523_5283311091684372_2166754707796718453_n.jpg", "images": ["https://i0.wp.com/viraltea.co.ke/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/puxgnarobyvqr7p5c0cb4fbd6a37.png?resize=805%2C535&ssl=1", "https://i0.wp.com/viraltea.co.ke/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/264729675_5283314171684064_7718710248799270428_n.jpg?resize=1024%2C676&ssl=1", "https://i1.wp.com/viraltea.co.ke/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/728-x-90.png?w=1170&ssl=1"], "description": "(13) Digital loan apps in Kenya have a period of six months to register with the Central Bank of Kenya (CBK) according to an amendment bill signed by President Uhuru Kenyatta.

to the Neo Kenya Mpya bus accident on Tuesday, December 14 in Makuyu, Murang\u2019a County.\n\nReports by NTV indicated that the accident involved two buses that had ferried the students of Gititu Mixed High School after they closed on Monday, December 13.\n\nThe report went on to state that the bus was being driven by a conductor who was not authorised, nor was he qualified to do so.\n\nEyewitnesses revealed to the media outlet that the two buses were speeding and were closely following each other. The accident occurred when the second bus had tailgated the lead bus that eventually overturned.\n\n\u201cAs the bus approached a sharp corner, the driver attempted to slow down to enable him to negotiate the bend.

However, just living in a house is not enough, you need to feel comfortable when you step into your home every evening.\n\nWith all the distractions that fill our daily life, from TV, social media, work and everything in between, it can be hard to find your calm space, what is called your zen. The first step is to have a space to come back to at the end of the day that inspires a sense of calm within you.\n\nViral Tea spoke to Aisha Pandor, CEO of SweepSouth, for some advice on how to easily create a space that is calm, zen and a peaceful retreat for the whole family. She shared the following tips:\n\nDo a big purge\n\nGo through everything that you own and do a big purge of all the things you don\u2019t need. This includes furniture and big items, too.\n\nHave a TV that\u2019s been standing in your house unused? Get rid of it. Have an overabundance of clothes that you don\u2019t wear? Get rid of some. Doing a big purge of things you barely use will already make your home feel more spacious and less cluttered.\n\nChoose your colours wisely\n\nNeutral and natural colours work best for a zen space. Think earthy tones such as grey, white and beige.\n\nYou could also add in touches of natural green with plants to add a more nature-like feel to the space. Keep a natural colour palette in mind when you decorate.\n\nEven your furniture should have earthy colours. Your furniture should also ideally be made from natural materials and have clean, clear lines.\n\nLight candles or use air purifiers to add some organic scents to your space. Choose forestry, sea breeze or other natural scents for the full effect.\n\nUse a linen spray on your bedding or essential oils for added fragrances. It can add a calming effect to your room and make any space feel fresh and clean.\n\nMinimise electronic disturbances\n\nElectronic disturbances are very bad for zen. You don\u2019t have to get rid of all your electronics, but perhaps designate one room as a tech-free zone.\n\nHave an area where you have no TV or electronic device disturbances. But if you can\u2019t and there\u2019s a TV in the bedroom, put it in a place where you can shut it away \u2013 perhaps in a cabinet or cupboard.\n\nUse natural light\n\nIt\u2019s understandable that not every home has a lot of natural light, but where you can, use it as much as possible. Open curtains as early in the morning as possible and let in sunlight.\n\nAlso, use light fabric for your curtains so that your room isn\u2019t too dark and moody. If you need dark curtains in your bedroom for a good night\u2019s rest, then, of course, this won\u2019t work in that room for you. Perhaps your \u201czen room\u201d is then the living room or another room in your home.\n\nKeep clutter to a minimum\n\nClutter can be very distracting when you are trying to create a more zen environment. Pack clutter away where you can see it or use storage solutions to pack it all neatly. Get rid of what you can, clearing away anything you don\u2019t need in your zen space.\n\nAs Rumi says: \u201cLife is a balance of holding on and letting go.\u201d Let go of the clutter you don\u2019t need, and hold on to peace and calm.", "articleBodyHtml": "<article>\n\n<p><strong>The Christmas break is almost upon us and despite the two to three days we may spend with family, the first thing you will go back to when you break for the festive period from your place of work is your home.</strong></p>\n\n<figure><a href=\"http://www.mozzartbet.co.ke/en?utm_source=viraltea&amp;utm_medium=banner_omoka_na_moti&amp;utm_campaign=omoka_na_moti_viraltea#/\">\n<img src=\"https://i1.wp.com/viraltea.co.ke/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/728-x-90.png?w=1170&amp;ssl=1\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\"></a></figure>\n\n<p>A house is a basic need, where one retires to after manhandling the bustling life of the city as well as at work.

In Campus, I took a Degree in pure and applied statistics which wasn\u2019t a perfect fit because am definitely now your white-color-job type of a guy. I really love travelling and exploring new spaces in the digital world.\n\nWhat inspired you to start a tour company? How did it all begin for you?\n\nAfter the Covid-19 pandemic struck, most of us were unlucky to lose our jobs. This gave me enough space to think about so many things. Sincerely speaking, I loved working as a content creator but I didn\u2019t find it sustainable.

I definitely enjoy every single day growing this brand. It comes with its own fair of challenges but they make us better each and every day.\n\nWhat\u2019s the biggest lesson you have picked so far?\n\nAs your grow in business, you have to learn and unlearn so many things. Patience in the business curve is something I have learnt to embrace. Gratitude also, being able to take stock of how far to have come gives you the energy to continue working hard. Consistency, had it not been for the consistency we have developed we wouldn\u2019t be where we are now. Persistence, being an entrepreneur in Kenya is not easy so even during the tough times we definitely toughen up.\n\nHow would you sum up the tourism industry in Kenya?\n\nPersonally, Kenya has so much potential but we really don\u2019t exploit it to the fullest. I really wish the Government could support the sector better. Look at what Rwanda are doing, they are really on the global stage marketing their country with #VisitRwanda, same case in South Africa with #MeetSouthAfrica. If we are able to maximize such opportunities, then we would see a tremendous growth in our industry and that would work to also aid in building our economy because of the foreign exchange that happens in this industry alone.\n\nWhat would you say has contributed to your quick growth?\n\nSocial media and the dedication of our team to convert the enquiries has been key in our steady growth. Also, I have one of the best partners in the business with vast experience in Luxury Travel.\n\nI personally never consider bonfire as our competitors. What we are doing is completely different from what Bonfire are doing. We focus on tailor-made packages while they focus on group travel. The biggest mistake that start-ups make is to enter into a market space to compete with other already established brands instead of building their brands in a specific niche. Don\u2019t get me wrong, I sincerely respect Bonfire and what they do but they are not our competitors in any way.\n\nDo locals really take up these holiday deals?\n\nYes, local travelers actually take up these holiday deals. What most Kenyans lack is someone to show them value in what they are paying which is exactly what we are doing and 70% of our clients are locals.\n\nKajiado never disappoints, This is Oltalet Cottages \ud83d\ude0d pic.twitter.com/Fyl5uDrlpl\n\n\u2014 Let's Discover Travel Ltd (@letsDiscoverke) December 9, 2021\n\nBiggest challenge you have faced?\n\nOur biggest challenge has been having to compete with companies which focus more on moving sales rather than offering value to travelers.

Diana Marua, alias Diana B took a new angle after the controversial gospel artist exposed former EMB signee Weezdom\u2019s name in his defence.\n\nWilly Paul on Thursday, December 9 responded with a video of his own, hours after Marua had accused him of allegedly attempting to sexually assault her nearly three years ago.\n\nHe absolved himself from her accusations, noting that she lied to the public that he attempted to rape her, despite the ideology that she would not believe him.\n\n\u201cI know she won\u2019t believe, but that\u2019s a big lie. I have never raped anyone! Tell your husband (Bahati) the truth.\n\n\u201cTell him that you slept at my house and something happened at that time. Whatever allegations you have against me are not true and you know that\u201d he affirmed, adding that he only gave her his number and Instagram details.\n\nHe likened the relationship between himself and Weezdom to that of brotherhood, thus he revealed to him that he had a one-night stand with Marua.\n\n\u201cI opened up to him and told him that there was a thing that happened between Marua and I but it was less than 24 hours ago. I told him and he was shocked, like two to three months ago, he came out and told me that she had confirmed that it took place and that she had no idea how it happened, so she did not want anyone to know about it,\u201d he narrated, affirming to Marua to stop lying to the public.\n\nHowever, Weezdom responded in an update on his Instagram post that he would try to settle the issue with Willy Paul in private through friends and family before providing his side of the story.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m aware that I\u2019ve been mentioned severally by Pozze about whatever that is going on. Amidst all the allegations from Diana\u2019s story\u2026Bahati na Willy Paul are True Brothers and both are my friends we\u2019ll try to see if we can settle this privately through Friends and Family.\n\n\u201cIf it won\u2019t materialise, the truth shall set the innocent free,\u201d said Weezdom.\n\nWilly Paul on Friday, December 10 released a press statement declaring that he would be suing Marua for defamation and character assassination, adding that Bahati is using his wife to settle his long-standing rivalry with him.\n\n\u201cI am shocked by the false and utter defamatory allegations labelled against me by D, my longtime friend, the same has injured my reputation as a parent, father and public figure.\n\n\u201cThe allegations of attempted rape by D are baseless and orchestrated to win public sympathy, D\u2019s crocodile tears have served the purpose and the poor masses are buying to it. I believe B is behind the scenes using the wife to fight his battles,\u201d he faulted the couple in the statement.\n\nView this post on Instagram\n\nA post shared by W.I.L.L.Y.P.O.Z.Z.E (@willy.paul.msafi)\n\nIn his defence, he affirmed that he has never sexually assaulted any woman in his life and would never imagine himself doing so.\n\n\u201cI was raised by a woman and I owe my whole career to a woman who held my hand when I was na\u00efve and on diapers in the industry. The women in my life have always been my greatest inspiration some have given me children, whom I treasure more than anything. I cannot and will never assault a woman sexually,\u201d he defended.\n\nTaking to her YouTube channel on Thursday, December 9, a teary Marua narrated how a few years back, Willy Paul had been pursuing her while she was living along Mombasa Road at Great Wall Apartments around the Syokimau area.\n\nMarua recalled how she met the controversial gospel singer at a movie shop while he flirted with her. He had invited her to his house but she turned him down on the basis that she did not know him well.\n\nWilly Paul then lured her into his car as an alternative, locked the doors of the vehicle thus trapping her inside with him before he sped off. He then took Marua to an apartment and invited her to climb up to his house, but she refused and demanded to be dropped back home.\n\nAngered, he tried to force her up into his house and allegedly attempted to assault her sexually.\n\n\u201c He came on top of me and he started pulling my skirt up \u2026he\u2019s tearing my skirt and my top so I\u2019m like what are you doing, I\u2019m trying to scream and trying to tell him to get off me. So I started screaming, this guy was choking me so that I cannot scream,\u201d she went on.\n\nWilly Paul was taken aback by the screams and moved away from her. Marua saw the move as a chance to escape from the apartment with torn clothes and into the darkness surrounding the murram road until she spotted a boda boda rider who came to her aid.", "articleBodyHtml": "<article>\n\n<ul><li>\n<a href=\"https://viraltea.co.ke/twist-in-willy-paul-diana-marua-drama-as-weezdom-mentioned/?post_action=like\">\n (25)\n</a></li></ul>\n\n<p><strong>The <a href=\"https://viraltea.co.ke/willy-paul-tried-to-rape-me-diana-marua-video/\" title=\"https://viraltea.co.ke/willy-paul-tried-to-rape-me-diana-marua-video/\">rape saga between Kenyan singer Wilson Abubakar Radido, alias Willy Paul and rapper Diana Marua</a>, alias Diana B took a new angle after the controversial gospel artist exposed former EMB signee Weezdom\u2019s name in his defence.</strong></p>\n\n<p>Willy Paul on Thursday, December 9 responded with a video of his own, hours after Marua had accused him of allegedly <a href=\"https://viraltea.co.ke/willy-paul-tried-to-rape-me-diana-marua-video/\" title=\"https://viraltea.co.ke/willy-paul-tried-to-rape-me-diana-marua-video/\">attempting to sexually assault her</a> nearly three years ago.</p>\n\n<p>He absolved himself from her accusations, noting that she lied to the public that he attempted to rape her, despite the ideology that she would not believe him.</p>\n\n<p>\u201cI know she won\u2019t believe, but that\u2019s a big lie.

I bought it Kitambo. I thought we talked about this\u2026,\u201d he replied.\n\nKageni has been ruling the airwaves for many years, with his voice the main point of attraction to his millions of listeners countrywide who tune in to his conversations every morning.\n\nHe has been covering some of the most popular topics in Kenya; from relationships to current affairs and has won the hearts of many Kenyan women.\n\nSo precious are his vocals that on Friday, June 11, he revealed that he had insured his voice for Ksh100 million, catching King\u2019ang\u2019i by surprise after he joked about Kageni\u2019s career coming to an end in the event he lost his voice.\n\n\u201cYou haven\u2019t insured yours? Mine is insured for Ksh100 million,\u201d Kageni said while laughing at King\u2019ang\u2019is jokes on the show.\n\nThe media personality, whom many have come to love and admire, has on previous interviews disclosed that he landed his first radio job by luck.\n\nIn 1996, he had returned to Kenya from the UK when he approached Capital FM looking to advertise a product. On reaching the station, he was asked for Ksh40,000 for the voice over and since he did not have the money, he said he would do it.\n\nThe bosses at Capital FM loved his voice and that ignited his radio career. A few months into working at Capital, he was recruited by Nation and later by Radio Africa where his salary witnessed a rise by three times.\n\nTwo weeks ago Kageni addressed rumours that he might be eyeing a political seat. He, however, announced that he has absolutely no interest in joining politics, adding that one needs to be a political party subject to survive in the Kenyan political scene.\n\nHowever it is not the same case with many radio presenters who announced they would quit their roles to focus on political seats in 2022, the latest being comedian Felix Odiwour, alias Jalang\u2019o who hosts the Kiss 100 breakfast show and Alex Mwakideu of Milele FM.", "articleBodyHtml": "<article>\n\n<p><strong><a href=\"https://viraltea.co.ke/my-voice-is-insured-for-ksh100-million-maina-kageni/\" title=\"https://viraltea.co.ke/my-voice-is-insured-for-ksh100-million-maina-kageni/\">Classic 105 FM presenter Maina Kageni</a> has announced that he will retire from his lucrative job in 2022, having dominated the airwaves for many years.</strong></p>\n\n<figure><a href=\"http://www.mozzartbet.co.ke/en?utm_source=viraltea&amp;utm_medium=banner_omoka_na_moti&amp;utm_campaign=omoka_na_moti_viraltea#/\">\n<img src=\"https://i1.wp.com/viraltea.co.ke/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/728-x-90.png?w=1170&amp;ssl=1\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\"></a></figure>\n\n<p>He revealed during his breakfast show on Thursday, December 9 that he will hang his radio shoes to focus on steering operations of his private business.</p>\n\n<p>Revealing to his co-host Mwalimu King\u2019ang\u2019i, who also serves as comedian Churchill (Daniel Ndambuki)<a href=\"https://viraltea.co.ke/my-voice-is-insured-for-ksh100-million-maina-kageni/\" title=\"https://viraltea.co.ke/my-voice-is-insured-for-ksh100-million-maina-kageni/\"> and they host the popular show Maina and King\u2019ang\u2019i</a>, he unveiled plans to relocate to the United States (US) to start a club in the popular city of Miami, Florida.</p>\n\n<figure><img data-attachment-id=\"11233\" data-permalink=\"https://viraltea.co.ke/im-leaving-radio-in-2022-maina-kageni/unnamed-4/\" data-orig-file=\"https://i0.wp.com/viraltea.co.ke/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/unnamed-4.jpg?fit=625%2C625&amp;ssl=1\" data-orig-size=\"625,625\" data-comments-opened=\"1\" data-image-meta='{\"aperture\":\"0\",\"credit\":\"\",\"camera\":\"\",\"caption\":\"\",\"created_timestamp\":\"0\",\"copyright\":\"\",\"focal_length\":\"0\",\"iso\":\"0\",\"shutter_speed\":\"0\",\"title\":\"\",\"orientation\":\"0\"}' data-image-title=\"unnamed (4)\" data-image-description=\"&lt;p&gt;Classic 105 presenter Maina Kageni. /FILE&lt;/p&gt;\n\" data-image-caption=\"&lt;p&gt;Classic 105 presenter Maina Kageni. /FILE&lt;/p&gt;\n\" data-medium-file=\"https://i0.wp.com/viraltea.co.ke/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/unnamed-4.jpg?fit=300%2C300&amp;ssl=1\" data-large-file=\"https://i0.wp.com/viraltea.co.ke/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/unnamed-4.jpg?fit=625%2C625&amp;ssl=1\" src=\"https://i0.wp.com/viraltea.co.ke/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/unnamed-4.jpg?resize=625%2C625&amp;ssl=1\" alt=\"\" srcset=\"https://i0.wp.com/viraltea.co.ke/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/unnamed-4.jpg?w=625&amp;ssl=1 625w, https://i0.wp.com/viraltea.co.ke/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/unnamed-4.jpg?resize=300%2C300&amp;ssl=1 300w, https://i0.wp.com/viraltea.co.ke/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/unnamed-4.jpg?resize=150%2C150&amp;ssl=1 150w, https://i0.wp.com/viraltea.co.ke/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/unnamed-4.jpg?resize=600%2C600&amp;ssl=1 600w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 625px) 100vw, 625px\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\"><figcaption>Classic 105 presenter Maina Kageni. /FILE</figcaption></figure>\n\n<p>\u201cCome next year I am done.

This being the highest point in our land, we wanted to declare to one and all that Kenya was finally independent.\n\nThe joy of December 12th is that we celebrate two critical milestones of our independence journey. And I say so because the transfer of power from the British colonizers to our Founding Fathers took place in three steps over a period of 18 months.\n\nThe first step was achieved after the May 27th election of 1963. This election ushered in our self-rule on June 1st, 1963.\n\nAnd with this step, the First Prime Minister of Kenya, Mzee Jomo Kenyatta became the Head of Government. But the Queen of England remained the Head of State. This means that we were free; but not free.\n\nSix months later, the second milestone was achieved when we gained independence on December 12th, 1963. On this day, we gathered here at the Garden of the People, hoisted our national flag and played our national anthem for the first time.\n\nAnd as we did this, we were reminded that our National Flag is not just a piece of cloth decorated with ink; or a sentimental display of colours without history.\n\nOur Flag is a symbol of the national wounds and the scars we bear from the liberation war. It is a picture of the battles we fought; those we won and those we lost. And because the ultimate act of every great warrior is to lay down his weapon, the shield and spears on our National Flag symbolize victory.\n\nBut even with independence, a national flag and a national anthem, the Queen of England continued to serve as Kenya\u2019s Head of State. This meant that we were free; but not free.\n\nIt took us one full year to get to the third and final milestone of our liberation. This happened on December 12th, 1964 when the Queen of England vacated her position as Head of State. And with this act, Kenya transitioned into a full Republic or Jamhuri marking the total liberation of our country.\n\nOn this memorable day in 1964, we returned to this Garden of the People to launch the Republic of Kenya and inaugurate its First President. And on the same day, the Governor-General, who became the last expatriate occupant of Government House, left Kenya.\n\nTo commemorate this change of guard, the First President planted a Mugumo tree at the exact spot where our flag had been hoisted at midnight of December 12th, 1963. That 57-year-old tree stands tall and proud to my right as a symbol of our struggle dating back 100 years ago in the 1920s.\n\nThis December 12th is therefore a joyous day for Kenya because we mark the 58th Anniversary of our Independence and the 57th Celebration of our becoming a Republic.\n\nAs we mark this historic day, some will tell you that history is meaningless, unnecessary, useless and irrelevant to the concerns of the present. I beg to differ. History provides invaluable lessons to be learnt and gives context to the present. By looking back, we are better able to look forward.\n\nLearning from the past means we can build on its good, avoid its mistakes and most importantly it is a constant reminder of the ugly. So that even, as we forgive, we should never forget.\n\nFellow Kenyans, Ladies and Gentlemen, Why did our Founding Fathers choose Uhuru Gardens as the place to celebrate Independence Day in 1963 and the republic status in 1964? Why did they want generations to memorize about our history, the untold atrocities visited upon our people and the evil associated with colonial rule?\n\nThe grounds on which we sit here today were also known as the Langata Concentration Camp. During the liberation war, this concentration camp was the most notorious clearing house for our liberation fighters.\n\nIn fact, it is estimated that up to 10,000 of our gallant and most feared liberators were confined in this camp at some point or another. And most of them did not survive the wrath of the colonizer.\n\nLangata Camp has been described in the books of history as resembling the Nazi Camps in Germany, both in its psychological warfare and its methods of brutality. In fact, using \u2018quack scientists\u2019, the colonizers argued that devotion to the cause of Mau Mau was a mental illness. And the only way to deal with it was by creating mass detention camps where \u2018shock therapy\u2019 and torture would be administered as a cure.\n\nAnd that was part of the logic they used to create the Langata Concentration Camp where we are seated today.\n\nBy creating this garden as a place of remembrance, our Founding Fathers wanted generations to recall the darkness of our colonial past, but not to be stuck in the pessimism that dark memories can breed. They wanted us to turn darkness into positive energy the way they did it in the concentration camps.\n\nInstead of breaking down in the camps, colonial brutality only made them stronger. But there are other reasons why our Founding Fathers brought us to this place of national remembrance.\n\nEach time we gather here, they wanted us to face our national fears and demons with courage. More so because, no condition is permanent. They wanted us to \u201c\u2026never question in the dark, decisions we made in the light\u201d. Mainly because the long walk to freedom was a walk of faith.\n\nMost of our liberators had no idea whether or when freedom would come. In fact, they confessed in their memoires that many times they had doubt that their cause would ever see the light of the day.\n\nAnd although their walk to freedom was long and hard, the only thing that sustained them was the burning conviction of the rightness of their cause. They were troubled on every side, but not distressed. They were perplexed, but did not despair.\n\nFellow Kenyans, Ladies and Gentlemen, Whenever we congregate at this place of remembrance, we are called to renew the Soul of the Nation. We are called to appreciate the pain felt and sacrifices made, by those who went before us.\n\nThe fallen soldiers and heroes buried in unmarked graves in prisons and camps all over the country. That is why the project under construction before you at this site was initiated.\n\nApart from being a place of remembrance and healing, this place will be an arena where the past, the present and the future will converge.\n\nWhen Kenyans walk through the Heroes Boulevard, their spirits will be edified by the sacrifices our liberators made. And at the end of this boulevard, there will be the tomb of the unknown warrior.\n\nA warrior whose name we do not know, although he died in battle for our country. A warrior whose\nmother let him go, and both mother and son sacrificed so that we can be free.\n\nOnce completed, this place of history will rekindle memories of our armed struggle, but also the good, the bad and the ugly of our history. At the Hall of Legends, it will bring alive our legendary ancestors including Mzee Jomo Kenyatta, Mekatilili wa Menza, Koitalel arap Samoei, Jaramogi Oginga Odinga and Nabongo Mumia among others.\n\nAt the Tunnel of Martys, we will have a solemn memorial to each and every Kenyan who lost their lives in the many watershed moments. These will range from the First to Second World War all the way to the victims of the post election violence of 2008.\n\nIn the Rope Gallery of this museum, a named rope will be dedicated to every one of the one thousand and ninety (1,090) heroic souls that were hanged during the colonial era. And at the Moments of Darkness Gallery, we shall display the histories of our lowest moments, the moments that we regret but are part of our history.\n\nBut not all galleries display sad news. The Hall of Innovation in this museum will celebrate the brilliant and game-changing ideas produced by Kenyans. This Hall will speak to the coming future and how our past has guided it. The Hall that is just behind me, marked by a spear pointing up, characterizes our latest exploits, our moments of great hope and national pride, and our bold path into the future.\n\nThis place will be a book of history and illumination of the future, weaved in hope, written in pictures, sculptures and historical artifacts. And although the place of remembrance is a place of national pain, it will also be an altar for historical forgiveness.\n\nAs Kenyans walk through the galleries of heroes and legends, they must forgive those who trespassed against us. However, they must also heed the call from our Founding Father when he said: \u201cWe will Forgive them; but we will NEVER Forget\u201d. We must forgive our transgressors; but we must never forget their name.\n\nFellow Kenyans, Ladies and Gentlemen,\nFinally, our Founding Fathers brought us to this Garden of remembrance to teach us that nation building is not a sprint; it is a relay. No single person or group of persons can make this undertaking alone.\n\nLiberation was achieved because it was a product of teamwork. And it must be recorded that the Founding Fathers were not a team because they worked together. They were a team because they reinforced each other and had deep respect, and trust for one another.\n\nThey taught us that nation-building is like building a house. This endeavor is indeed a product of teamwork, not individualism. They built a firm foundation for a prosperous\nKenya.\n\nOthers amongst them built the walls and others roofed the house. Everyone had a role to play. And no role was greater than the other.\n\nThe same is today as it was then. We are building a house called Kenya and there is no place for one-manism in this project. It is the collective work of every able-bodied Kenyan.\n\nAnd yes, we will disagree sometimes, but in our disagreements, we must remain respectful. In fact, respectful disagreements are what lead to reconciliation. More so because when we disagree, it is a sign that we are making progress.\n\nThe making of a nation and the building of a house are also living processes. They cannot be static; they must be dynamic.\n\nErrors are made sometimes and renovations must correct them after the house is completed. In December 1991, we discovered that the one party system was a design error in our nationhood. And the advancement of the Republic had outlived its usefulness. We made renovations and changed the system.\n\nIn 2007, we ran into another architectural defect in our nation-building project. We discovered that the politics of exclusion in which the \u2018winner takes it all\u2019 was not good for our country. We were bold enough to change the Constitution and expand the executive in order to accommodate the excluded.\n\nAnd when the former Prime Minister, Rt. Hon. Raila Odinga and I shook hands on March 8th, 2018, it was because we saw a crack on the wall of our nation. We had run two elections that costed the country KSh. 1 trillion in business loses and we were staring at a nation divided right in the middle.\n\nBecause we had disagreed respectfully, we knew that this was a mark of progress. It was difficult, but the necessity, the reason and the recognition that we as Kenyans needed each other, nation before self, as our forefathers had taught us to come together, reinforced our resolve. Therefore, the need to come together and mend the crack on the wall of our nation necessitated the first amendment to our Constitution.\n\nAnd although it encountered some legal obstacles, I can only say that BBI is just a dream deferred. One day, someday, it will happen, because the country cannot survive ethnic majoritarianism and exclusion just as it cannot survive unfair and skewed representation. This is a design defect that we must fix.\n\nFellow Kenyans, Ladies and Gentlemen, This Garden of the People, therefore, is not just a place of remembrance. It was gifted to us as a place where generations shall tell stories of where we have come from, where we are and where we are going.\n\nIt is an arena of truth narrated before God; verified by history and reinforced by the acts of our Founding Fathers. And if it is a convergence point between our past and our present, it must also guide our future.\n\nAllow me now to conclude with a thought about the future. If the Asian Tigers were at the same level of development as Kenya in 1963 and Kenya actually lent South Korea some money to implement its development plan in 1963, the question is what happened? Why were we unable to develop as fast as they did?\n\nThis future did not happen because we failed to plan for it. This future evaded us because we failed to imagine it. And I say so because imagination is more powerful than knowledge. For the past to have an impact on our future, we must constantly imagine and re-imagine the future.\n\nAs we envision the future, we are reminded that in eight years, our Economic Blue Print, that is, the Kenya Vision 2030 will have run its course. By then, Kenya will be home to a projected 63 million citizens; and as Kenya turns 100 in 2063, we will be home to 100 million citizens. For us to secure the elusive shared prosperity and inter-generational equity; we must be bold in our imagination of Kenya at 100.\n\nBut, our imagination cannot follow the popular path; it must follow the bold path. Indeed, Vision 2063 must be a bold imagination of what Kenya will be at 100 years. The solemn duty of framing of how this vision looks like is the task of our generation.\n\nAs our children walk through the Boulevard of Heroes in this park and play in the Pavilion of Reflection, what account of ourselves will we have left in this unedited place of history? It must be written in this unedited book of history that, we chose the bold path over the popular path. The Lion is \u201c\u2026not the strongest animal in the Savannah. Neither is it the biggest. Neither is it the most shrewd. But, it is the boldest\u201d. And this attitude of boldness is what makes the lion, the King of the Jungle.\n\nIndeed, this is the reason it is said that \u201c\u2026an army of sheep led by a lion can defeat an army of lions led by a sheep.\u201d The future of Kenya, inspired by the past and the present, must be about brave imagination.\n\nThis is why I congratulate the 19th Infantry Battalion of the Kenya Army, whom I have coloured today. We must celebrate our Defence Forces because when they go to war in defense of our borders, they know too well that they will either return hoisting our national flag; or return wrapped in our national flag. This takes boldness and dedication.\n\nFellow Kenyans, Ladies and Gentlemen, Now I will end my address by keeping a promise I made. On the 20th October, 2021, I directed the Ministry of Energy to fast-track the implementation of the recommendations of the Presidential Taskforce on Power Purchase Agreements. I am pleased to note that the pathway to reduce the cost of electricity by over 30% is on course.\n\nIn honour of this pledge to the nation, and in response to the concerns over the high cost of electricity raised by both individual consumers and enterprises, I am pleased to announce to the nation that the reduction of the cost of electricity will be implemented in two tranches of 15% each; with the first 15% achieved through initial actions focusing on system and commercial losses, to be reflected in the December bills, and a further 15% reduction, in the first quarter of 2022.\n\nIn realizing the second tranche of the reduction in power bills, I note that the Ministry of Energy has initiated engagements with Independent Power Producers aimed at renegotiation of power purchase agreements; so as to give better value for money for consumers. I urge the power producers to demonstrate goodwill as we seek to make our energy sector a greater catalyst of our national development.\n\nAs we move to the New Year, 2022, I leave you with the words of our Founding President as he wished our new Republic a Merry Christmas 57 years ago. He urged our good men and women to be of service to their fellow countrymen. His New Year message was this: \u201c\u2026let everyone who is educated, teach others to read and write. Let every man who is healthy help a man who is sick. Let every man who has work find some prospect for a man that is poor and not employed. Let service be our inspiration for the future\u2026\u201d.\n\nAnd with this message my beloved Countrymen, I wish you a Merry Christmas and a Prosperous New Year to you all.", "articleBodyHtml": "<article>\n\n<p><strong>Read President Uhuru Kenyatta\u2019s speech to the nation on Jamhuri Day, Sunday December 12, 2021</strong></p>\n\n<p>LEADERS FROM ACROSS THE ENTIRE SPECTRUM OF OUR NATION, MEMBERS OF THE DIPLOMATIC CORPS, LADIES AND GENTLEMEN, FELLOW KENYANS, HAPPY JAMHURI DAY!</p>\n\n<p>Today, I am indeed delighted and privileged to host the 57th Jamhuri Day celebrations here at Uhuru Gardens, the People\u2019s Garden.</p>\n\n<p>This is the exact place where the Union Jack of the British colonizer was lowered and our National Flag hoisted on the midnight of 12th December, 1963.</p>\n\n<p>And as we hoisted our National Flag here at the People\u2019s Garden in Nairobi, a hero by the name of Kisoi Munyao raised the same flag at midnight of Independence Day at the peak of Mount Kenya.

The Hall that is just behind me, marked by a spear pointing up, characterizes our latest exploits, our moments of great hope and national pride, and our bold path into the future.</p>\n\n<p>This place will be a book of history and illumination of the future, weaved in hope, written in pictures, sculptures and historical artifacts. And although the place of remembrance is a place of national pain, it will also be an altar for historical forgiveness.</p>\n\n<p>As Kenyans walk through the galleries of heroes and legends, they must forgive those who trespassed against us. However, they must also heed the call from our Founding Father when he\u00a0 said: \u201cWe will Forgive them; but we will NEVER Forget\u201d. We must forgive our transgressors; but we must never forget their name.</p>\n\n<p>Fellow Kenyans, Ladies and Gentlemen,<br>Finally, our Founding Fathers brought us to this Garden of remembrance to teach us that nation building is not a sprint; it is a relay. No single person or group of persons can make this undertaking alone.</p>\n\n<p>Liberation was achieved because it was a product of teamwork. And it must be recorded that the Founding Fathers were not a team because they worked together. They were a team because they reinforced each other and had deep respect, and trust for one another.</p>\n\n<p>They taught us that nation-building is like building a house. This endeavor is indeed a product of teamwork, not individualism. They built a firm foundation for a prosperous<br>Kenya.</p>\n\n<p>Others amongst them built the walls and others roofed the house. Everyone had a role to play. And no role was greater than the other.</p>\n\n<p>The same is today as it was then. We are building a house called Kenya and there is no place for one-manism in this project. It is the collective work of every able-bodied Kenyan.</p>\n\n<p>And yes, we will disagree sometimes, but in our disagreements, we must remain respectful. In fact, respectful disagreements are what lead to reconciliation. More so because when we disagree, it is a sign that we are making progress.</p>\n\n<p>The making of a nation and the building of a house are also living processes. They cannot be static; they must be dynamic.</p>\n\n<p>Errors are made sometimes and renovations must correct them after the house is completed. In December 1991, we discovered that the one party system was a design error in our nationhood. And the advancement of the Republic had outlived its usefulness. We made renovations and changed the system.</p>\n\n<p>In 2007, we ran into another architectural defect in our nation-building project. We discovered that the politics of exclusion in which the \u2018winner takes it all\u2019 was not good for our country. We were bold enough to change the Constitution and expand the executive in order to accommodate the excluded.</p>\n\n<p>And when the former Prime Minister, Rt. Hon. Raila Odinga and I shook hands on March 8th, 2018, it was because we saw a crack on the wall of our nation. We had run two elections that costed the country KSh. 1 trillion in business loses and we were staring at a nation divided right in the middle.</p>\n\n<p>Because we had disagreed respectfully, we knew that this was a mark of progress. It was difficult, but the necessity, the reason and the recognition that we as Kenyans needed each other, nation before self, as our forefathers had taught us to come together, reinforced our resolve. Therefore, the need to come together and mend the crack on the wall of our nation necessitated the first amendment to our Constitution.</p>\n\n<p>And although it encountered some legal obstacles, I can only say that BBI is just a dream deferred. One day, someday, it will happen, because the country cannot survive ethnic majoritarianism and exclusion just as it cannot survive unfair and skewed representation. This is a design defect that we must fix.</p>\n\n<p>Fellow Kenyans, Ladies and Gentlemen, This Garden of the People, therefore, is not just a place of remembrance. It was gifted to us as a place where generations shall tell stories of where we have come from, where we are and where we are going.</p>\n\n<p>It is an arena of truth narrated before God; verified by history and reinforced by the acts of our Founding Fathers. And if it is a convergence point between our past and our present, it must also guide our future.</p>\n\n<p>Allow me now to conclude with a thought about the future. If the Asian Tigers were at the same level of development as Kenya in 1963 and Kenya actually lent South Korea some money to implement its development plan in 1963, the question is what happened? Why were we unable to develop as fast as they did?</p>\n\n<p>This future did not happen because we failed to plan for it. This future evaded us because we failed to imagine it. And I say so because imagination is more powerful than knowledge. For the past to have an impact on our future, we must constantly imagine and re-imagine the future.</p>\n\n<p>As we envision the future, we are reminded that in eight years, our Economic Blue Print, that is, the Kenya Vision 2030 will have run its course. By then, Kenya will be home to a projected 63 million citizens; and as Kenya turns 100 in 2063, we will be home to 100 million citizens. For us to secure the elusive shared prosperity and inter-generational equity; we must be bold in our imagination of Kenya at 100.</p>\n\n<p>But, our imagination cannot follow the popular path; it must follow the bold path. Indeed, Vision 2063 must be a bold imagination of what Kenya will be at 100 years. The solemn duty of framing of how this vision looks like is the task of our generation.</p>\n\n<p>As our children walk through the Boulevard of Heroes in this park and play in the Pavilion of Reflection, what account of ourselves will we have left in this unedited place of history? It\u00a0 must be written in this unedited book of history that, we chose the bold path over the popular path. The Lion is \u201c\u2026not the strongest animal in the Savannah. Neither is it the biggest. Neither is it the most shrewd. But, it is the boldest\u201d. And this attitude of boldness is what makes the lion, the King of the Jungle.</p>\n\n<p>Indeed, this is the reason it is said that \u201c\u2026an army of sheep led by a lion can defeat an army of lions led by a sheep.\u201d The future of Kenya, inspired by the past and the present, must be about brave imagination.</p>\n\n<p>This is why I congratulate the 19th Infantry Battalion of the Kenya Army, whom I have coloured today. We must celebrate our Defence Forces because when they go to war in defense of our borders, they know too well that they will either return hoisting our national flag; or return wrapped in our national flag. This takes boldness and dedication.</p>\n\n<p>Fellow Kenyans, Ladies and Gentlemen, Now I will end my address by keeping a promise I made. On the 20th October, 2021, I directed the Ministry of Energy to fast-track the implementation of the recommendations of the Presidential Taskforce on Power Purchase Agreements. I am pleased to note that the pathway to reduce the cost of electricity by over 30% is on course.</p>\n\n<p>In honour of this pledge to the nation, and in response to the concerns over the high cost of electricity raised by both individual consumers and enterprises, I am pleased to announce to the nation that the reduction of the cost of electricity will be implemented in two tranches of 15% each; with the first 15% achieved through initial actions focusing on system and commercial losses, to be reflected in the December bills, and a further 15% reduction, in the first quarter of 2022.</p>\n\n<p>In realizing the second tranche of the reduction in power bills, I note that the Ministry of Energy has initiated engagements with Independent Power Producers aimed at renegotiation of\u00a0 power purchase agreements; so as to give better value for money for consumers. I urge the power producers to demonstrate goodwill as we seek to make our energy sector a greater catalyst of our national development.</p>\n\n<p>As we move to the New Year, 2022, I leave you with the words of our Founding President as he wished our new Republic a Merry Christmas 57 years ago. He urged our good men and women to be of service to their fellow countrymen. His New Year message was this: \u201c\u2026let everyone who is educated, teach others to read and write. Let every man who is healthy help a man who is sick. Let every man who has work find some prospect for a man that is poor and not employed. Let service be our inspiration for the future\u2026\u201d.</p>\n\n<p>And with this message my beloved Countrymen, I wish you a Merry Christmas and a Prosperous New Year to you all.</p>\n\n<figure><img data-attachment-id=\"11452\" data-permalink=\"https://viraltea.co.ke/president-uhuru-kenyattas-jamhuri-day-speech/20211212_140940/\" data-orig-file=\"https://i2.wp.com/viraltea.co.ke/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/20211212_140940.jpg?fit=2048%2C1615&amp;ssl=1\" data-orig-size=\"2048,1615\" data-comments-opened=\"1\" data-image-meta='{\"aperture\":\"0\",\"credit\":\"\",\"camera\":\"\",\"caption\":\"\",\"created_timestamp\":\"0\",\"copyright\":\"\",\"focal_length\":\"0\",\"iso\":\"0\",\"shutter_speed\":\"0\",\"title\":\"\",\"orientation\":\"0\"}' data-image-title=\"20211212_140940\" data-image-description=\"\" data-image-caption=\"\" data-medium-file=\"https://i2.wp.com/viraltea.co.ke/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/20211212_140940.jpg?fit=300%2C237&amp;ssl=1\" data-large-file=\"https://i2.wp.com/viraltea.co.ke/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/20211212_140940.jpg?fit=1024%2C808&amp;ssl=1\" src=\"https://i2.wp.com/viraltea.co.ke/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/20211212_140940.jpg?resize=1024%2C808&amp;ssl=1\" alt=\"\" srcset=\"https://i2.wp.com/viraltea.co.ke/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/20211212_140940.jpg?resize=1024%2C808&amp;ssl=1 1024w, https://i2.wp.com/viraltea.co.ke/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/20211212_140940.jpg?resize=300%2C237&amp;ssl=1 300w, https://i2.wp.com/viraltea.co.ke/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/20211212_140940.jpg?resize=768%2C606&amp;ssl=1 768w, https://i2.wp.com/viraltea.co.ke/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/20211212_140940.jpg?resize=1536%2C1211&amp;ssl=1 1536w, https://i2.wp.com/viraltea.co.ke/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/20211212_140940.jpg?w=2048&amp;ssl=1 2048w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\"></figure>\n\n<p><br></p>\n\n</article>", "canonicalUrl": "https://viraltea.co.ke/president-uhuru-kenyattas-jamhuri-day-speech/"},{"url": "https://viraltea.co.ke/form-three-student-dies-while-playing-football/", "probability": 0.9981997, "headline": "Form Three Student Dies While Playing Football", "datePublished": "2021-12-06T08:53:39+03:00", "datePublishedRaw": "2021-12-06T08:53:39+03:00", "dateModified": "2021-12-06T08:53:44+03:00", "dateModifiedRaw": "2021-12-06T08:53:44+03:00", "author": "By Ivy Wanjiru", "authorsList": ["By Ivy Wanjiru"], "inLanguage": "en", "breadcrumbs": [{"name": "Home", "link": "https://viraltea.co.ke/"}, {"name": "Form Three Student Dies While Playing Football", "link": "https://viraltea.co.ke/form-three-student-dies-while-playing-football/"}], "mainImage": "https://viraltea.co.ke/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/12.png", "images": ["https://i1.wp.com/viraltea.co.ke/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/41_big.jpg?resize=700%2C525&ssl=1", "https://i2.wp.com/viraltea.co.ke/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/20211205_141910.jpg?resize=1024%2C576&ssl=1", "https://i1.wp.com/viraltea.co.ke/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/728-x-90.png?w=1170&ssl=1"], "description": "The student was playing the game within the school compound earlier in the day.", "articleBody": "A Form Three student from Obera Boys Secondary School in Ndhiwa, Homa Bay County died on Sunday, December 5 while he was playing a football game with his schoolmates.\n\nThe student was playing the game within the school compound earlier in the day.

Golf is a sport that is associated with the elite in class as well as senior government officials and at some point, former President Mwai Kibaki was a big fan of golf.</p>\n\n<figure><a href=\"http://www.mozzartbet.co.ke/en?utm_source=viraltea&amp;utm_medium=banner_omoka_na_moti&amp;utm_campaign=omoka_na_moti_viraltea#/\">\n<img src=\"https://i1.wp.com/viraltea.co.ke/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/728-x-90.png?w=1170&amp;ssl=1\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\"></a></figure>\n\n<p>Haji shot down the sport in amusement by stating that it involved grown-ups running after a small ball and that he would rather play football at home.</p>\n\n<p>\u201cI don\u2019t play golf because I am an ordinary person. Chasing a small ball as a grown-up? I would rather stay at home and play football there.</p>\n\n<p>\u201cYou know I learned in Nyahururu DEB primary, so I am just an ordinary person. So those things of golf I do not know. I usually watch it on TV and I wonder why grown-ups would follow such a small ball. Football has a bigger ball,\u201d he revealed.</p>\n\n<p>He added that he prefers playing football during his free time and picked swimming in favour of golf.</p>\n\n<p>\u201cI would prefer playing football or swimming. Golf? Aiiiiiiii,\u201d he replied.</p>\n\n<p>In terms of his time as Director of Public Prosecution (DPP), he stated that he has a term to finish up, but he\u00a0<a href=\"https://viraltea.co.ke/im-ready-to-quit-dpp-haji\">assured that he is ready to leave office</a>\u00a0if found of incompetence and will do so gracefully.</p>\n\n<p>\u201cIf the President sets up a tribunal and the tribunal finds that I have to leave, I am a man of God and believe that God has better plans for me. If PSC feels that I have to go, I cannot be in this seat forever. I recognize that, that\u2019s why I have a term and the term will end,\u201d he noted.</p>\n\n<figure><img src=\"https://i2.wp.com/viraltea.co.ke/uploads/images/202110/image_750x_617aba6f37f22.jpg?w=1170&amp;ssl=1\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\"></figure>\n\n</article>", "canonicalUrl": "https://viraltea.co.ke/dpp-haji-may-have-hinted-at-his-favourite-football-team-video/"},{"url": "https://viraltea.co.ke/detectives-uncover-wedding-plans-of-man-who-killed-bbc-journalist/", "probability": 0.9944449, "headline": "Detectives Uncover Wedding Plans Of Man Who Killed BBC Journalist", "datePublished": "2021-11-23T08:48:37+03:00", "datePublishedRaw": "2021-11-23T08:48:37+03:00", "dateModified": "2021-11-23T08:48:37+03:00", "dateModifiedRaw": "2021-11-23T08:48:37+03:00", "author": "Marvin Chege", "authorsList": ["Marvin Chege"], "inLanguage": "en", "breadcrumbs": [{"name": "Home", "link": "https://viraltea.co.ke/"}, {"name": "Detectives Uncover Wedding Plans Of Man Who Killed BBC Journalist", "link": "https://viraltea.co.ke/detectives-uncover-wedding-plans-of-man-who-killed-bbc-journalist/"}], "mainImage": "https://viraltea.co.ke/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/image_750x415_61992afaec9a2.jpg", "images": ["https://i1.wp.com/viraltea.co.ke/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/728-x-90.png?w=1170&ssl=1"], "description": "(4) The details have pointed out that the suspect was engaged and on the verge of marrying his girlfriend in December this year Fresh details regarding the murder of BBC journalist Kate Mitchell have revealed the wedding and engagement plans of the prime suspect implicated in the murder at a hotel in Westlands, Nairobi on \u2022 Read More \u00bb", "articleBody": "The details have pointed out that the suspect was engaged and on the verge of marrying his girlfriend in December this year\n\nFresh details regarding the murder of BBC journalist Kate Mitchell have revealed the wedding and engagement plans of the prime suspect implicated in the murder at a hotel in Westlands, Nairobi on Friday, November 19.\n\nThe details have pointed out that the suspect was engaged and on the verge of marrying his girlfriend in December this year, plans that did not materialise after he allegedly jumped to his death from the eighth floor, where Mitchell had booked a room in the hotel.\n\nHe had booked a room on the seventh floor with his fianc\u00e9e on the same building, a matter which has puzzled detectives.\n\nHis fianc\u00e9e had patiently waited for her boyfriend, who left her in their hotel room as he went to the bar briefly.

killed by special agents from the Directorate of Criminal Investigations (DCI) on Tuesday morning, December 14, as they attempted to commit a robbery at a supermarket in Ruaka, Kiambu County.\n\nIn the detectives\u2019 report filed on Tuesday, the thugs who were armed with a Ceska pistol loaded with 5 rounds of 9mm caliber, opened fire at the detectives after they declined an order to surrender.\n\nHowever, the sleuths from the Special Service Unit (SSU) responded with gunfire of their own and killed the armed criminals on the spot.\n\n\u201cWhat followed was a deafening hail of

Anyone can transform their 50 shillings to a car with Mozzartbet just like I did,\u201d an elated Airo said.\n\nBeatrice Achieng, a cashier at Kawangware Mozzartbet shop revealed that at some point Airo wanted to change his car-winning ticket after placing his bet but was time-barred.\n\n\u201cHe comes in the morning, picks the fixtures and goes to analyze then comes back later to stake. On Saturday, after staking he became a bit hesitant on his pick in the Westham and Chelsea game and even wanted to cancel the bet but time did not allow. He wanted to bet on Chelsea as opposed to Westham. On Sunday, he came to collect his winnings in the morning and I served him because I was the one at the main counter. At that time, we did not know that he was the winner for the previous day but later the main office called and notified us that the person we had paid was the winner for the day.

You could be the next one who walks away with this car or even the 9 million Kenya shillings house,\u201d Kibichii said.\n\nMozzartbet have two promotions running concurrently: Urban Cruiser and Omoka na Moti with a combined value of Ksh50 million.\n\nThe Urban Cruiser Promotion is a one-off reward for a lucky punter who will have strung together the longest winning multi-bet by 19th December 2021.\n\nThe only conditions tied to Urban Cruiser Promotion is every entry in the bet slip must have 1.35 odds and above with a stake not less than Ksh50.\n\nSo far one punter has led the chase for this Urban Cruiser for over two weeks having mustered a 26-game winning ticket with the closest pursuer stuck on 24 games.\n\nOmoka na Moti Promotion on the other hand gives a car daily to one punter who conjures a winning ticket with the highest accumulation of odds each day. The only conditions attached to this promotion is a fifty bob stake or more for one to qualify.\n\nHow to participate\n\n1. Promotion duration: from 1.12.2021 (00:01 h) to 31.12.2021 (23:59 h)\n\n2. The beginning of all sports events on the ticket must not be earlier than 00:01, December 1st, 2021. Otherwise, the ticket is not taken into account. I.e., it does not meet the conditions for participation in the promotion.\n\n3. All bet slips must be from that promotional day. The beginning of the last sports event that is on the bet slip must be no later than 11:59 PM on the day when the bet slip was played. Bet slips that have matches from several promotional days are not included in the promotion.\n\n4. DAILY PRIZE: The winner of the daily prize i.e. the car, is one participant daily who will have won a multi-bet with the highest total winning odds for that day of December, during the promotion. This means the multi-bet must be won in-order to qualify for the promotion.\n\n5. GRAND PRIZE: On top of the CAR, at the end of December 2021, Mozzart bet will also reward only 1 out of the 31 winners who will have attained the highest total winning odds (best winning ticket out of the 31) with an Apartment in Nairobi.\n\n6. Place a multi-bet of a minimum 4 games.\n\n7. The minimum stake on your Multi-bet must be Ksh 50.\n\n8. If a sporting event in your multi-bet is canceled for any reason, odds of 1 are calculated for that event, but the multi-bet still participates in the prize game, but that sporting event is not taken into account for calculation.\n\n9. In the event that the kick-off of a sporting event is postponed, the ticket still participates in the promotion, but will wait a maximum of 50 hours to confirm the outcome of the event.\n\n10. In case that two or more participants have same total winning odds, the participant who paid the multi-bet first, has the advantage.\n\n11.

He had invited her to his house but she turned him down on the basis that she did not know him well.\n\nWilly Paul then lured her into his car as an alternative, locked the doors of the vehicle thus trapping her inside with him before he sped off.\n\n\u201cI get in the car, the guy locks the car, he drives off and puts loud music so I\u2019m like \u2018What are you doing, where are we going\u2019.

She was under pressure to narrate her story as many women had narrated similar tales to the public but have been ignored.\n\nWilly Paul then took Marua to an apartment and invited her to climb up to his house, but she refused and demanded to be dropped back home.

It\u2019s quite difficult to progress with all this friction,\u201d he noted.\n\nHe announced further that he would close Mulamwah Entertainment indefinitely and that everything Wambo created entirely belongs to her.\n\nAdditionally, he deleted all the songs by Wambo from his end and promised to turn over the videos to her to post wherever she pleases.\n\n\u201cI hereby announce the indefinite closure of Mulamwah ent. Everything created for you belongs to you and you own 100% of your music and all the accounts created.\n\n\u201cAll the songs have been deleted from our end, you\u2019ll be given the videos to post on whatever channel of your choice. All the best,\u201d he addressed her.\n\n\u201cKindly accord her all the support she needs. To the others too, seek solace elsewhere,\u201d he advised.\n\nMulamwah welcomed Wambo in October to his record label as the first signed artist, wishing her the best in her career as he released a new song.\n\n\u201cWelcome to MULAMWAH ENT Vall Wambo as the first signed artist. Wishing you all the best in your career ahead. Meanwhile, Enjoy the cover (Dawa ya Baridi), link on bio\u201d shared Mulamwah.\n\nSpot checks on her Instagram profile revealed that Wambo was only featured in a K24 interview.\n\nThe decision makes his woes much worse after he came out on Tuesday, December 7 in response to the breakup between him and Sonie. He took to Instagram on Tuesday, December 7 to share a photo of him with her seated facing each other, with Sonie just on top of him on a quad bike.\n\nIn his carefully-worded statement, he affirmed that it was only them who knew what happened that led to the termination of the relationship.\n\nHe added that they had separated a long time ago but had to put their house in order before Sonie announced to the public on Monday, December 6 of the development.\n\n\u201cThis is my favourite picture of us in my gallery, only you and I know what memories it evokes and what prevailed after. It has been the best experience with you by my side. Sad, but Carrol & I decided to call it quits.\n\n\u201cWe both decided to separate a very long time ago but we so it fit to also put everything straight that we are no longer together as partners.

National Police College Embakasi B Campus in Nairobi where the graduations were held while the rest of the graduates were posted to their stations.\n\nThe officers whose actions were deemed to have scared members of the public will be probed on how they joined the GSU force for the first time as well as what motivated them to join the force.\n\nShioso noted that the officers were young and very excited about serving the nation for the first time and the day was a big one given that President Uhuru Kenyatta was also in attendance.\n\n\u201cOf course, we understand these are young officers who are full of excitement for their 1st day of service. It was a big day also in terms of the chief guest present but there must be a review of what happened.\n\n\u201cWe can\u2019t make assumptions. We are also seeking to establish their motivation to join the service because they must fit the requirements of modern-day service,\u201d Shioso told the Nation.\n\nThe police spokesperson also said that the investigations will also seek to establish the exact number of officers in the video before enforcing disciplinary action against them.\n\nThe group was part of the 2,502 constables who graduated as GSU officers at the National Police Training College in Embakasi B Campus after rigorous training at the Magadi Training Camp in Kajiado County.\n\nBecause of the vigorous training that the unit undergoes, the GSU is one of the most disciplined units in the police force and one of the most feared within the NPS.\n\nIts officers join the elite teams such as the Presidential Escort and Recce Squad, with others deployed as riot control and provision of security to foreign airlines.\n\n\u201cYour unit in particular and your reputation for bravery, excellence and unfailing commitment to duty is also unrivalled which also I believe is a sign of the discipline and excellent training that is at the heart of GSU training. I call upon you graduates today to ensure that the GSU flame of excellence continues to burn,\u201d President Uhuru said during his call to the graduates.\n\nShioso was thus surprised at their behaviour given that the unit exudes one of the highest standards of discipline among the police units.\n\n\u201cI personally took a while to understand why they had done it. This is our premium and the most tactical unit that we rely on because of its discipline. More is expected especially on the unit\u2019s officers, they should be beyond reproach,\u201d he noted.\n\nThe video seen by Viral Tea showed the officers filming themselves making insensitive comments in Sheng, particularly war cries seemingly aimed at members of the public, if not their enemies.\n\nNPS issued a statement on the matter later on Wednesday after it sparked uproar across the country, affirming that action would be taken against the officers.\n\nIt termed their behaviour as unacceptable to the values of the police force in the country, noting that all its graduands went through rigorous training designed to make them responsible officers to better serve Kenyans.\n\n\u201cAttention of the National Police Service is drawn to a video clip circulating on social media depicting newly graduated General Service Unit (GSU) officers recording themselves as they make some irresponsible and reckless remarks. We wish to clarify and assure the public that the behaviour portrayed in the clip is not acceptable and does not reflect the values of the GSU, Kenya Police Service and the National Police Service.\n\n\u201cAll graduands went through a rigorous value-based training modelled on democratic policing principles and designed to make them responsive and responsible officers of the law at the service of citizens.

Alternative route advised if drive along that route,\u201d a pedestrian was quoted by Ma3Route on Twitter.\n\nThe Head of State was accompanied by Sports CS Amina Mohamed and Head of Public Service Dr Joseph Kinyua among other senior government officials during the unveiling of the statue.\n\nAlso present was the family of the late political supremo, celebrated for \u2018majimboism\u2019, a precursor of modern-day devolution, led by his son and former long-serving Cabinet Minister, Hon Noah Katana Ngala.\n\nThe unveiling follows Uhuru\u2019s return from Tanzania where he oversaw the signing of eight bilateral agreements after bilateral talks between Kenyan and Tanzanian delegations that he led alongside his Tanzanian counterpart Samia Suluhu Hassan at State House in Dar es Salaam.\n\nOn Sunday, December 12, he is expected to inaugurate the refurbished Uhuru Gardens in Nairobi while at the same capacity hosting the Jamhuri Day celebrations from there, expected to draw roughly 11,000 people under strict COVID-19 protocols.\n\nThe late Ronald Ngala was a politician who served as leader of the Kenya African Democratic Union (KADU) political party and has been standing by it from its formation in 1960 until it was dissolved in 1964.\n\nHe was born in 1922 at Gotani in Kilifi County. In 1929 the family moved to Vishakani near Kaloleni, which became his permanent residence.\n\nNgala attended the Alliance High School and Makerere University College where he got a teaching diploma. He worked as a teacher in the coastal region before being promoted to be the headmaster of Mbale Secondary School in Taita-Taveta District.

President William Ruto was frozen by the security detail at the VIP entrance and responded to the hostile welcome by shouting down the officers who had shoved her off the barricade.\n\nShe could be

Jubilee Party officials are also at the event having been invited by the ODM leader.\n\nMany pundits and political analysts believe this will be the occasion that Raila declares his bid for State House in 2022 for the fifth time.\n\nAlready Bungoma Senator Moses Wetangula and Amani National Congress (ANC) party leader Musalia Mudavadi confirmed that they would not be in attendance for the event.\n\n\u201cI received an invitation from my brother Hon R A Odinga party leader ODM to attend his Azimio event tomorrow.
