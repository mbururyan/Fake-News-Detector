motivational speaker after facing a lot of criticism, following her wedding with Guardian Angel, a man who is almost half her age.\n\nTaking to her Instagram account, the sassy mother of three said she doesn\u2019t need validation from anyone.\n\nAccording to her, happy women are not the married ones or those who are single with stable careers and good incomes, but those who chose to love themselves truly and forget about their past.\n\nShe advised women to stop playing victims and move past their anger, tears and bitterness.\n\nAccording to Esther, happiness is a personal choice.\n\nHer long post reads: The happiest women today are not the married ones. They\u2019re not the single ones.\n\n\u201cThey\u2019re not the ones with stable careers and good incomes. The happiest women are the ones who made a choice to love themselves wholly and truly.\n\n\u201cWomen who chose to leave the past behind, worked on their self-esteem and put a high price tag on their self-esteem.\n\n\u201cThey stopped playing victims. They stopped whining in self-pity and dining in pity parties. They moved past their anger, tears and bitterness.\n\n\u201cThey realized that happiness is a personal choice and responsibility.\n\n\u201cThey chose to be defined by their present, but not their bitter pasts.\n\n\u201cThey are happy because they don\u2019t need validation from anyone.

No, adult friendships are utilitarian.\n\nBut, perhaps the biggest realisation you will have as an adult is that people have personal obligations. In your 30s, your friend is probably focussed on their career, business, masters, divorce, being cheated on, being broke, sick father, mother, sibling.

You see someone driving a good car you assume they have money. Someone uploads a picture of expensive whisky, we assume they have money.\n\nSome take a picture at the beach, we assume they have money.

And for those who think friendship is a two-way street, and when their expectations are not met, maybe it is time you updated yourselves on the expectations.\n\nThere is no such thing as a balanced friendship. Unless you are one of those transactional folks, whom I respect a lot, in friendships as in a marriage, people take turns being strong, generous and supportive to each other.\n\nBecause in life we have different gifts, strengths and such. I have friends who listen to my sob story when yet another Kisii girl has dumped me. I have friends I give money because they are not in a position. I have friends who bail me out more than I deserve.\n\nBut I am humble enough to know unmerited favors. To know deserved favours.

While I no longer think of marriage and kids and all, if there is any case for marriage I will make is that your first family, well-nurtured is your first line of defense. Secondly, do your best to nurture a working relationship with brothers and sisters and cousins.\n\nThat is for those that can work. And lastly, know your friends. Know your drinking buddies. Know the social friends for banter, memes, and all. Mark those boundaries, water those you can, utilise your time well in each.\n\nAnd when you are in a pit, know the timing matters. While friends should do their best to help their you when the chips are down, know that your woes sometimes may have some awful timing, and some of your friends may not come through as they should. And some, really couldn\u2019t care less. And that is fine.\n\nI will remain grateful to those who show up. I will understand those who are caught up in their own nightmares. I will understand those who don\u2019t have it in their hearts to come through.\n\nBut over the years, what I learn, corporate friendships are the weakest. And for a reason.
