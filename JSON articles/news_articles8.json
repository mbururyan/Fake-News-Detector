State House after more political heavyweights backed his 2022 presidential bid, a move that has put Deputy President William Ruto in a precarious position.\n\nThe latest to abandon Ruto\u2019s camp for Raila\u2019s include West Pokot Governor John Lonyangapuo, his Kilifi counterpart Amason Kingi and Kisii Deputy Governor Joash Maangi, who declared their support for Raila before the Kasarani launch.\n\nKingi, who had earlier dropped hints that he was headed to William Ruto\u2019s UDA camp, last week categorically expressed his support for Raila\u2019s Azimio La Umoja Movement, although he will still retain his new party, Pamoja African Alliance (PAA).\n\nAlso, Defence Cabinet Secretary Eugene Wamalwa\u2019s party \u2013 Democratic Action Party-Kenya (DAP-Kenya) \u2013 that is being launched today, has thrown its support behind Raila Odinga.\n\nAccording to Wamalwa, DAP-Kenya will field candidates for all positions except the presidency and will form a coalition with Raila\u2019s Azimio La Umoja Movement.\n\nApart from CS Wamalwa, Mandera Governor Ali Roba recently said that his United Democratic Movement would support Raila Odinga for the 2022 presidency.\n\n\u201cWe are closely watching the developments of the Azimio la Umoja Movement.\n\n\u201cIt is the interest of every leader to work towards unity and bring Kenyans together like President Uhuru Kenyatta and Raila are doing.

compromising situation with another man\u2019s wife.\n\nThe man only identified as Kangechu and the woman were having a good time, when the man of the house busted them in his bedroom at around 4 am.\n\nBefore Kangechu knew what was happening, he was stabbed several times by the man whom he later learnt was the woman\u2019s husband.\n\nA shocked Kangechu who lives in Joska recounted how he met the woman at Barizi bar in Donholm at around 9 pm, where they enjoyed several rounds of drinks celebrating their newfound friendship.\n\nAs one thing led to the other, they agreed to crown the night in the woman\u2019s house.\n\nBut as they relished the moment at around 4 am, the man of the house suddenly returned from a trip he had taken to Murang\u2019a, only to be confronted by a strange pair

Playstore using the link here>>>\n\nThe gubernatorial contest in Kisii County to succeed Governor James Ongwae, in 2022 has put Dagoreti North MP Simba Arati under the spotlight as he is reported to have rubbed most of the county leaders in the wrong way.\n\nThe contest will attract candidates from four out of the six main clans in the county with exception of Bonchari and Bogetutu clans.\n\nBobasi, Bogirango and Nyaribari clans have more than one candidate save for Bomachoge clan whose only candidate is the outgoing deputy governor Joash Maangi.\n\nMaangi who prides himself for being loyal to his boss and believes in honesty and fairness is keen to use his relationship with Ongwae to clinch Bogetutu clan before seeking support from Bonchari clan adding that his open-mindedness is a tool to capture votes from unexpected quarters.\n\nFrom Bobasi clan, Kisii Women representative Janet Ong\u2019era, Chief Administrative Secretary Ministry of Transport and Infrastructure Chris Obure and Arati are in the race.\n\nNyaribari clan, has Senator Sam Ongeri, Ezekiel Machogu, Rachel Otundo and Charles Matoke from diaspora who are aspiring while from the South Mugirango clan, there are Manson Oyongo and Omingo Magara who are former MPs.\n\nTwo clans- Bonchari and governor Ongwae\u2019s Bogetutu clan will be battlegrounds in what promises to be a tough duel compared to 2013 and 217 general elections.\n\nThough it is still early to figure out who will win and what strengths, opinions on the ground favour, Ong\u2019era, Arati, Maangi and Ongeri quartet as lead aspirants as Ongwae hold the key of outgoing incumbency with his Bogetutu clan tightly behind him which he may unleash to determine his successor.\n\nOngwae\u2019s undisputed grassroots network and financial resources will work in favour of his preferred successor though remain unnamed.\n\nIt remains to be seen how a county facing a myriad of challenges ranging from inadequate infrastructure, lack of water and, and unemployment will vote their next governor to succeed Ongwae, whose signature achievement is the improvement and refurbishing of Kisii Teaching and Referral Hospital (KTRH).\n\nVoters in the county of Kisii are observing with keen interest how the candidatures of Arati, Ong\u2019era and Ongeri will play out in the dominant party, Orange Democratic Movement (ODM) party primaries where only one of them will be picked as flag-bearer.\n\nArati, may find it an uphill task to mend fences with the Catholic Church following a fracas that occurred last week at Nyamagwa Parish in Bobasi, where he allegedly stormed out of Cathedral after he was \u201cdenied\u201d a chance to address the congregation.\n\nCritics argue that Arati\u2019s aggressive and intimidating personality will ruin his gubernatorial bid unless he spruced up the negative reputation.\n\nThe Diocese of Kisii head Bishop Joseph Mairura, the Pope\u2019s representative to Kenya, Hubertus Matheus Maria, Ford Kenya leader Moses Wetangula, MPs, Chris Wamalwa (Kimilili), Ezekiel Machogu (Nyaribari Masaba) and the host MP Innocent Obiri (Bobasi) attended the function.\n\nIt must be observed that the Dagoretti North MP is perceived to have fallen out with almost all elected leaders in Kisii county from Ongwae, Ongeri, Ong\u2019era and Obiri who is from Arati\u2019s Bobasi clan.\n\nHe is reported to have uttered some unkind words to the said leaders. It\u2019s foolhardy to attack governor Ongwae in his Bogetutu backyard and expect members of his clan to vote for you.\n\nSenator Ongeri is more experienced followed by Janet Ong\u2019era as an ODM insider and former executive director of the party.\n\nParty insiders claim that it is Ong\u2019era who fronted Arati as a civic nominee for Nairobi in 2007 thereby, catapulting him to public limelight and five years later, that is 2013, he successfully vied for Dagoretti North parliamentary seat and in 2017 respectively.\n\nA major disadvantage of Ms Ong\u2019era is her gender because Gusii land too is patriarchal. However, it is changing gradually and recent by-election in Bonchari in which United Democratic Alliance (UDA) candidate Ms Theresa Oyioka lost with a margin of one thousand votes behind Pavel Oimeke of ODM.\n\nUnlike in Nairobi, the entry of Arati in the gubernatorial race has completely altered the political theme in the Kisii region due to its combative and abrasive nature which is alien to rural voters as some are scared while others have embraced it.\n\nSceptics liken Arati\u2019s brand of politics to that of former governors for Nairobi Mike Sonko and Ferdinand Waititu.\n\nMurmurs on the ground are directed at, his Boda Boda supporters who have on a number of occasions exhibited lawlessness towards his perceived political opponents.\n\nThough the youthful MP who celebrated his 40 th birthday last week is still viewed as an \u201coutsider\u201d in Gusiiland politics by virtue of holding a parliamentary seat in a city-county, he has tried to build a sizeable following in the county\u2019s nine constituencies.\n\nIn the ODM party, he is rated highly as a great mobilizer. On development, he has helped in many fundraisers for many churches and self-help groups besides contributing iron sheets for poor families to put up residential structures.\n\nIt remains to be seen how far Arati\u2019s dalliance with the only senior elected Kisii MP Richard Onyonka of Kitutu Chache South will go.\n\nOnyonka, is known to be flip-flopping on parties as his modus operandi, but his oratory skills and articulate expressions may work for Arati.\n\nSome ardent supporters of Arati are already throwing caution in the air saying that holding the grip of the county till August 9, 2022, requires wisdom, well calculated and executed strategies.\n\n\u201cThe fastest swimmer is the first one to drown,\u201d said Sally Ombasa of Igare Market.\n\nOther sources from ODM opine that Arati\u2019s superb mobilization skills are a boon for \u201cBaba\u2019s\u201d campaign in Nairobi thus Raila may prevail upon him to shelve his gubernatorial ambition to remain in the city leadership.\n\nIn Kenya\u2019s political culture, success is largely determined by the deep pockets, clannism, tribalism or ethnicity one is attached to unlike advanced democracies, where policies and manifestoes hold key to success as money comes second.\n\nAs Justus Ondari of Nyagesenda village put it, \u201c Mkono mtupu haulambwi \u201d (You can\u2019t lick an empty hand). Arati\u2019s deep pocket has the capacity to take care of a market crowd all individually,\u201d he added.\n\nIn a rejoinder, a taxi driver- Vincent Okenye-is cagey about cash handouts saying that aspirants should instead focus more on policies and manifestoes and where need be use their personal wealth to initiate development projects rather than engage in dishing out cash.\n\nFor Ms Ong\u2019era, her perceived good performance at the helm of the ODM secretariat and the good rapport she has with top party echelons may favour her in a bid to clinch the ticket for the race as it is echoed that during her heydays the party won the majority seats in elections.\n\nDuring her stint at the senate, Ong\u2019era has initiated an agri-business concept geared at empowering women and youth groups on poultry rearing across the county.\n\nShe also is in sync with small business operators in Kisii, Keroka and Ogembo Towns where she has donated umbrellas for those who operate at the open-air markets.\n\nVoters perceive her as affable, motherly, and approachable. She referred to as \u201cMama Christmas\u201d in Kisii town for sharing goodies with vulnerable groups every festive season. Besides, she has donated water tanks to many schools, and churches within the county.\n\nFor Senator Ongeri, despite his closeness to the ODM leader Raila Odinga, his bid may be disadvantaged because he is not regarded as a solid party insider.\n\nHe is viewed as a Johnny come lately in ODM.

However, it is changing gradually and recent by-election in Bonchari in which United Democratic Alliance (UDA) candidate Ms Theresa Oyioka lost with a margin of one thousand votes behind Pavel Oimeke of ODM.</p>\n\n<p>Unlike in Nairobi, the entry of Arati in the gubernatorial race has completely altered the political theme in the Kisii region due to its combative and abrasive nature which is alien to rural voters as some are scared while others have embraced it.</p>\n\n<p>Sceptics liken Arati\u2019s brand of politics to that of former governors for Nairobi Mike Sonko and Ferdinand Waititu.</p>\n\n<p>Murmurs on the ground are directed at, his\u00a0<em>Boda Boda</em>\u00a0supporters who have on a number of occasions exhibited lawlessness towards his perceived political opponents.</p>\n\n<p>Though the youthful MP who celebrated his 40<sup>th</sup>\u00a0birthday last week is still viewed as an \u201coutsider\u201d in Gusiiland politics by virtue of holding a parliamentary seat in a city-county, he has tried to build a sizeable following in the county\u2019s nine constituencies.</p>\n\n<p>In the ODM party, he is rated highly as a great mobilizer. On development, he has helped in many fundraisers for many churches and self-help groups besides contributing iron sheets for poor families to put up residential structures.</p>\n\n<p>It remains to be seen how far Arati\u2019s dalliance with the only senior elected Kisii MP Richard Onyonka of Kitutu Chache South will go.</p>\n\n<p>Onyonka, is known to be flip-flopping on parties as his modus operandi, but his oratory skills and articulate expressions may work for Arati.</p>\n\n<p>Some ardent supporters of Arati are already throwing caution in the air saying that holding the grip of the county till August 9, 2022, requires wisdom, well calculated and executed strategies.</p>\n\n<p>\u201cThe fastest swimmer is the first one to drown,\u201d said Sally Ombasa of Igare Market.</p>\n\n<p>Other sources from ODM opine that Arati\u2019s superb mobilization skills are a boon for \u201cBaba\u2019s\u201d campaign in Nairobi thus Raila may prevail upon him to shelve his gubernatorial ambition to remain in the city leadership.</p>\n\n<p>In Kenya\u2019s political culture, success is largely determined by the deep pockets, clannism, tribalism or ethnicity one is attached to unlike advanced democracies, where policies and manifestoes hold key to success as money comes second.</p>\n\n<p>As Justus Ondari of Nyagesenda village put it, \u201c<em>Mkono mtupu haulambwi</em>\u201d (You can\u2019t lick an empty hand). Arati\u2019s deep pocket has the capacity to take care of a market crowd all individually,\u201d he added.</p>\n\n<p>In a rejoinder, a taxi driver- Vincent Okenye-is cagey about cash handouts saying that aspirants should instead focus more on policies and manifestoes and where need be use their personal wealth to initiate development projects rather than engage in dishing out cash.</p>\n\n<p>For Ms Ong\u2019era, her perceived good performance at the helm of the ODM secretariat and the good rapport she has with top party echelons may favour her in a bid to clinch the ticket for the race as it is echoed that during her heydays the party won the majority seats in elections.</p>\n\n<p>During her stint at the senate<em>,</em>\u00a0Ong\u2019era has initiated an agri-business concept geared at empowering women and youth groups on poultry rearing across the county.</p>\n\n<p>She also is in sync with small business operators in Kisii, Keroka and Ogembo Towns where she has donated umbrellas for those who operate at the open-air markets.</p>\n\n<p>Voters perceive her as affable, motherly, and approachable. She referred to as \u201cMama Christmas\u201d in Kisii town for sharing goodies with vulnerable groups every festive season. Besides, she has donated water tanks to many schools, and churches within the county.</p>\n\n<p>For Senator Ongeri, despite his closeness to the ODM leader Raila Odinga, his bid may be disadvantaged because he is not regarded as a solid party insider.</p>\n\n<p>He is viewed as a Johnny come lately in ODM. The age factor too may not favour his bid due to the pressure that comes with the coveted seat.</p>\n\n<p>Elsewhere the professor of medicine whose other attribute is an honest statesman is also credited for initiating health and educational projects beyond his Nyaribari clan which include Kenyenya Teachers Training College in Bomachoge.</p>\n\n<p>There are talks of the line-up in which Ongeri, Ong\u2019era and Maangi are said to be inclined to if what was seen in a recent fundraiser in Kitutu Chache North is anything to go by.</p>\n\n<p>As larger communities continue to dominate political leadership on the national platform, the same is happening in the counties where large clans will continue dominating the county leadership.</p>\n\n<p>It is important to note that ODM managed to capture the two gubernatorial seats in Nyamira and Kisii counties largely because of building a team whose membership was drawn from all major clans in which leadership slots for the two counties was shared.</p>\n\n<figure><img data-attachment-id=\"123494\"

has predicted the number of years it will take Kikuyus to clinch the presidential seat again.\n\nSince independence, the Kikuyu community has dominated the presidency, since they are the largest

And yet the most consequential, for better, and lately too frequently, for worse. We will keep it positive today.\n\nIt is important because it will have a huge impact on your mental health later in life. The greatest decision any man will make is picking the right mother for his child (ren). One wrong move and you are tied to an arrangement you will loathe for life.\n\nJust talk to any guy separated from his child and caught up in the horrendous baby-mama-baby-daddy drama, to get a glimpse of how things can go wrong.\n\nSo, if you don\u2019t have a child, guard your seed son.\n\nBut I can see weddings are back in fashion. The Jubilee era killed the wedding economy, but I can see they are back in fashion meaning some men and women are taking risks and we must encourage them.\n\nTo the men, here are a few reminders.\n\n1. Be a man in your marriage.\n\nProvide. Protect. And be the Priest. Lead your family. Lead with firm love. Be understanding and listening. Marriage requires a certain measure of democracy, but half the time, your authority must and should be felt.\n\nDon\u2019t let your education and Netflix mislead you from this traditional role. Just make the right adjustments that are in line with your social and economic reality. But anything short of traditional role, and your marriage will be over before the ink on your marriage certificate will dry.\n\n2. Have standards.\n\nSet them from the outset. If as a man, you have done your part insist on the rules of your house. From dieting to responsibilities, and everything pertaining to your marriage, have some threshold of standards. Many men by the third year of marriage of after the kid arrives are subjected to a very mediocre lifestyle, where the wife doesn\u2019t put in any work whatsoever, but the man is expected to do his role 100 percent.\n\nOur fathers were lucky they didn\u2019t stay with our mothers, but we stay with our wives, most of the time. You deserve good and humane treatment in your marriage.\n\nDon\u2019t be the sorry dude drinking Balozi, scared in the bar, dreading going home because you hate everything about that household. Set the rules from the outset. Lead by example.\n\n3. Tied to number 2, most of the time, your wife will be testing your patience.\n\nSometimes she doesn\u2019t even know it. Sometimes, some women just like drama. And if you are a calm, focused man, many will be the days you will be subjected to drama you have no idea what is going on. Some you have to respond. Some you have to ignore.\n\nThe rule of thumb, if things function 50-70% of the time, you are good. She will piss you off, you will piss her off, but as long the standards are intact, hang around.\n\n4. Eat at home 99 percent of the time, wherever necessary.\n\nIt is healthy, it is affordable. I recently saw a woman drive a petrol station in Lang\u2019ata with her two kids. She bought so much junk. It was a Sunday Evening, traditionally, a day family dinner.\n\nThere was a correlation between how she looked and her kids, and the junk she bought. As a country, the weight epidemic ahead of us has to be addressed at family level, not through social media with hashtags like #StopBodyShaming. Say no junk. Mean it. Go to the kitchen to cook, if you have to. And if you are dating and she doesn\u2019t like cooking, and you want to take her in, just know junk is very expensive buying and the attendant lifestyle diseases will milk your insurance dry. Make the kids like their vegetables.\n\n5. Distance yourself from your in-laws.\n\nDon\u2019t go drinking with your brothers-in-law. Even if her sister is so hot and your loins are on fire and she looks like she is game, don\u2019t. Get some ice. Your father-in-law and mother-in-law are to be treated with maximum respect, if they deserve, and if they don\u2019t keep your distance.\n\nWe never discuss how in-laws ruin marriages. If you are not comfortable with her folk overstaying in your house and running the water bill high, raise your voice.\n\nRaise your voice in pretty much that displeases you. Your voice is what will draw boundaries because most African wives don\u2019t understand the language of boundaries when it comes to the husband and their needs. They only understand boundaries when it is your relatives.\n\n6. Have alcoholic discipline.\n\nThe era where women would pick or clean after piss-drunk husbands is so yesterday. Fall in love with your tipple and you will be given very limited chances.\n\nWhether you are a nerd earning a six-figure salary and you think your money will keep her, you will wake up one day when you are 36 and she will be gone. Know your limits, know when to hang out with the boys, when to hang out with the family. Have a sense of self-awareness son. Some men can drink the entire weekend and run their marriages.\n\nYou will try and she will leave with your son, and you will cry in bars every day. Discipline your alcohol, keep off drugs, and you will save yourself a lot of embarrassing moment.\n\n7. Five years after marriage, your wife will change to something you don\u2019t know.\n\nDepending on where you picked her, the change can be positive or negative. From the age of 28-35, women undergo an existential, mind-altering, experience occasioned by motherhood, personal growth, and general life fears, where she questions her choices, especially her choice of man. Most women in their early 30s, struggle to accept that they made a choice, and some may still put themselves out there in the market.\n\nSome go back to the market but cling to the marriage. Some go back to the market with the hope of quitting the marriage for the better.\n\nIt coincides with her having a very understanding boss called Martin, who promises her a promotion or to set up a business for her. And here so, you may have no chance.\n\nJust watch out for the changes, adjust those you can. And those you can\u2019t handle, don\u2019t beat yourself too hard.\n\nBecause the battle you will be fighting is not yours, but hers and her conscience (see point 10).\n\n8. Cultivate your roots.\n\nFrom the outset, let her know that nothing messes with your family. Introduce her to your rural home and make it a tradition. And for men with no good roots, you have to invent what can pass for roots. Let your kids take your identity.\n\nStick to your cultural naming patterns. Give your kids your identity, so permanent that in the event of a separation, kids will know their home. And the ninja who may take over, has to work to get his kid. Most divorced men who did this, often have a softer landing. Kids like their paternal identity, especially if you do a good job in the formative years.\n\n9. Amerix caught some flak for advising men to have separate secret accounts, companies, and apartments that the wife is not aware of. Most argued, if marriage gets to that point, there is no marriage there bwana.\n\nI have also discussed about at length in my current volume of memos. But my approach has been to have a backup plan. Since most men spend their productive years paying for recurrent expenditure, and in the event, things go South, they end up broke, dejected and with no family.\n\nI wouldn\u2019t recommend such extreme measures, but as a man, live knowing that you are alone, in this world. If the family turns our right and supportive, knock on the wood, you are set.\n\nIt is a safe bet. But down, the line, if kids had to pick who between the mother and the father is to go, it is you the man. With this knowledge, do your best for them, but secure something for yourself.\n\nEarly this week was given a story of a former senior civil servant who lost his job after a regime change and the wife subjected him to a certain level of cruelty that only women whose husbands have lost jobs are capable of, but the man, took it on the chin, studying her, unbelieving what he was seeing.\n\nWhen he had enough, he took his stuff, boarded his matatu, went back to the bundus. What the slay queen wife had never known was that the man is one of the greatest landowners in the Rift Valley and the man took to farming and he is one of the greatest horticulture farmers.\n\nWhat saved the man was that he was discreet. Had he disclosed everything to the slay queen, he would have lost more than the matrimonial property and some few pieces of land in Nairobi. Make of what you may on this story.\n\n10. If one day, for an inexplicable reason, your wife starts to show you madharau, and this persists, hand over the regime to your step-boyfriend. Or hang around for sordid details, for sure as the sun rises in the East and sets in the West, you will learn the hard way.\n\nThe day she starts to act funny, the day she tells you ain\u2019t sh!t, the day your authority will be compromised to a point she is above the law, pack your stuff into a huge polythene bag, leave.\n\nIf you wait for her to kick you out, you will hate yourself for the rest of your life.\n\nOtherwise, all the best son. In the event things don\u2019t work, don\u2019t drive your car to hardy backside of a truck or jump off a bridge, or drink yourself to the grave.\n\nShe won\u2019t care. Just you had a life before marriage, there can be life after marriage.", "articleBodyHtml": "<article>\n\n<p>Download our blog\u2019s APP from Google Playstore using the <a href=\"https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.app.dpapp\">link here&gt;&gt;&gt;</a></p>\n\n<figure><a href=\"https://odibets.com/\"><img src=\"https://kenyan-post.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/1-1.jpg\"></a></figure>\n\n<p><strong>.</strong></p>\n\n<p>{Long Post-10 minutes}</p>\n\n<p>To the young folks who are getting married this December, Congratulations.</p>\n\n<p>You have made the most important decision in your life.

They only understand boundaries when it is your relatives.</p>\n\n<p>6. Have alcoholic discipline.</p>\n\n<p>The era where women would pick or clean after piss-drunk husbands is so yesterday. Fall in love with your tipple and you will be given very limited chances.</p>\n\n<p>Whether you are a nerd earning a six-figure salary and you think your money will keep her, you will wake up one day when you are 36 and she will be gone. Know your limits, know when to hang out with the boys, when to hang out with the family. Have a sense of self-awareness son. Some men can drink the entire weekend and run their marriages.</p>\n\n<p>You will try and she will leave with your son, and you will cry in bars every day. Discipline your alcohol, keep off drugs, and you will save yourself a lot of embarrassing moment.</p>\n\n<p>7. Five years after marriage, your wife will change to something you don\u2019t know.</p>\n\n<p>Depending on where you picked her, the change can be positive or negative. From the age of 28-35, women undergo an existential, mind-altering, experience occasioned by motherhood, personal growth, and general life fears, where she questions her choices, especially her choice of man. Most women in their early 30s, struggle to accept that they made a choice, and some may still put themselves out there in the market.</p>\n\n<p>Some go back to the market but cling to the marriage. Some go back to the market with the hope of quitting the marriage for the better.</p>\n\n<p>It coincides with her having a very understanding boss called Martin, who promises her a promotion or to set up a business for her. And here so, you may have no chance.</p>\n\n<p>Just watch out for the changes, adjust those you can. And those you can\u2019t handle, don\u2019t beat yourself too hard.</p>\n\n<p>Because the battle you will be fighting is not yours, but hers and her conscience (see point 10).</p>\n\n<p>8. Cultivate your roots.</p>\n\n<p>From the outset, let her know that nothing messes with your family. Introduce her to your rural home and make it a tradition. And for men with no good roots, you have to invent what can pass for roots. Let your kids take your identity.</p>\n\n<p>Stick to your cultural naming patterns. Give your kids your identity, so permanent that in the event of a separation, kids will know their home. And the ninja who may take over, has to work to get his kid. Most divorced men who did this, often have a softer landing. Kids like their paternal identity, especially if you do a good job in the formative years.</p>\n\n<p>9. Amerix caught some flak for advising men to have separate secret accounts, companies, and apartments that the wife is not aware of. Most argued, if marriage gets to that point, there is no marriage there bwana.</p>\n\n<p>I have also discussed about at length in my current volume of memos. But my approach has been to have a backup plan. Since most men spend their productive years paying for recurrent expenditure, and in the event, things go South, they end up broke, dejected and with no family.</p>\n\n<p>I wouldn\u2019t recommend such extreme measures, but as a man, live knowing that you are alone, in this world. If the family turns our right and supportive, knock on the wood, you are set.</p>\n\n<p>It is a safe bet. But down, the line, if kids had to pick who between the mother and the father is to go, it is you the man. With this knowledge, do your best for them, but secure something for yourself.</p>\n\n<p>Early this week was given a story of a former senior civil servant who lost his job after a regime change and the wife subjected him to a certain level of cruelty that only women whose husbands have lost jobs are capable of, but the man, took it on the chin, studying her, unbelieving what he was seeing.</p>\n\n<p>When he had enough, he took his stuff, boarded his matatu, went back to the bundus. What the slay queen wife had never known was that the man is one of the greatest landowners in the Rift Valley and the man took to farming and he is one of the greatest horticulture farmers.</p>\n\n<p>What saved the man was that he was discreet. Had he disclosed everything to the slay queen, he would have lost more than the matrimonial property and some few pieces of land in Nairobi. Make of what you may on this story.</p>\n\n<p>10. If one day, for an inexplicable reason, your wife starts to show you madharau, and this persists, hand over the regime to your step-boyfriend. Or hang around for sordid details, for sure as the sun rises in the East and sets in the West, you will learn the hard way.</p>\n\n<p>The day she starts to act funny, the day she tells you ain\u2019t sh!t, the day your authority will be compromised to a point she is above the law, pack your stuff into a huge polythene bag, leave.</p>\n\n<p>If you wait for her to kick you out, you will hate yourself for the rest of your life.</p>\n\n<p>Otherwise, all the best son. In the event things don\u2019t work, don\u2019t drive your car to hardy backside of a truck or jump off a bridge, or drink yourself to the grave.</p>\n\n<p>She won\u2019t care. Just you had a life before marriage, there can be life after marriage.</p>\n\n</article>", "canonicalUrl": "https://kenyan-post.com/2021/12/10-important-reminders-to-men-marrying-this-december-this-is-a-must-read-for-all-men/"},{"url": "https://kenyan-post.com/2021/12/i-have-moved-my-parents-out-of-the-ghetto-a-young-man-says-and-flaunts-a-lavish-house-that-he-has-built-for-his-parents-photos/", "probability": 0.8977327, "headline": "I have moved my parents out of the Ghetto \u2013 A young man says and flaunts a lavish house that he has built for his parents (PHOTOs).", "datePublished": "2021-12-08T14:13:03+03:00", "datePublishedRaw": "2021-12-08T14:13:03+03:00", "dateModified": "2021-12-08T14:13:05+03:00", "dateModifiedRaw": "2021-12-08T14:13:05+03:00", "author": "Obed", "authorsList": ["Obed"], "inLanguage": "en", "breadcrumbs": [{"name": "Home", "link": "https://kenyan-post.com/"}, {"name": "Features", "link": "https://kenyan-post.com/category/features/"}, {"name": "I have moved my parents out of the Ghetto \u2013 A young...", "link": "https://kenyan-post.com/2021/12/i-have-moved-my-parents-out-of-the-ghetto-a-young-man-says-and-flaunts-a-lavish-house-that-he-has-built-for-his-parents-photos/"}], "mainImage": "https://i0.wp.com/kenyan-post.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/259629165_428619412057238_728822679615242419_n.jpg?fit=600%2C450&ssl=1", "images": ["https://kenyan-post.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/1-1.jpg", "https://i0.wp.com/kenyan-post.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/259629165_428619412057238_728822679615242419_n.jpg?resize=600%2C450&ssl=1", "https://i0.wp.com/kenyan-post.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/259961090_428619378723908_3737261953535254622_n.jpg?resize=696%2C522&ssl=1", "https://i0.wp.com/kenyan-post.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/out-of-the-getto.png?resize=452%2C477&ssl=1", "https://i0.wp.com/kenyan-post.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/259629165_428619412057238_728822679615242419_n.jpg?fit=600%2C450&ssl=1", "https://odibets.com/widget/freebet"], "description": "Wednesday, December 8, 2021\u00a0\u2013 A middle-aged man has inspired Netizens after he flaunted a beautiful house that he has built for his parents in the outskirts of Nairobi.
