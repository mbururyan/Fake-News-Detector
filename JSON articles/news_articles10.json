Some of the things that trigger spending money include peer pressure from friends and family, current mood, or other factors that allow impulse buying, such as window shopping online. Keeping a diary is one of the best ways of tracking your spending triggers.

The strategies will also safeguard against unfair trade practices\n\nCommercial Loss\n\nIllicit goods include sub-standards of counterfeit and contraband goods smuggled into the country.

In addition to the commercial loss, there is the danger of environmental degradation affecting our efforts to contribute to climatic change policies.\n\nThree key principles make up an efficient technological anti-counterfeiting and substandard strategy. This includes the use of harmonized and standardized coding and identification system; the use of covert and overt features to authenticate products and guarantees as to the integrity of manufactures packaging throughout the whole supply chain.\n\nThe available technologies for combating substandard and counterfeit trade are categorized as optical, electronic, biological and chemical technologies.\n\nOptical technologies\n\nSome of the anti-counterfeit technologies in use are in the optical field. This technology uses light and its many properties. Holograms are the most widely used as a means of product protection among optical technologies. A hologram is a recording of laser light that allows the recording of one and two- or three-dimension images on a flat surface as a microrelief diffraction pattern.\n\nUsing holograms as a security device has become successful due to various reasons. One of them is having social appeal, coupled with difficulty and high cost and investment to replicate them. Other technologies in use include optical thin films, retro-reflective material and scrambled images.\n\nElectronics- Electronic technologies in use encompass a variety of different options. The leading security technology in this category is magnetic stripe. This one is mainly used to protect credit and bank cards. These stripes can store a considerable amount of information in coded form in magnetizable particles, readable by a contact scanner.\n\nRapid acceptance\n\nSmart cards are another technology that is rapidly growing and is receiving rapid acceptance as anti-counterfeit devices. A smart card is a plastic card with a computer chip that allows to write into or read information from the card with various degrees of security.\n\nIn some countries, credit cards and phone cards are good examples of \u201csmart\u201d 33 technology. The long-term development is to come up with a super-smart card that will contain a user interface for entering data on a keypad and a visual display. Video recording and software industries have invested heavily in finding ways to defeat counterfeiters electronically.\n\nThey have developed a system such as electronic encryption that encodes original video with a disturbance signal that confuses video recording devices during copying. This disturbance signal ensures that pirated videos are of poor quality and are not viewable.\n\nAnother electronic system involves the use of hardware keys to prevent software piracy. The key is an additional security device that attaches to the computer\u2019s serial ports or a printer and unlocks software products designed to work only with the key.\n\nOther evolving electronic technologies are mobile-based. The consumer can verify the authenticity of a product by sending a verification code using his mobile phone to the manufacturer\u2019s phone. The product comes with an attached scratch card.\n\nReal or Fake\n\nOnce the card is scratched, a one-time code is revealed and the customer sends the code as a text message to a toll-free number and receives a back message indicating whether the product is real or fake.\n\nBiotechnology-The breakthrough in biotechnology has increased the understanding of unique traits of biological proteins such as enzymes, DNA and antibodies. Identifying certain chemical structures and their capacity to make specific reactions have made biotechnology an important field in combating substandard and counterfeit trade, more so in the pharmaceuticals and drug sectors.\n\nThe leading technology in this category is the development of monoclonal antibodies that recognizes antigens or marker chemicals. The maker chemicals are added to products such as liquor and pharmaceutical in tiny concentrations. These are detected by kit with specific antibodies.\n\nBreak the Code\n\nThe advantage of this ant counterfeiting technology is that it is part of the product itself. Besides, no one can break the code since the makers\u2019 concentrations are too low to be detected through conventional methods. Also, the makers are masked with other chemicals.\n\nChemical technologies -In the chemical field, the technologies available include photochromic and thermochromic inks. These inks are applied to the product packaging and labels. When exposed to heat or light, these inks change color and revert to the original color once exposed again.\n\nOther inks are invisible to naked eyes, but there are readable by barcode scanners. These are mainly used in the pharmaceutical and fragrance industries for authenticating purposes.\n\nMicroscopic Tag\n\nPlastic tags are the other technology. This technology was initially developed for tracking and marking explosives. By incorporating this microscopic tag into bulk explosives, one can identify the origin of the explosive before and after use.\n\nThe microscope tag cannot be destroyed and is constructed of ten different colored layers. The color sequence has 34 unique codes of the tag where the total number of possible codes rages up to five billion. The tags are applied to both products and packing in various ways, such as incorporating a clear varnish.\n\nApplication of any of the above technologies depends on a number of factors like the cost of the product, the packaging and how easily customers can authenticate.", "articleBodyHtml": "<article>\n\n<p>Compliance of products imported into the country and manufactured within the country lies to several government agencies.</p>\n\n<p>The agencies include the Kenya Bureau of Standards (KEBS) controlling substandard, Anti Counterfeit Authority (ACA) controlling counterfeits and Pharmacy and Poisons Board (PPB) controlling medicines.</p>\n\n<p>Other government agencies dealing with compliance are, Pest Control Product Board (PCPB) for pesticides, KEPHIS for control of grains and pulses, Communication Authority (CAK) for communication gadgets among others.</p>\n\n<p>As the agencies strategise to combat non-compliance to protect the safety and health of consumers, there is a need to re-engineer our processes to adopt new technologies to effectively win the war against illicit trade.

These companies were registered after Ajing and Bol Mel were sanctioned by the United States.\n\n\u201cAlthough it is not illegal for these companies to receive government contracts, the fact that the contracts were in US dollars makes it likely that the funds affected the U.S. financial system.\u201d The report noted.\n\nThe size of the contracts \u2013 totaling more than $4 billion \u2013 and the level of influence and access of Ajing and Bol Mel in Juba make it likely that those involved in the contracting process knew the alleged beneficial owners of the companies.

For three years now, he has been hoping to be paid for work done for the embassy in vain.\n\nMr Benard Odongo Obunga, 48, says through his firm Benedies Construction, he had worked for the embassy of Qatar on various projects involving renovations, and duly paid in full, and on time upon completion of the projects.\n\nIn 2018 his firm was contracted for work at the embassy and the diplomatic residence.\n\n\u201cFrom my previous interactions with the embassy, I would give a quotation detailing the price and materials I needed for a project. The quotation would then be sent to their office in Doha. Once approved, a deposit of 50 per cent of the total price would be paid, and the project would start immediately. This time, the quotation was for a total of Sh8.3 million,\u201d Mr Odongo says.\n\nFollowing the approval, Mr Odongo presented five 3D demonstrations to the deputy in charge of the embassy, who approved one of the prototypes.\n\nThe agreement signed by the two parties on January 25, 2018 stipulated that the construction would be complete in 60 working days.\n\nGoing by the agreement, Benedies Construction was required to build two rooms above the ambassador\u2019s garage and a gazebo that would consist of a dining area, a lounge area, a washroom and a cloak room.\n\nAnd, the payment, according to the contract, would be done in three phases: 50 per cent first payment, 25 per cent for the second phase, and another 25 per cent for finishing.\n\nThe project\n\nAt the beginning of the project, Mr Odongo received a down payment of Sh4 million and he started the project.\n\n\u201cThe plan required that we first demolish the balcony at the top of the garage, and construct two rooms for use by domestic workers. We then constructed a fabricated metal staircase to lead up to the rooms,\u201d explains Mr Odongo.\n\nIn the course of the project, a new ambassador, Mr Jabr Bin Ali Al-Dosari, was posted to the station.\n\nMr Odongo says several variations were introduced to the project plans.\n\nRooms at the top of garage were no longer desired, the balcony was moved to the back, and metal spindles were not to be used.\n\nThat meant the contractor had to demolish the rooms and the staircase, at the embassy\u2019s cost, and wait for about two weeks for the new plan that the ambassador wanted. The desired building materials were to be imported and took almost a month.\n\nOther alterations, according to Mr Odongo, were made to the gazebo, including a kitchen. That, he argues, meant another 45-day wait for arrival of new roofing material, with little time left in the 60-day contract period.\n\nThere was another inclusion of a water tower and last-minute changes to flooring material \u2014 the initial quotation had wooden Belgian floor, but the contractor was asked to switch to a granite floor.\n\nBut since the ambassador went to Doha for three weeks, they had to wait for his approval.\n\n\u201cAt this time, it had become apparent that the finishing would be delayed, so I drafted a letter to the ambassador and his deputy asking for an extension of the completion period,\u201d says Mr Odongo.\n\n\u201cMy payment for the second phase had been duly paid by the embassy accountant through a bank transfer, and I then needed money to ensure that the finishing was done,\u201d he adds.\n\nPenalty for delays\n\nBut Mr Odongo says he was told he needed to complete the project by April 16, 2018 and that any delay of the project would attract a 0.3 per cent penalty from the total cost of the project and any accompanying damages.\n\nAlthough he expressed commitment to complete the project by the set date, Mr Odongo says the payment was never done.\n\nBroke, and the project incomplete, he says he approached Platinum Credit for a loan. In return, he gave them his Toyota Estima station wagon logbook as collateral and received a loan of Sh270,000. This saw the completion of the project, which he handed over on June 25, 2018 with the completion letter.\n\nHe reached out to his lawyers to follow up on his payment. They wrote to the embassy\u2019s legal team, Garane and Somane advocates.\n\nIn response, they said the project had delayed for 72 days, and that it had accrued penalty of Sh1, 799,280. They demanded a total of Sh1,929,391.20 from him inclusive of expenses incurred by the embassy to repair the electric fencing system the contractor was accused of damaging.\n\nMr Odongo sought the intervention of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs. In a letter addressed to the permanent secretary on October 16, 2018, the contractor details that the embassy owes him Sh2,143,000.\n\n\u201cThe Foreign Affairs legal team promised to settle the matter and assured me then that I would get my money,\u201d he says.\n\nA year later, nothing had happened and frustrated, Mr Odongo asked the ministry to give him back his file.\n\n\u201cFor three weeks, I followed up on my file until I gave up on it. It had some of my original documents. I even asked them to just give me copies of it, but was unsuccessful.\u201d\n\nIn December last year, Odongo hired another lawyer from Musyoka Shikumo and Associates Advocates. Mr Dennis Musyoka, the lawyer, says he wrote a demand letter to the embassy, asking them to clear the dues.\n\n\u201cAround February this year, the embassy\u2019s legal team reached out and scheduled a meeting with us. On the same day, they made a promise that Odongo\u2019s payment would be made soon after. We waited for a month, then sent an email to follow up. Till now, we have not received any response,\u201d says the lawyer.\n\nMediation role\n\nAn advocate from the Foreign Affairs legal team who sought anonymity confirmed that he indeed handled the issue, but explained that the ministry did all it could to help Odongo.\n\n\u201cWe have no right to compel the embassy to pay clients they contracted themselves. What we do is mediate between the conflicting parties. We have dealt with such issues before \u2014 some are successful, and some are not, because there is never a guarantee when it comes to negotiation,\u201d says the advocate.\n\nWhen Nation emailed the embassy about the matter, Mr Julius Olaha from Garane and Somane advocates responded.\n\n\u201cFirst and foremost, we are at pains to comprehend what colour of right you have in the matter considering the rules of privacy of contract \u2026\u201d the advocate responded. \u201c\u2026 We are unable to accede to your questions and request for reply for reason that the same amount to blackmail and extortion of our client for which we are ready to vehemently defend.\u201d\n\nHe continued: \u201cThe said individual was in breach of the contract the subject of the foregoing, having failed to perform his obligations under the said agreement, and that is the position of our client.\u201d\n\nHe further stated that should Nation publish the story, their client had instructed that they take appropriate legal action against the writer and attendant costs for criminal libel. \u201cWe will similarly proceed to lodge a complaint against you with the Media Council Complaints Commission,\u201d said Mr Olaha.\n\n\u201cI would have gone to court, but now I do not have the money. With Covid-19, there has been no business, and as we speak, my children have no school fees. Three of them, including my late brother\u2019s orphan, are stuck at home, and the school won\u2019t allow her back without the fees. I only want my money,\u201d cries Mr Odongo.", "articleBodyHtml": "<article>\n\n<p>A Kenyan contractor is locked in a tussle with the Qatar embassy over payment for renovations to the ambassador\u2019s residence in Nairobi. For three years now, he has been hoping to be paid for work done for the embassy in vain.</p>\n\n<p>Mr Benard Odongo Obunga, 48, says through his firm Benedies Construction, he had worked for the embassy of Qatar on various projects involving renovations, and duly paid in full, and on time upon completion of the projects.</p>\n\n<p>In 2018 his firm was contracted for work at the embassy and the diplomatic residence.</p>\n\n<p>\u201cFrom my previous interactions with the embassy, I would give a quotation detailing the price and materials I needed for a project. The quotation would then be sent to their office in Doha. Once approved, a deposit of 50 per cent of the total price would be paid, and the project would start immediately. This time, the quotation was for a total of Sh8.3 million,\u201d Mr Odongo says.</p>\n\n<p>Following the approval, Mr Odongo presented five 3D demonstrations to the deputy in charge of the embassy, who approved one of the prototypes.</p>\n\n<p>The agreement signed by the two parties on January 25, 2018 stipulated that the construction would be complete in 60 working days.</p>\n\n<p>Going by the agreement, Benedies Construction was required to build two rooms above the ambassador\u2019s garage and a gazebo that would consist of a dining area, a lounge area, a washroom and a cloak room.</p>\n\n<p>And, the payment, according to the contract, would be done in three phases: 50 per cent first payment, 25 per cent for the second phase, and another 25 per cent for finishing.</p>\n\n<p><strong>The project</strong></p>\n\n<p>At the beginning of the project, Mr Odongo received a down payment of Sh4 million and he started the project.</p>\n\n<p>\u201cThe plan required that we first demolish the balcony at the top of the garage, and construct two rooms for use by domestic workers. We then constructed a fabricated metal staircase to lead up to the rooms,\u201d explains Mr Odongo.</p>\n\n<p>In the course of the project, a new ambassador, Mr Jabr Bin Ali Al-Dosari, was posted to the station.</p>\n\n<p>Mr Odongo says several variations were introduced to the project plans.</p>\n\n<p>Rooms at the top of garage were no longer desired, the balcony was moved to the back, and metal spindles were not to be used.</p>\n\n<p>That meant the contractor had to demolish the rooms and the staircase, at the embassy\u2019s cost, and wait for about two weeks for the new plan that the ambassador wanted. The desired building materials were to be imported and took almost a month.</p>\n\n<p>Other alterations, according to Mr Odongo, were made to the gazebo, including a kitchen. That, he argues, meant another 45-day wait for arrival of new roofing material, with little time left in the 60-day contract period.</p>\n\n<p>There was another inclusion of a water tower and last-minute changes to flooring material \u2014 the initial quotation had wooden Belgian floor, but the contractor was asked to switch to a granite floor.</p>\n\n<p>But since the ambassador went to Doha for three weeks, they had to wait for his approval.</p>\n\n<p>\u201cAt this time, it had become apparent that the finishing would be delayed, so I drafted a letter to the ambassador and his deputy asking for an extension of the completion period,\u201d says Mr Odongo.</p>\n\n<p>\u201cMy payment for the second phase had been duly paid by the embassy accountant through a bank transfer, and I then needed money to ensure that the finishing was done,\u201d he adds.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Penalty for delays</strong></p>\n\n<p>But Mr Odongo says he was told he needed to complete the project by April 16, 2018 and that any delay of the project would attract a 0.3 per cent penalty from the total cost of the project and any accompanying damages.</p>\n\n<p>Although he expressed commitment to complete the project by the set date, Mr Odongo says the payment was never done.</p>\n\n<p>Broke, and the project incomplete, he says he approached Platinum Credit for a loan. In return, he gave them his Toyota Estima station wagon logbook as collateral and received a loan of Sh270,000. This saw the completion of the project, which he handed over on June 25, 2018 with the completion letter.</p>\n\n<p>He reached out to his lawyers to follow up on his payment. They wrote to the embassy\u2019s legal team, Garane and Somane advocates.</p>\n\n<p>In response, they said the project had delayed for 72 days, and that it had accrued penalty of Sh1, 799,280. They demanded a total of Sh1,929,391.20 from him inclusive of expenses incurred by the embassy to repair the electric fencing system the contractor was accused of damaging.</p>\n\n<p>Mr Odongo sought the intervention of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs. In a letter addressed to the permanent secretary on October 16, 2018, the contractor details that the embassy owes him Sh2,143,000.</p>\n\n<p>\u201cThe Foreign Affairs legal team promised to settle the matter and assured me then that I would get my money,\u201d he says.</p>\n\n<p>A year later, nothing had happened and frustrated, Mr Odongo asked the ministry to give him back his file.</p>\n\n<p>\u201cFor three weeks, I followed up on my file until I gave up on it. It had some of my original documents. I even asked them to just give me copies of it, but was unsuccessful.\u201d</p>\n\n<p>In December last year, Odongo hired another lawyer from Musyoka Shikumo and Associates Advocates. Mr Dennis Musyoka, the lawyer, says he wrote a demand letter to the embassy, asking them to clear the dues.</p>\n\n<p>\u201cAround February this year, the embassy\u2019s legal team reached out and scheduled a meeting with us. On the same day, they made a promise that Odongo\u2019s payment would be made soon after. We waited for a month, then sent an email to follow up. Till now, we have not received any response,\u201d says the lawyer.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Mediation role</strong></p>\n\n<p>An advocate from the Foreign Affairs legal team who sought anonymity confirmed that he indeed handled the issue, but explained that the ministry did all it could to help Odongo.</p>\n\n<p>\u201cWe have no right to compel the embassy to pay clients they contracted themselves. What we do is mediate between the conflicting parties. We have dealt with such issues before \u2014 some are successful, and some are not, because there is never a guarantee when it comes to negotiation,\u201d says the advocate.</p>\n\n<p>When Nation emailed the embassy about the matter, Mr Julius Olaha from Garane and Somane advocates responded.</p>\n\n<p>\u201cFirst and foremost, we are at pains to comprehend what colour of right you have in the matter considering the rules of privacy of contract \u2026\u201d the advocate responded. \u201c\u2026 We are unable to accede to your questions and request for reply for reason that the same amount to blackmail and extortion of our client for which we are ready to vehemently defend.\u201d</p>\n\n<p>He continued: \u201cThe said individual was in breach of the contract the subject of the foregoing, having failed to perform his obligations under the said agreement, and that is the position of our client.\u201d</p>\n\n<p>He further stated that should Nation publish the story, their client had instructed that they take appropriate legal action against the writer and attendant costs for criminal libel. \u201cWe will similarly proceed to lodge a complaint against you with the Media Council Complaints Commission,\u201d said Mr Olaha.</p>\n\n<p>\u201cI would have gone to court, but now I do not have the money. With Covid-19, there has been no business, and as we speak, my children have no school fees. Three of them, including my late brother\u2019s orphan, are stuck at home, and the school won\u2019t allow her back without the fees.

You need to carefully analyze the audited financial statements going back the last 5 years to verify the facts that are laid out in this letter. If it were a private limited company, then there would be no need for this. However, it isn\u2019t. The management in charge of this public limited company has gone rogue and needs to stop.\n\nBefore we go into details, we would like to state why we are doing this. First, we love the company as former employees, we and our families have been forced to pay for the sins of a leader who has gone rogue. Over 40 staff members have been made redundant this year and many more have been forced to leave due to a toxic work environment. The Group CEO blames everyone for the failures of the business, especially employees, instead of taking responsibility (as a real leader should). In this, the crusade against employees, the company will have saved a mere KES 100 million annually, in staff expenses while it bleeds a whooping KES 2.7 BILLION shillings annually in interest expense (which is growing fast, because of the compounding nature of interest). Secondly, we are doing this because we have no other choice, we did not have an avenue for whistleblowing in the business that is independent and objective. If this was possible, we would have brought it to the board\u2019s attention earlier. So, we have chosen to take accountability of the firm to higher authorities than the Group CEO, who is a feared demi-god in the organization. Therefore, we invite you dear reader to review the contents of this letter and make your own objective conclusions.\n\nYour review may lead you to the conclusion that there is more than an 80% chance that the asset values of the Company\u2019s real estate portfolio are inflated. If you are aware with the Evergrande Crisis in China, then you will be able to see the similarities between that real estate company and Centum Real Estate\u2019s business model.\n\nIn your detailed assessment, we hope you see that the Company is operating on a \u2018spend now and think later\u2019 model where all money is spent in advance of income being realized. Additionally, you will also discover (only if you do a detailed review) the intricate web of debt that company\u2019s management has secured over the same period of time that currently stands at a staggering KES 34 billion shillings from 3 major banks and the commercial paper\u2019s investors (over 120 retail investors).\n\nThe collateral structure of the debt is completely convoluted and intertwined, such that if all the debt investors were to call in their collateral, the company would go into immediate insolvency. And a fun fact, is that, all the debt is set to mature in the same financial year, FY24/FY25. Such a coincidence in public funds mismanagement.\n\nIn your review, you will also discover that the Company\u2019s investment model is not appropriate for a publicly-traded company where a large number of its shares are held by small scale investors. You will discover that the Group CEO has created a well-guarded eco-system of selfish gain as the ultimate beneficiary that has exposed 33,000 small investors in Centum to complete erosion of shareholder value. The consistent decline the share price of the company at the securities exchange reflects the poor business model that the company has been running on. The market cap of the company at the NSE of KES 12 BILLION is actually a true reflection of the company\u2019s actual net asset value as opposed to the book NAV indicated in the company\u2019s financials of KES 60 BILLION.\n\nAs you do your review, take note of the aggressive valuation of the (sur)real estate portfolio, that has allowed management to incur debt beyond the Company\u2019s sustainable ability to repay. While the company has audited financial statements, the auditors have been complicit in this scheme in prior years, by choosing to earn fees and not keep the management honest. However, in the last two years, things have gotten dire and the auditors have been implicitly complicit.\n\nThe web of deceit is so complex that if you do a keen review, you will discover that the distribution of dividends and bonuses (from which the Group CEO personal net worth has grown more than ( now KES 2 billion shillings) was funded through borrowing in some cases and in all cases was based on paper income driven by unrealized gains hence the reference to the \u2018credit card\u2019 spending of the company.\n\nAs whistleblowers, it is our hope that as shareholders, media firms and as a regulator, you will do your own independent assessment of the company and come to the same conclusion as we have. Centum, the listed entity, is on the edge of bankruptcy, and the Group CEO is the culprit who has run the company to the ground. His management team has been complicit due to their inability to speak truth to power and have also benefited in the process, through bonuses. However, the madness must stop, and the company needs to get back to the path of sustainable performance and it can only happen if there is a radical change in leadership and business strategy.\n\nThe additional conclusion, you may draw, is that company should make the required accounting write-offs of asset values and settle the majority of its debt because currently the firm is not in a position to honour its capital commitments and has been surviving on the luck-driven land sales of Vipingo Development and customer deposits that have been mobilized through the sale of residential units.\n\nTHE HOUSE OF CARDS\n\nThere is a series \u2013 House of Cards, it is an American political thriller on the story of Frank Underwood (acted by Kevin Spacey). Frank, a Democrat, rises from being South Carolina\u2019s 5 th congressional district representative to the president of United States. Very similar story to the rise of an intern to the Group CEO. Much like House of Cards, the Centum story has revolved around themes of ruthless pragmatism when dealing with employees, board manipulation and monetary gain.\n\nAt the height of the Company\u2019s success in 2015, the share price was KES 70 and since then, the share price has spiralled down to KES 15. One of the basic principles people learn in finance is that the market is never wrong. The market is an aggregation of investor expectations, and the share price is largely a reflection of investors sentiment about the future earnings prospect of the company.\n\nThe decline in Centum\u2019s share price is a reflection of the business\u2019s illiquid real estate assets after the exit of the cash-rich private equity assets (the majority of which are legacy assets from the government). The company has exited its legacy private equity businesses that have unlocked lumpy and once-off cash events, little of which have trickled to the shareholders.\n\nPIRATE EQUITY\n\nThe business model of building businesses of (to) scale has run its course within the company given that the private equity business does not have a pipeline of realizable assets.\n\nTo put it into perspective, between the 2014 and 2020, the private equity business recorded exit proceeds of a staggering KES 40 billion (UAP, Almasi, AON, KWAL, Platinum Credit etc). (Verify this from FY19 investor presentation). A little assignment for you dear reader, go and research how much of that money went back to the shareholders pocket versus management bonuses versus how much went to businesses that have been written off. The story will lay itself bare. PS its less than 4 billion shillings.\n\nNow, we invite you to look at the current private equity assets, Sidian Bank, Isuzu, NAS, Longhorn Publishers, Greenblade Growers and Akiira, Amu Power and Zohari. All these assets have a combined book value of KES 20 billion. Note that inside of those valuations are the power assets of Akiira and Amu power with a total of value of KES 4 billion which are white elephants and have no cash generative value to the business.\n\nThat is KES 4 billion is shareholders money that will never be recovered.\n\nConclusion: The actual value of the PE business is KES 16 billion with no new capital deployment in sight. The recent media announcement that Centum is purchasing 3 companies was publicity stunt. DO YOUR OWN INVESTIGATION.\n\nIn summary, the PE business has exited KES 40 billion of assets and is now remaining with KES 16 billion of realizable cash assets. On paper nothing looks wrong, but the subtle strategy has been asset stripping the PE business over a period of time because there has not been a purchase or redeployment of any of those asset proceeds back into the PE business. Most of the proceeds have gone to the real estate portfolio, failed green opportunities such as King Beverage, Greenblade Growers, Akiira, Amu power and management bonuses, which have costed the business over KES 15 Billion shillings in the last 6 years.\n\n3 years into the current strategy period, the PE side of the business has not been able to secure any acquisitions and are unlikely to secure any acquisitions because there is no cash to acquire the assets.\n\nBefore diving into the real estate strategy, let us lay out the debt structure of the business 90% being in real estate:\n\nCentum Investment Plc Bank overdraft fully drawn: KES 4 billion\n\nTwo Rivers Development Bank Loan: KES 7 billion\nTwo Rivers Development Commercial Papers: KES 4 billion\nTwo Rivers Mall Bank Loan: KES 9 billion The total debt in the Centum group is KES 34 billion all these debts have a coincidental maturity year(s) of between FY 24 and FY 25. THIS IS THE REAL HOLE IN THE BUSINESS. The banks at this point should be getting jittery. In order to [a] secure all this debt and [b] maintain all the debt covenants and put a \u2018show\u2019 that all is well, management has adopted aggressive accounting policies in valuation of the real estate investments. The shocking thing about the business, is that it does not have any immediate cash coming into the business. A quick example for the 2019 reporting cycle, the valuers engaged to value Vipingo land submitted a report that the senior management disagreed with. The values were thereafter \u2018pursuaded\u2019 to revise the valuation upwards. Another example in the 2020 reporting cycle, the valuers of Two Rivers Development were also \u2018persuaded\u2019 to increase the valuation of TRDL\u2019s development rights. A development which has been booking valuation losses in 2018 and 2019, was revalued upwards in a pandemic year! We believe the auditors raised a concern with valuation methodologies, it is sad they were not able to get to the bottom of it and the board was managed.You see the difficulty with the unrealized gains of real estate, is that they go to the revaluation reserves in the balance sheet. The movement from the revaluation reserves to cash, will depend on the actual selling of those assets. So, if the selling price of those assets is within market prices, it will be easy for management to sell. However, if the selling price of those assets is way above market prices, then management will not be able to sell. The company will therefore be stuck with revaluation reserves in its balance sheet and zero income or cash coming into the business. Then they will not be able to pay the debt because of zero cash. We would also want to call on the Kenya Revenue Authority to investigate the tax payable due the aggressive land valuation. The Group CEO has hidden from the board and KRA that Centum has a current tax exposure of KES 3 BILLION shillings due the revaluation gains it has been booking and has not remitted a single shilling to KRA of that amount. Fancy accounting tactics have kept this exposure hidden. An example of the aggressive valuations is as follows:\n\nVipingo Development Land was bought at circa KES 200,000 per acre in 2016. In the last 5 years, the valuation of the land has increased 10 TIMES. (Highest appreciating land in Kenya!). Now the argument typically, is that the company has invested in infrastructure and secured approvals to make the place a mixed-used development. But all infrastructure on the land, including the desalination plant, comes to a total of KES 1 billion. Even for argument\u2019s sake, let\u2019s increase that figure to KES 3 billion, and say KES 3 billion has been invested in the land (not a chance in hell), if you divide that by the total number of acres originally bought (10,000 acres), you will get a figure close to KES 300,000 per acre. That would mean that out of prudence, perhaps the land should be worth KES 500,000 and even for good measure double that amount to KES 1 million. Now, how on earth is the Vipingo land now worth a staggering KES 2 million per acre? What sort of justification can be practically given for holding land so expensively? In fact, for the reader to know the hubris that is in this aggressive valuation, the bank discounted the value of the land KES 5 billion and hence why they advance an equity release loan of such an amount and charged the entire 10,000 acres of land.\n\nTo add further insult to injury, the last 3 major transactions carried out at Vipingo Development for sale of over 2,000 acres have been below the book value of KES 2 million per acre, meaning a loss on disposal (proving the overvaluation of the land).\n\nTwo Rivers Development is the straw that will break the Centum\u2019s back. We will not dwell on the circular referencing behind driving valuation of land up to secure bank and commercial paper debt, that is ancient history. The company is where it is, with a total debt of KES 10 BILLION and additional liabilities of KES 2 BILLION. If you take the total sellable land at two rivers (50 acres) and divide with the liabilities the company has (KES 12 billion \u2013 if you forgot) then you will find that value per acre in order for the company to meet its liabilities is about KES 240 million. This is the floor valuation to be able to remedy this problem.\n\nBreaking down the debt further: The commercial papers are expensive (total of KES 4 billion); the average pricing is c. 20% per annum. The bank debt (KES 7 billion) is also not cheap either, at c. 12% per annum, meaning that on average two rivers incurs KES 1.5 billion shillings of interest expense as it. That is equivalent to 6 acres per year, taken out by interest. In 3 years\u2019 time when the debt matures, the interest plus principal repayment would have eaten away all the sellable land. Shareholders will NOT receive a single shilling from Two Rivers. At best maybe the mall, but remember a bank already has a claim on that of KES 9 BILLION.\n\nPearl Marina: For a litmus test, try buy land adjacent to the development. It will be one third of the book value that it is being held at. The only decent thing about this development is that it does not have debt, but again, management is in the advanced stages of securing a similar debt structure to Vipingo (equity release), and at some point, you just wonder, when will this madness stop? At this point, pause and picture how much debt management has taken to enrich themselves, after stripping the private equity business.\n\nOn the sale of residential units. We will invite you to review the business cases for all the project, the average profit margin per project is 10-15%, now even assume that the land will be additional profit (because it is owned by Centum RE), it will increase the total project profit margin to between 20-25%. The two key project risks are market risk (how quickly management can sell) and construction risk (how quickly management can build). The selling side is the trickiest and more importantly collecting the sales revenue. Even the best performing and completely built projects have 60% of sales revenue collected 6 months after completion; meaning that management reasonably needs at least 2 years after construction to collect sales revenue.\n\nThe catch is here, that the profit or shareholder return is 20-25%, to collect this final portion, it will come at least one year after all projects are completed. So, what is the issue here? If the company\u2019s real estate assets were not financed by debt, then one would have the luxury of collecting the sale revenue without any hurry. But that is not the case. The chocking nature of interest expense has applied pressure on management to collect sales revenue from the project, pay bank debt and pay contractors to deliver the project. EVERGRANDE CRISIS, BUT IN KENYA.\n\nIt gets a more complicated dear reader, stay with us. There are two levels of debt in real estate, debt at the corporate entity level, for example, Two Rivers and Vipingo as shown in the chart above. And there is debt at the project level because as per the project business cases, they are financed by portions of equity, debt and sales deposits. Examples of projects are Awali, Palm Ridge, Riverbank, Loft etc. Now, since the corporate entities have debt, the projects have been struggling to secure debt and have mainly been financed by sales deposits. The challenge comes in when customer deposits are used to balance between paying corporate entity level and continuing construction. It is by some form of luck that the balancing act has not gone south. In fact, on several occasions, residential deposit money has been used to pay bank and commercial bank debt interest at Two Rivers. It is a very dicey game management is playing.\n\nIn summary, the company employed a private equity strategy in the real estate portfolio. But instead of asset stripping as in the private equity portfolio, it triggered a different set of actions:\n\nOverstated gains in the value of land which then supported unfunded staff bonus payments and unfunded dividend payouts.\nThe overstated gains also encouraged excessive borrowing with some of the funds\n\nThe conclusion is that the real estate \u2018pie\u2019 has already been eaten. Any additional funds spent on real estate developments are not likely to create any meaningful value. Real estate has now become an avenue through which funds can be illegally extracted from the business as will be captured in the allegations below, which we will invite you dear reader to investigate.\n\nINSTANCES OF PUBLIC MONIES FRAUD THAT WE INVITE THE CMA, EACC, DCI, AND PARLIAMENT TO INVESTIGATE THAT ARE HIGHLY CREDIBLE\n\nThere is secrecy around TRDL and CICL\u2019s dealings with Funscape Dubai Inc (the JV partner) and Funscape K Ltd (the \u201coperators\u201d). Funscape Dubai has never contributed monetary capital to the venture but is considered 50% shareholders. Any contributions by them through sweat equity have never been valued. Attempts by staff to question the special status enjoyed by Sanjay and Funscape are usually shut down by the Group CEO.\n\nThe contractor ROKO construction who has failed to deliver the projects given to him, Cascadia and those in Uganda, was brought in by the Group CEO. The contractor submitted bids that were 30% below the board approved business cases, a fact that the group CEO has gloated on several occasions that he was able to secure on behalf of the business. The contractor has cost the real estate business in excess of KES 2 billion shillings in losses, cost variations, project delays and protests from subcontractors. Cascadia and Uganda projects are 5 months behind schedule.\nTo replace the above Roko Contractor, the Group CEO again pushed a contractor, Sanjad Limited, who constructed projects in Nanyuki, owned by him and is constructing the Group CEO\u2019s house in Nairobi. Again, against the warning of the employees regarding the ability of the newly appointed contractor to deliver Cascadia and other awarded projects in Uganda, the Group CEO pushed on with it. Again, verify these allegations. We are certain that you\u2019ll find it to be true.\n\nWe did this anonymously because James is has gone rogue and to great lengths to silence voices of truth and reason in the organization and we hope action will be taken.", "articleBodyHtml": "<article>\n\n<p>This letter lays out the sham of leadership and management that has been going on at Centum Investment Company. You need to carefully analyze the audited financial statements going back the last 5 years to verify the facts that are laid out in this letter. If it were a private limited company, then there would be no need for this. However, it isn\u2019t. The management in charge of this public limited company has gone rogue and needs to stop.</p>\n\n<p>Before we go into details, we would like to state why we are doing this. First, we love the company as former employees, we and our families have been forced to pay for the sins of a leader who has gone rogue. Over 40 staff members have been made redundant this year and many more have been forced to leave due to a toxic work environment. The Group CEO blames everyone for the failures of the business, especially employees, instead of taking responsibility (as a real leader should). In this, the crusade against employees, the company will have saved a mere KES 100 million annually, in staff expenses while it bleeds a whooping KES 2.7 BILLION shillings annually in interest expense (which is growing fast, because of the compounding nature of interest). Secondly, we are doing this because we have no other choice, we did not have an avenue for whistleblowing in the business that is independent and objective. If this was possible, we would have brought it to the board\u2019s attention earlier. So, we have chosen to take accountability of the firm to higher authorities than the Group CEO, who is a feared demi-god in the organization. Therefore, we invite you dear reader to review the contents of this letter and make your own objective conclusions.</p>\n\n<p>Your review may lead you to the conclusion that there is more than an 80% chance that the asset values of the Company\u2019s real estate portfolio are inflated. If you are aware with the Evergrande Crisis in China, then you will be able to see the similarities between that real estate company and Centum Real Estate\u2019s business model.</p>\n\n<p>In your detailed assessment, we hope you see that the Company is operating on a \u2018spend now and think later\u2019 model where all money is spent in advance of income being realized. Additionally, you will also discover (only if you do a detailed review) the intricate web of debt that company\u2019s management has secured over the same period of time that currently stands at a staggering KES 34 billion shillings from 3 major banks and the commercial paper\u2019s investors (over 120 retail investors).</p>\n\n<p>The collateral structure of the debt is completely convoluted and intertwined, such that if all the debt investors were to call in their collateral, the company would go into immediate insolvency. And a fun fact, is that, all the debt is set to mature in the same financial year, FY24/FY25. Such a coincidence in public funds mismanagement.</p>\n\n<p>In your review, you will also discover that the Company\u2019s investment model is not appropriate for a publicly-traded company where a large number of its shares are held by small scale investors. You will discover that the Group CEO has created a well-guarded eco-system of selfish gain as the ultimate beneficiary that has exposed 33,000 small investors in Centum to complete erosion of shareholder value. The consistent decline the share price of the company at the securities exchange reflects the poor business model that the company has been running on.

Even the best performing and completely built projects have 60% of sales revenue collected 6 months after completion; meaning that management reasonably needs at least 2 years after construction to collect sales revenue.</p>\n\n<p>The catch is here, that the profit or shareholder return is 20-25%, to collect this final portion, it will come at least one year after all projects are completed. So, what is the issue here? If the company\u2019s real estate assets were not financed by debt, then one would have the luxury of collecting the sale revenue without any hurry. But that is not the case. The chocking nature of interest expense has applied pressure on management to collect sales revenue from the project, pay bank debt and pay contractors to deliver the project.\u00a0<strong>EVERGRANDE CRISIS, BUT IN KENYA.\u00a0\u00a0</strong></p>\n\n<p>It gets a more complicated dear reader, stay with us. There are two levels of debt in real estate, debt at the corporate entity level, for example, Two Rivers and Vipingo as shown in the chart above. And there is debt at the project level because as per the project business cases, they are financed by portions of equity, debt and sales deposits. Examples of projects are Awali, Palm Ridge, Riverbank, Loft etc. Now, since the corporate entities have debt, the projects have been struggling to secure debt and have mainly been financed by sales deposits. The challenge comes in when customer deposits are used to balance between paying corporate entity level and continuing construction. It is by some form of luck that the balancing act has not gone south. In fact, on several occasions, residential deposit money has been used to pay bank and commercial bank debt interest at Two Rivers. It is a very dicey game management is playing.</p>\n\n<p>In summary, <a href=\"https://kenyanmarketintelligence.com/kirubis-death-lifts-lid-on-his-links-with-notorious-tax-haven/\">the company</a> employed a private equity strategy in the real estate portfolio. But instead of asset stripping as in the private equity portfolio, it triggered a different set of actions:</p>\n\n<ol><li>Overstated gains in the value of land which then supported unfunded staff bonus payments and unfunded dividend payouts.</li><li>The overstated gains also encouraged excessive borrowing with some of the funds</li></ol>\n\n<p><strong>The conclusion is that the real estate \u2018pie\u2019 has already been eaten. Any additional funds spent on real estate developments are not likely to create any meaningful value. Real estate has now become an avenue through which funds can be illegally extracted from the business as will be captured in the allegations below, which we will invite you dear reader to investigate.\u00a0\u00a0</strong></p>\n\n<p><strong><u>INSTANCES OF PUBLIC MONIES FRAUD THAT WE INVITE THE CMA, EACC, DCI, AND PARLIAMENT TO INVESTIGATE THAT ARE HIGHLY CREDIBLE\u00a0</u></strong></p>\n\n<ol><li>There is secrecy around TRDL and CICL\u2019s dealings with Funscape Dubai Inc (the JV partner) and Funscape K Ltd (the \u201coperators\u201d). Funscape Dubai has never contributed monetary capital to the venture but is considered 50% shareholders. Any contributions by them through sweat equity have never been valued. Attempts by staff to question the special status enjoyed by Sanjay and Funscape are usually shut down by the Group CEO.</li></ol>\n\n<ol><li>The contractor ROKO construction who has failed to deliver the projects given to him, Cascadia and those in Uganda, was brought in by the Group CEO. The contractor submitted bids that were 30% below the board approved business cases, a fact that the group CEO has gloated on several occasions that he was able to secure on behalf of the business. The contractor has cost the real estate business in excess of KES 2 billion shillings in losses, cost variations, project delays and protests from subcontractors. Cascadia and Uganda projects are 5 months behind schedule.</li><li>To replace the above Roko Contractor, the Group CEO again pushed a contractor, Sanjad Limited, who constructed projects in Nanyuki, owned by him and is constructing the Group CEO\u2019s house in Nairobi. Again, against the warning of the employees regarding the ability of the newly appointed contractor to deliver Cascadia and other awarded projects in Uganda, the Group CEO pushed on with it. Again, verify these allegations.

It turned out that Omwenga and Obure were business associates in the scamming world before a deal we\u2019ve sore leading to the s hooting and murder of Omwenga. Bodo shot the victim in which the state believes was on Obure\u2019s instructions making him a prime suspect in the case.\n\nCar dealer Kevin Omwenga was apparently in disagreement with his alleged killers over a Sh100 million deal.\n\nApparently, the deceased was unhappy with his perceived business partner and murder suspect, Chris Obure.\n\nOmwenga is said to have sealed the deal but did not receive his cut in cash. Instead, Obure purchased two cars and paid rent for his Galana Suites apartment to a tune of Sh1 million.\n\nInvestigations and documentary evidence showed that although Obure had denied having any business or a strong relationship with the deceased, strong evidence indicated that Omwenga\u2019s apartment and vehicles he claimed to own were fully paid for by Global Jet International a company that Obure has leadership authority in.\n\nThe vehicles; a Porsche Panamera was bought for Sh8 million and later a Range Rover which was involved in an accident for Sh12 million.\n\nFrom the deal, Omwenga got Sh20 million instead of some Sh60 million.\n\nOmwenga wanted his share, which was about Sh60 million, but he got two cars worth Sh20 million instead, a full year of house rent and a yard to open his business for selling cars.\n\nChris Obure is Nairobi\u2019s resident gold scammer. Just four years ago, he conned a Venezuelan lawyer Sh200 million in a botched gold deal. Deals worth less than Sh100 million are for his juniors. Like Kevin Omwenga, his friend who was killed by his bodyguard using Obure\u2019s gun.\n\nThis was one of the highly publicized murder cases in the recent times after that of Monica Kimani where the murder suspects Jowie Irungu and Jacque Maribe spent time in jail they\u2019re also out on bail.\n\nOmwenga was killed over a fake gold deal that he was to seal in Dubai that weekend, investigations have shown.\n\nObure and Bodo were arrested on August 21, 2020, after Omwenga was murdered in his house at Galana Suites in Kilimani, Nairobi.\n\nThey denied the charge and were granted bail of Sh2 million and Sh500,000 respectively by Justice Jessie Lessit. The court directed them to deposit two sureties of the same amounts.\n\nThe court barred the accused from contacting any of Omwenga\u2019s relatives or a prosecution witness.\n\nThey were also ordered to surrender their travel documents to the court and file affidavits declaring their respective places of residence.\n\nJustice Lesiit further barred the accused from owning or holding a firearm during the pendency of the case and said any gun in their custody should be surrendered to police.\n\nThe prosecution had opposed the bail application, fearing the accused would interfere with the investigations and intimidate witnesses.\n\nThe court also heard that interference by the accused persons would significantly harm the pursuit of justice in the matter.\n\nThe investigating officer Bashir Boya said investigations had established Ouko accompanied Kevin to his house for dinner on the day he was killed.\n\nAfter dinner, Ouko excused himself to go home but before he could leave, they went to the bedroom. Soon after, a loud sound similar to a gunshot was heard in the bedroom.\n\n\u201cOuko hurriedly came out of the bedroom and said he wanted to rush somewhere but was restrained by Kevin\u2019s brother Wycliffe who was then in the kitchen cooking.\n\n\u201cAnother guest went to the bedroom and found Kevin lying on the floor, holding his chest,\u201d Boya told court.\n\nKevin was rushed to Nairobi Women\u2019s Hospital in Hurlingham where he was pronounced dead upon arrival.\n\nOuko allegedly went back to Glo-jet offices at Senteu Plaza to hide the gun in an attempt to conceal the murder, investigators said.\n\nIt was only after Ouko was arrested the following day that he led detectives to Senteu Plaza where a firearm, loaded with 13 rounds of ammunition, was recovered. The weapon belonged to Obure.\n\nWith the publicity from the Omwenga\u2019s murder, Obure\u2019s company Glo Jet International came to the surface and a center of attention for both the investigators and the public.\n\nLocated in Senteu Plaza Lenana/Galana Road,Glo Jet occupies the 1st floor of the building and is which is next to Mr Omwenga\u2019s residence at Galana Suites.\n\nAlmost entire staff including cleaners wear cabin uniforms in a deceptive move to give the company a serious face of an aviation company which in real life is non existent. Investigators however believe the office and firm is only used by Obure as a decoy for his many murky businesses including fake gold that has dominated accusations against him.\n\nIts also in the same office that accounts of the murder indicate that the victim had spent better part of the day with his shooter and where the gun was kept and returned.\n\nOne of those who\u2019ve been to Obure\u2019s office while talking to Kenyan Market Intelligence describes it as an \u2018opulent yet intimidating\u2019 place he describes how Obure\u2019s bodyguard Ouko is always at the door frisking and keeping watch at everyone entering to talk \u2018business\u2019 with the boss. \u201cHe talks big and calls names, that office is also used to intimidate and threaten those who don\u2019t go by his rules.\u201d The source said.\n\nIt\u2019s in this office that is manned by cold face bodyguards in suits all the way from the gate that deals are sealed, scam victims robbed and intimidation of those who push or threaten to expose him get threatened. Often, he doesn\u2019t hesitate to draw out his gun. The scammer has a history of violence and thrives in impunity.\n\nThe murder case is still ongoing with the suspects out on bond however, the mystery surrounding the murder of car dealer Kevin Omwenga may not be unravelled soon following the mysterious death of a key witness in his murder case.\n\nKevin\u2019s younger brother Wycliffe Omwenga was a key witness in the murder case as he was in the house when his late brother was shot and saw Bodo leave the house. Wycliffe\u2019s body was found in his house in Riruta, Nairobi, in July with \u201cfew bloodstains.\u201d\n\nWycliffe was yet to testify on his brother\u2019s murder case. Investigations on his death circumstances have never been made public. Without his testimony as a key witness, there are possibilities of Obure and his core accuser walking free. In most criminal cases, doing away with witnesses had been a favorite way of criminals getting away with crimes.\n\nIn the midst of all the circus, Obure after taking a break from the public limelight is yet again back flaunting his wealth and hitting social scenes like he used to.\n\nUsing his all (CH-JET) plate customized cars, Obure is often seen moving around in expensive fleet of cars.\n\nThose familiar with his operations say he uses this to boost his portfolio while cutting deals so as to be seen as a man of might. The targeted victims are left intimidated and convinced of a clean deal as he clears doubts of scamming with his \u2018wealth\u2019 and opulence.\n\nThose familiar with the intelligence are silently calling him \u2018protected snitch\u2019 given his wide web connections with authorities and a clear reason why he\u2019s barely arrested or prosecuted despite many scam deals done. In most cases, it is the small people in the wash wash web who\u2019re arrested in choreographed raids by police, they\u2019re often sacrificed by their seniors to give media headlines of police working yet it\u2019s known the kingpins bribe the cops to look away when they\u2019re scamming and offer them protection.\n\nQuestions have been raised over Glo Jet\u2019s acquisition of an ambulance. Using the same CH-JET identical plate, many are asking why a shadowy aviation firm has been given a pass to operate. \u201cWhy would gold scammers (dabbling in many other interesting ventures) register and operate an ambulance that has a right of way 24/7.\u201d A concerned Citizen tweeted.\n\nWhat\u2019s interesting is the ambulance being associated with Jet Spa another shadowy company owned by Obure but as a front to cover up the real dealings.\n\nWhat\u2019s even more interesting is the fact that the alleged MD of Jet Spa Ms. Maria DeSantis is a fake figure. The photo used by the scammers in the fooling website is actually downloaded from a German website and incidentally, the real person is not Maria DeSantis but Stefania Grisenti, the spa manager at Centoundici Spa located in Italy.\n\nIt is not a coincidence that the fraud scheme roped in a white figure in the picture as owner of a frontier company for the Obure\u2019s empire, they think deeper, will let you know more why.\n\nOn Glo Jet website is where the real drama exists, almost the entire board comprises of whites predominantly and tactfully.\n\nIt\u2019s even funny that the same person Maria they put as Jet Spa MD, they\u2019ve listed her as a Glo Jet director but under a different name, Hellen Gabi. A red flag. Because people don\u2019t do due diligence, they find it easy to get away.\n\nAccording to internet archives unearthed by Kenyan Market Intelligence, Obure and his father were initially listed as board members wuth the father as the group chairman before the murder case, they removed their photos and bio from the website in a clever way to delink from the company while in real Obure is the rightful owner and architect of the enterprise now hidden under PROXIES.\n\nThey\u2019re cunningly using white figures to put an impression that it\u2019s an international company, also there\u2019s a perception that white people are honest and not involved in scamming, in short, the white people in the portfolio gives a scamming company a clean template and easily wins the trust of unsuspecting scamming targets.\n\nWe\u2019ve done our own search and none of the listed board members exist in real life with the scribed names. We\u2019ve concluded, the photos attached on the baiting sites are all downloaded from random internet sources. Everything is as fake as it comes.\n\nOne might ask why the much efforts to cloth the scamming companies. Well simple, scammers want to be seen to be doing legitimate businesses to keep away roving eyes and avoid raising suspicions from authorities and targeted victims and what a better way to do it like Obure with an opulent office, illusory aviation firm which comes with well done websites to back it all up and give it all a sense of legitimacy. Even conmen, think deeper.\n\nFake gold scammers often use cargo delays narratives in their ploy, more often is the \u2018package\u2019 held by authorities awaiting custom clearance in which the scamming target is asked for more money to \u2018clear the goods\u2019. This is an empty deal used to buy time as they mince out the targeted before disappearing. An aviation company like Glo Jet would come in handy for similarly fraudulent businessmen who want shortcuts to get gold only to end up getting scammed.\n\nObure is a notorious face with the police stations and court rooms since to afford his high end lifestyle, some sucker has to be separated from with his millions. Victims are always men. The scamming cartel operates from Kilimani, Nairobi\u2019s capital of drugs, sex dens, gun runners, kidnappings, money laundering, \u2018wash-wash\u2019 and murders.\n\nObure\u2019s victims, mostly foreigners, sue him, but shortly, active death threats see them gassing towards the airport fleeing back to Brazil, Russia, Hong Kong, Malaysia, Australia. Obure cuts deals, pays coppers protection fees. The millions are rarely recovered, no one gets jailed.\n\nOfficers familiar with the cartel explained that gold scamming is an exclusive crime club: small time beginners pay Obure \u2018scamming fees\u2019. Obure in turn pays protection fee to entrenched coppers in case of arrests.\n\nIndeed, the Kilimani cartel comprise dapperly dressed crooks using offices with plush carpets and secretaries in mini-skirts, high heels, plunging cleavages. It is here that the \u2018Mark\u2019 as scammers call their victims, is taken for their financial throats to be slit.\n\nWith his modest education, Chris Obure began from the lower end of the food chain as mtu wa mkono for Paul Kobia, the scammer in-chief. Obure took \u2018Marks\u2019 to meetings with government officials, giving dirty deals a clean hand. He would later take the victims to Kobia\u2019s office, a seven bedroom house in Riverside Drive, Nairobi where he would arrange Kobia\u2019s pocket handkerchief.\n\nObure worked for Paul Kobia for more than 20 years, then became captain of his own scam ship after falling out\n\nObure would show Kobia photos as proof of meetings with mandarins in government before ensuring the \u2018Marks\u2019 didn\u2019t get into Kobia\u2019s office with phones or any recording devices.\n\nKobia would receive phone calls in which \u2018Yes your Excellency!\u2019 featured prominently to impress the \u2018Marks.\u2019 Obure would be entrusted with clearing their traffic enroute to their hotel. But there is thinning or little traffic at 10pm in Nairobi! The \u2018Marks\u2019 would shortly be crying in the toilet.\n\nObure worked for Kobia for more than 20 years, rising to Chief Strategist and Director of Business Development at Kobia\u2019s Great Lakes Group of Companies. Then he became the captain of his own scam ship after falling out with Kobia.\n\nIt so happened that Obure came across e-mails in which Kobia was demanding Sh20 million from Hong Kong based businessman, Dennis Schmelzenbach. According to court documents, Schmelzenbach was to pay an additional Sh20 million as \u2018lift fees\u2019 for 300kg of gold worth Sh500 million.\n\nPresident Kabila jetted to Nairobi and pressed retired President Mwai Kibaki to help him wrestle his gold from Paul Kobia\n\nObure sent an e-mail warning him not to send any more money to Kobia who was shortly arrested but late released on Sh500,000 bond.\n\nDeath threats saw Obure fleeing to South Africa. That was in 2011 when Kobia was accused by Congolese President Joseph Kabila of stealing his 400kg of gold worth Sh8 billion.\n\nKabila jetted in person to Nairobi where he pressed retired President Mwai Kibaki to help him wrestle the gold from Kobia.\n\nShortly, police and KRA officers led by Joseph Cheptarus, KRA Assistant Commissioner for Investigations and Enforcement, raided Kobia\u2019s warehouse in JKIA\u2026 but found no gold. A day later, Cheptarus was shot dead outside his house at 1am in Nairobi\u2019s South C estate that February. Four gunmen had abducted the guards and worn their uniform. Then waited for Cheptarus, pumped four slugs into his body.\n\nSo how do gold scams work? Well, it starts with a sucker falling for a pitch over the Internet\n\nKobia denied stealing Kabila\u2019s gold and instead said he got it from the gold mine of a Congolese named Etienne. Kobia\u2019s office was then a seven-bedroom house in Nairobi\u2019s Riverside Drive.\n\nSo how do gold scams work?\n\nWell, it starts with a sucker falling for a pitch over the Internet. The sucker agrees to come to Kenya on a tourist visa to see the gold \u2018live-live.\u2019 Meetings are in lavishly furnished offices, apartments or five-star hotels. To make suckers feel important, scammers hire police as bodyguards complete with outriders for clearing traffic from the airport.\n\nThey meet government officials. Lawyers draw contracts. The suckers are then driven in limos to a warehouse inside JKIA where they pick one bar of gold at random for independent testing.\n\nThen the scam begins with the suckers paying for the gold. But there is a small problem: The plane the suckers used would be intercepted at JKIA runway unless tax to clear the gold is paid. The suckers would pay. But then officials from the Ministry of Mining would intercept the gold demanding payment of duty and fictitious taxes. The suckers would pay and \u2018lift fees\u2019 as well.\n\nEventually the gold would be released only for it to turn into gold coloured metal upon arrival, say in Dubai. The suckers would return to file a police report for being conned. But they will be arrested for working in Kenya using tourist visas which is illegal!\n\nThe sucker will pay more to be released on bond, but getting his visa back will mean forking out more quid then death threats will see the sucker coiling his tail towards the airport before another sucker comes calling for his throat to be slit. They are always men!\n\nBesides gold, the scammers also deal in expensive rose oil used in perfumes, selling impounded cars from Mombasa port and minerals like diamonds and mercury. Then there are fake tenders and witchcraft-to bewitch those who conned you to return the money\u2026but after paying, the mganga and his accomplices disappear and you are left looking for another mganga to get the crooked mganga!", "articleBodyHtml": "<article>\n\n<p>An ambulance attached to Glo Jet International a company owned by renowned fake gold scammer and a murder suspect <a href=\"https://biznakenya.com/chris-obure/\">Chris Obure</a>.</p>\n\n<p>In August 2020, Obure together with his bodyguard Robert Bodo were charged with the murder of Kevin Omwenga.

The court directed them to deposit two sureties of the same amounts.</p>\n\n<p>The court barred the accused from contacting any of Omwenga\u2019s relatives or a prosecution witness.</p>\n\n<p>They were also ordered to surrender their travel documents to the court and file affidavits declaring their respective places of residence.</p>\n\n<p>Justice Lesiit further barred the accused from owning or holding a firearm during the pendency of the case and said any gun in their custody should be surrendered to police.</p>\n\n<p>The prosecution had opposed the bail application, fearing the accused would interfere with the investigations and intimidate witnesses.</p>\n\n<p>The court also heard that interference by the accused persons would significantly harm the pursuit of justice in the matter.</p>\n\n<p>The investigating officer Bashir Boya said investigations had established Ouko accompanied Kevin to his house for dinner on the day he was killed.</p>\n\n<p>After dinner, Ouko excused himself to go home but before he could leave, they went to the bedroom.

Then he became the captain of his own scam ship after falling out with Kobia.</p>\n\n<p>It so happened that Obure came across e-mails in which Kobia was demanding Sh20 million from Hong Kong based businessman, Dennis Schmelzenbach. According to court documents, Schmelzenbach was to pay an additional Sh20 million as \u2018lift fees\u2019 for 300kg of gold worth Sh500 million.</p>\n\n<blockquote><p><strong><em>President Kabila jetted to Nairobi and pressed retired President Mwai Kibaki to help him wrestle his gold from Paul Kobia\u00a0</em></strong></p></blockquote>\n\n<figure><img src=\"https://undercoverafrica.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/Paul-Kobia-Undercoverafrica.com-gold-scammer-1024x1024.jpg\" alt=\"\"><figcaption><strong>Shadowy don:\u00a0</strong>Paul Kobia operated from a seven-bedroom house in Nairobi\u2019s Riverside Drive.\u00a0</figcaption></figure>\n\n<p>Obure\u00a0sent an e-mail warning him not to send any more money to Kobia who was shortly arrested but late released on Sh500,000 bond.</p>\n\n<p>Death threats saw Obure fleeing to South Africa.

The sucker agrees to come to Kenya on a tourist visa to see the gold \u2018live-live.\u2019 Meetings are in lavishly furnished offices, apartments or five-star hotels. To make suckers feel important, scammers hire police as bodyguards complete with outriders for clearing traffic from the airport.</p>\n\n<p>They meet government officials. Lawyers draw contracts. The suckers are then driven in limos to a warehouse inside JKIA where they pick one bar of gold at random for independent testing.</p>\n\n<p>Then the scam begins with the suckers paying for the gold. But there is a small problem: The plane the suckers used would be intercepted at JKIA runway unless tax to clear the gold is paid. The suckers would pay. But then officials from the Ministry of Mining would intercept the gold demanding payment of duty and fictitious taxes. The suckers would pay and \u2018lift fees\u2019 as well.</p>\n\n<figure><img src=\"https://undercoverafrica.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/pix3-1024x683.jpg\" alt=\"\"><figcaption><strong>Officer down:</strong>\u00a0Joseph Cheptarus was shot dead outside his house in Nairobi\u2019s South C estate.

They are always men!</p>\n\n<p>Besides gold, the scammers also deal in expensive rose oil used in perfumes, selling impounded cars from Mombasa port and minerals like diamonds and mercury.

They were to supply and equip hospitals countrywide with more than 95 high-tech machines to help manage diseases such as cancer and diabetes.\n\nFor some reason, the cost of the equipment cost counties Ksh. 200 million annually which has been deducted from their annual expected remittances by Central Government, which totals Ksh. 9.4 Billion annually.\n\nThis was a 100%+ bump-up from the initial Ksh. 4.5 Billion Contracted annually.\n\nGovernors were either too busy stealing county funds, shagging anything in a skirt or committing murder to pay any attention to central Governments taking away their county funds through the Ministry of Health, and then transferring these funds to pockets of individuals.\n\nAnecdotally, in the run-up to the 2013 General election, the Kenyatta family had reached out to the Ndegwa family for financial assistance, which they actually received, with the quid pro quo that Uhuru Kenyatta (once elected) would automatically hire James Macharia to be the Minister for Health.\n\nMacharia was by then a long-time CEO for NIC Bank and a close confidante of the Ndegwa family. His insinuation into the Health Ministry was ostensibly to channel as many of these deals to the family.\n\nFor those not in the know, this relationship was formally consummated in the recent buyout of NIC Bank by the Kenyatta\u2019s Commercial Bank of Africa (CBA) to become the behemoth, NCBA, whose assets now make it the 3rd largest bank in Kenya.\n\nTo illustrate just how convoluted the minds of the Kenyatta\u2019s and their allies really are, in one of his last acts as Finance Minister, the disgraced Henry Rotich gazetted a waiver of more than Ksh. 350 million in share transfer taxes on the merger deal.\n\nWhat makes this decision a concoction of the most depraved mind is the fact that there was no public interest to be served by exempting the merged NIC Group PLC (NIC) and Commercial Bank of Africa (CBA), which are private profit-making entities, from paying the share transfer tax dues.\n\nThe Kenyatta inner circle of hoodlums, most of whom preen with pride at being called corrupt and ruthless, meet regularly at Galileo Lounge, from whence they show the rest of Kenya the proverbial middle finger while sipping their expensive whiskeys, looking down on us for our poverty which they earnestly believe is an apparent byproduct of our lack of brains.\n\nBut, it is at the Health Ministry where the Kenyatta\u2019s and their cronies have found safe haven, to execute the most elaborate finance heists and scams, while inadvertently placing the very lives of the millions of Kenyans in mortal danger.\n\nMobile clinics dumped at the NYS yard in Mombasa\n\nWe all remember the use of the so-called mobile containers importation scam by Uhuru Kenyatta\u2019s sister, to bring in fully kitted, ready-to-go medical containers to serve as hospitals in some of the most remote areas of the country.\n\nNot only were the container prices grossly over-inflated, but they had also been paid for in advance and on a cash basis to the tune of Billions of shillings in what later came to be known as the Mafya House scandal.\n\nWithout shame, the Kenyatta\u2019s dumped the containers somewhere in Mombasa where they have rotted away unutilized for more than 5 years.\n\nThe trigger man at the Health Ministry at the time was PS Nicholas Muraguri who facilitated this deal, and who, when the scrutiny intensified was quickly spirited off to the Lands Ministry, where he continues to personally serve the Kenyatta kakistocracy by overseeing their mind-boggling and obscenely large landholdings.\n\nBut that is not where this mad caper ends, at the Galileo Lounge, a plan was concocted to have one more large bite of the medical containers cherry.\n\nKenyatta loyalists had been eyeing the Sports Fund for a while, incapable of ignoring the mounting contributions to its kitty from the top betting companies Sportpesa and Betin.\n\nThe Sports Fund is a product of the Sports Act 2013, which had always been set up to fund sports activities in the country, including but not limited to, the National Olympics and other teams in international assignments.\n\nUnable to understand how something as insignificant as Sports could be allowed an allocation of funds in the billions, a plan was concocted by the Galileo Lounge group to amend the Sports Act 2013 to allow them to tap into this fund.\n\nSo despite the presence of court orders and open opposition to the plan, the Galileo group in 2018 arranged with MPs to quietly expand the wording of the Act, enlarging the Sports Fund to become the Sports, Art, and Social Development Fund.\n\nBy expanding the Fund, Uhuru Kenyatta appointed the now 93-year-old Moody Awori to chair its board, alongside the PSs of Education, Arts, Health, National Treasury, and Sports.\n\nThe only Sports person left in the board is Gen (Rtd) Jackson Tuwei of Athletics Kenya, a dinosaur with most of his best days behind him than ahead of him, and who appointment to the Fund board cemented Uhuru Kenyatta\u2019s continued militarization of Government with the preference of military men in key positions, men who live by the credo of \u201cyes sir\u201d and following orders without question.\n\nThis would ordinarily not be a problem, had the Kenyan military always handled itself with professionalism, we all remember the shocking images of soldiers looting from inside Westgate in 2013, the massacre of KDF bases in El Adde in 2016 and a repeat of the same at Kulbiyow in 2017 despite documented evidence that KDF already had intelligence of enemy activity nearby, beforehand.\n\nAll these senior military officers that Uhuru has been placing in senior civilian roles come from a system that has shown a high level of incompetence in the execution of its military roles\u2026 go figure!\n\nBut, we digress\u2026\n\nThe very first act by Moody Awori and his board was the release of Ksh. 1 billion to the company associated with Uhuru Kenyatta\u2019s sister (again) in the procurement and delivery of the medical containers.\n\nThe pretext here was that these containers needed to be cleared urgently and commissioned, and the money was released under the social development arm of the now-expanded Act.\n\nWe further posit that the containers have never been moved from where they were dumped, despite the release of the Ksh. 1 billion.\n\nMeanwhile, Sports continues to languish in dire financial straits, these Kenyatta\u2019s are truly an accursed lot and a bane on Kenya.\n\nGalileo Lounge owner Richard Ngatia is also the high priest of medical supplies in Kenya through the Governmental Kenya Medical Supplies Authority (KEMSA) which is a state corporation under the Ministry of Health established under the KEMSA Act 2013 and \u201cwhich provides reliable, affordable and quality health products and supply chain solutions to improve healthcare in Kenya\u2026\u201d\n\nThe greatest cause of distress during this COVID-19 pandemic in Kenya revolves around the well-known fact that we lack the medical capacity to handle a full-blown infection.\n\nFirst World countries\u2019 capacity has been outstripped and doctors are having to choose whom to give emergency medical care, and whom to let die.\n\nNgatia had been ready for the coronavirus outbreak since January, by using his access to high-level international intelligence that is available to the Kenyan Presidency, he, therefore, imported a lot of the testing kits and PPEs that would be critical, before the lockdown of airspace around the World.\n\nCurrently, Kenya has 10s of thousands of testing kits in the country, with two-thirds having been donated by Chinese Jack Ma and others, but these donations were taken over by Ngatia, to be resupplied to private hospitals.\n\nCurrently, the Nairobi Hospital is charging Ksh. 10,000 per test for the COVID-19 and similarly too, most of the top private facilities in the country.\n\nMeanwhile, there appear to be only 2 or 3 public testing centers in the country for the masses.\n\nThose people rounded through contact tracing or arbitrary arrests by the Government are quarantined at schools at a cost of Ksh.. 2,000 per person per day.\n\nHowever, Ngatia through KEMSA has in excess of 5,000 critical care beds which they are releasing to counties that are willing to pay cash for them.\n\nWe recently saw Mombasa County Government procure such beds through a Private-public partnership.\n\nOn the frontlines, doctors and other critical staff have not received any personal protectives equipment (PPEs) from KEMSA despite constant claims that this equipment is readily available and clear evidence that they have been donated to the Government through KEMSA.\n\nSo we continue to wonder, why hasn\u2019t the Ministry of Health ensured that these beds and PPEs arrive at all county hospitals in Kenya in anticipation of the spike in infections and hospitalizations?\n\nMeantime, the Government continues to allocate billions to vanity projects, Ksh. 200 million to the First Lady\u2019s office, Ksh. 120 million to the Deputy First Lady\u2019s office, Ksh. 72 million to the former PM\u2019s office.\n\nThe Kenyan first lady would fundraise hundreds of millions of shillings annually for her legacy \u201cbeyond zero\u201d program in a thinly veiled attempt to hoodwink the Republic that she is plugging the hole created by the incompetence of her oft-inebriated husband and his clique of fiendish friends.\n\nOne of the most heart-rending descriptions of the neglect of our healthcare system was the recent death of renowned Swahili media guru Prof. Ken Walibora.\n\nThe Daily Nation reported that \u201c the x-ray and CT Scan showed extensive damage to his head, so doctors resolved he needed to be placed in intensive care\u2026. But unfortunately, all the 22 beds in the KNH main ICU were occupied\u2026\n\nThe main national referral hospital in Kenya has only 22 ICU beds, while Richard Ngatia is hawking 5,000 emergency beds through KEMSA during this peak period of COVID-19, taking advantage of the crisis to charge premium prices for them.\n\nWhere does the Uhuru Kenyatta Government draw a line in the sand, separating their rapacious pursuit of money for his close personal friends and family, from his sworn duty to protect and defend the lives of his countrymen?\n\nIn the run-up to the 2013 elections, among the Kikuyu community, there was the generally accepted clincher that Uhuru Kenyatta\u2019s rise to the Presidency was the best thing for Kenya, for the simple reason that Uhuru and his family did not need to steal from the National coffers, that his folks had done all the stealing on his behalf.\n\nThese Kikuyu hillbillies and assholes today shout that Uhuru was a big mistake and that the better solution is now William Ruto, the 2nd face of the same coin of KANU lunacy.

They were to supply and equip hospitals countrywide with more than 95 high-tech machines to help manage diseases such as cancer and diabetes.</p>\n\n<p>For some reason, the cost of the equipment cost counties Ksh. 200 million annually which has been deducted from their annual expected remittances by Central Government, which totals Ksh. 9.4 Billion annually.</p>\n\n<p>This was a 100%+ bump-up from the initial Ksh. 4.5 Billion Contracted annually.</p>\n\n<p>Governors were either too busy stealing county funds, shagging anything in a skirt or committing murder to pay any attention to central Governments taking away their county funds through the Ministry of Health, and then transferring these funds to pockets of individuals.</p>\n\n<p>Anecdotally, in the run-up to the 2013 General election, the Kenyatta family had reached out to the Ndegwa family for financial assistance, which they actually received, with the quid pro quo that Uhuru Kenyatta (once elected) would automatically hire James Macharia to be the Minister for Health.</p>\n\n<figure><img src=\"https://kenyandigest.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/Top-shareholders-in-the-NIC-CBA-merger.png\" alt=\"Top shareholders in the NIC-CBA merger\">\n<figcaption><p><strong>Top shareholders in the NIC-CBA merger</strong></p></figcaption></figure>\n\n<p>Macharia was by then a long-time CEO for NIC Bank and a close confidante of the Ndegwa family. His insinuation into the Health Ministry was ostensibly to channel as many of these deals to the family.</p>\n\n<p>For those not in the know, this relationship was formally consummated in the recent buyout of NIC Bank by the Kenyatta\u2019s Commercial Bank of Africa (CBA) to become the behemoth, NCBA, whose assets now make it the 3rd largest bank in Kenya.</p>\n\n<p>To illustrate just how convoluted the minds of the Kenyatta\u2019s and their allies really are, in one of his last acts as Finance Minister, the disgraced Henry Rotich gazetted a waiver of more than Ksh. 350 million in share transfer taxes on the merger deal.</p>\n\n<p>What makes this decision a concoction of the most depraved mind is the fact that there was no public interest to be served by exempting the merged NIC Group PLC (NIC) and Commercial Bank of Africa (CBA), which are private profit-making entities, from paying the share transfer tax dues.</p>\n\n<p>The Kenyatta inner circle of hoodlums, most of whom preen with pride at being called corrupt and ruthless, meet regularly at Galileo Lounge, from whence they show the rest of Kenya the proverbial middle finger while sipping their expensive whiskeys, looking down on us for our poverty which they earnestly believe is an apparent byproduct of our lack of brains.</p>\n\n<p>But, it is at the Health Ministry where the Kenyatta\u2019s and their cronies have found safe haven, to execute the most elaborate finance heists and scams, while inadvertently placing the very lives of the millions of Kenyans in mortal danger.</p>\n\n<figure><img

clinics dumped at the NYS yard in Mombasa</strong></p>\n\n<p>We all remember the use of the so-called mobile containers importation scam by Uhuru Kenyatta\u2019s sister, to bring in fully kitted, ready-to-go medical containers to serve as hospitals in some of the most remote areas of the country.</p>\n\n<p>Not only were the container prices grossly over-inflated, but they had also been paid for in advance and on a cash basis to the tune of Billions of shillings in what later came to be known as the Mafya House scandal.</p>\n\n<p>Without shame, the Kenyatta\u2019s dumped the containers somewhere in Mombasa where they have rotted away unutilized for more than 5 years.</p>\n\n<p>The trigger man at the Health Ministry at the time was PS Nicholas Muraguri who facilitated this deal, and who, when the scrutiny intensified was quickly spirited off to the Lands Ministry, where he continues to personally serve the Kenyatta kakistocracy by overseeing their mind-boggling and obscenely large landholdings.</p>\n\n<p>But that is not where this mad caper ends, at the Galileo Lounge, a plan was concocted to have one more large bite of the medical containers cherry.</p>\n\n<p>Kenyatta loyalists had been eyeing the Sports Fund for a while, incapable of ignoring the mounting contributions to its kitty from the top betting companies Sportpesa and Betin.</p>\n\n<figure><img

geezers?</strong></p></figcaption></figure>\n\n<p>The Sports Fund is a product of the Sports Act 2013, which had always been set up to fund sports activities in the country, including but not limited to, the National Olympics and other teams in international assignments.</p>\n\n<p>Unable to understand how something as insignificant as Sports could be allowed an allocation of funds in the billions, a plan was concocted by the Galileo Lounge group to amend the Sports Act 2013 to allow them to tap into this fund.</p>\n\n<p>So despite the presence of court orders and open opposition to the plan, the Galileo group in 2018 arranged with MPs to quietly expand the wording of the Act, enlarging the Sports Fund to become the Sports, Art, and Social Development Fund.</p>\n\n<p>By expanding the Fund, Uhuru Kenyatta appointed the now 93-year-old Moody Awori to chair its board, alongside the PSs of Education, Arts, Health, National Treasury, and Sports.</p>\n\n<p>The only Sports person left in the board is Gen (Rtd) Jackson Tuwei of Athletics Kenya, a dinosaur with most of his best days behind him than ahead of him, and who appointment to the Fund board cemented Uhuru Kenyatta\u2019s continued militarization of Government with the preference of military men in key positions, men who live by the credo of \u201cyes sir\u201d and following orders without question.</p>\n\n<figure><img

shocking images of soldiers looting from inside Westgate in 2013, the massacre of KDF bases in El Adde in 2016 and a repeat of the same at Kulbiyow in 2017 despite documented evidence that KDF already had intelligence of enemy activity nearby, beforehand.</p>\n\n<p>All these senior military officers that Uhuru has been placing in senior civilian roles come from a system that has shown a high level of incompetence in the execution of its military roles\u2026 go figure!</p>\n\n<p><strong>But, we digress\u2026</strong></p>\n\n<p>The very first act by Moody Awori and his board was the release of Ksh. 1 billion to the company associated with Uhuru Kenyatta\u2019s sister (again) in the procurement and delivery of the medical containers.</p>\n\n<p>The pretext here was that these containers needed to be cleared urgently and commissioned, and the money was released under the social development arm of the now-expanded Act.</p>\n\n<p>We further posit that the containers have never been moved from where they were dumped, despite the release of the Ksh. 1 billion.</p>\n\n<p>Meanwhile, Sports continues to languish in dire financial straits, these Kenyatta\u2019s are truly an accursed lot and a bane on Kenya.</p>\n\n<p>Galileo Lounge owner Richard Ngatia is also the high priest of medical supplies in Kenya through the Governmental Kenya Medical Supplies Authority (KEMSA) which is a state corporation under the Ministry of Health established under the KEMSA Act 2013 and \u201cwhich provides reliable, affordable and quality health products and supply chain solutions to improve healthcare in Kenya\u2026\u201d</p>\n\n<p>The greatest cause of distress during this COVID-19 pandemic in Kenya revolves around the well-known fact that we lack the medical capacity to handle a full-blown infection.</p>\n\n<figure><img src=\"https://kenyandigest.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/COVID-Truth.jpg\" alt=\"Real Kenyan sentiments on their Government\">\n<p><figcaption><strong>Real

care, and whom to let die.</p>\n\n<p>Ngatia had been ready for the coronavirus outbreak since January, by using his access to high-level international intelligence that is available to the Kenyan Presidency, he, therefore, imported a lot of the testing kits and PPEs that would be critical, before the lockdown of airspace around the World.</p>\n\n<p>Currently, Kenya has 10s of thousands of testing kits in the country, with two-thirds having been donated by Chinese Jack Ma and others, but these donations were taken over by Ngatia, to be resupplied to private hospitals.</p>\n\n<figure><img src=\"https://kenyandigest.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/KenyaAssistance.png\" alt=\"Kenya has received massive assistance but it never reaches the frontlines\"></figure>\n\n<p>Currently, the Nairobi Hospital is charging Ksh. 10,000 per test for the COVID-19 and similarly too, most of the top private facilities in the country.</p>\n\n<p>Meanwhile, there appear to be only 2 or 3 public testing centers in the country for the masses.</p>\n\n<p>Those people rounded through contact tracing or arbitrary arrests by the Government are quarantined at schools at a cost of Ksh.. 2,000 per person per day.</p>\n\n<p>However, Ngatia through KEMSA has in excess of 5,000 critical care beds which they are releasing to counties that are willing to pay cash for them.</p>\n\n<p>We recently saw Mombasa County Government procure such beds through a Private-public partnership.</p>\n\n<figure><img

this equipment is readily available and clear evidence that they have been donated to the Government through KEMSA.</p>\n\n<p>So we continue to wonder, why hasn\u2019t the Ministry of Health ensured that these beds and PPEs arrive at all county hospitals in Kenya in anticipation of the spike in infections and hospitalizations?</p>\n\n<p>Meantime, the Government continues to allocate billions to vanity projects, Ksh. 200 million to the First Lady\u2019s office, Ksh. 120 million to the Deputy First Lady\u2019s office, Ksh. 72 million to the former PM\u2019s office.</p>\n\n<figure><img

Sensing danger, the firm quickly appointed Co-op Bank to be their trustee but the bank politely declined and did not disclose their reservations.\n\nThe Four other banks that they approached also failed to take up the opportunity. This brings us to some of the observations we made a few months ago giving details why Cytonn is a risky investment as follows; Cytonn Investment Management PLC pauses as one of the independent investment management firm in Kenya which is doing well locally and in the region but beyond the what the eyes could see lies a company in deep problems.\n\nThe recent regulations in real estate industry did not leave Cytonn\u2019s regulated clients in its Money Markets Fund and Pensions products. Cytonn\u2019s Investor Relations page also opted to conceal the 2017 and 2016 financial years\u2019 statements. And to make matters worse, they are yet to publish financial statements for FY 2018.\n\nWhile there are risks associated with every company but it\u2019s a lot more for Cytonn\u2019s clients. Most of the risk in Cytonn is centered in its real estate development arm. Cytonn\u2019s regulated clients in the Cytonn Money Market Fund and Cytonn Pensions products are equally exposed to loss as Cytonn\u2019s High Yield Solutions LLP clients.\n\nOn the other hand, it\u2019s evident that StateBank of Mauritius (SBM) Kenya Limited and Taaleri Oyj also face losses to varying extents. Cytonn recently concealed its historical financial statements signifying there is more than meets the eye in the company. They are not releasing the new ones either. Months back, Cytonn was found deep into one of the dangerous PR gimmicks simply because they have failed to sell in this hard market, but in order to create an impression that things are going well, they had to resort to such cheap PR where one person would win nearly in every giveaways.\n\nExperts warn that the markets have not adequately understood the risk inherent in investing with Cytonn and urge caution. \u201cWhile the Cytonn brand represents a youthful freshness not seen in the staid financial services industry to date; we recommend that market participants remain cautious.\u201d A source told KMI.\n\nFor the companies in real estate, it\u2019s no longer rosy for them. CIC is already selling 712 acres of land and exiting the property development business. Britam PLC on the other hand is exiting the real estate development business with plans to auction properties in Upper Hill and beyond to avoid losses across its portfolio. Also, a second developer in Athi River\u2019s Sunset Boulevard estate is in the red as I&M Bank plans to auction 204 units to recover a KSh 2 Billion debt. The banking industry reports that Non Performing Loans (NPLs) to real estate developers amount to KSh 43 Billion.\n\nCytonn has bet boldly on real estate. Since the firm offers clients, through Cytonn High Yield Solutions LLP, rates of up to 18% p.a based on loans made to its own projects. After admitting that CHYS rates are based on loan pricing, Cytonn cannot pose as a better real estate risk manager than banking and insurance firms which have more established track records. The falling Cytonn PLC is now acting as a bank thus offering loans to its own real estate projects at 18% p.a. This in real sense is not logical at all. CIC Britam PLC and I&M Bank PLC are selling properties where Cytonn also has property- the Nairobi satellite towns in Kiambu and Kajiado counties.\n\nAccording to the notes in Cytonn\u2019s 2017 financial statements- Cytonn has properties in Kiambu County \u2013 The Alma, Taraji Heights, RiverRun Estates- where the greatest possibility for loss is. Banks have already moved to auction properties in these areas, fearing that lowering prices would lead to write offs and losses. Since Cytonn\u2019s residential properties are also located in these areas and have the same fundamentals; then its properties are also going to lose value.\n\nDon\u2019t forget that through the corporate guarantee given by Cytonn PLC, these properties underwrite the KSh 10.5 Billion in loans owed to Cytonn High Yield Solutions LLP clients Since Cytonn owes KSh 40 for every KSh 1 invested, even a small decline in property values (such as the 2.6% decline reported by Hass Consult in Q1 2019); would mean that Cytonn High Yield Solutions LLP clients are already losing money. Because properties sold at auction often sell for lower than their market value, Cytonn High Yield Solutions LLP clients are further exposed to loss.\n\nWe find that in the present situation, selling Cytonn PLC\u2019s properties would not yield enough money to compensate all CHYS clients. The properties are not as valuable. Through Cytonn Asset Managers Limited (CAML), Cytonn\u2019s regulated clients- in the Cytonn Money Markets Fund (CMMF) and Cytonn Pensions space- are equally at risk of loss for the following reasons: One, CAML clients are still invested in the same manager (Cytonn PLC) that\u2019s already extremely indebted to CHYS clients. Two, the strategy and manager are still the same meaning regulation has not changed how risky the funds are.\n\nLastly, Cytonn\u2019s Money Market Fund claims an annual return of 10.7% p.a. Since a portion of its fund is likely invested in treasury bonds and bills earning a maximum rate of 10% p.a; the increase in performance is because a portion of CMMF funds is invested in CHYS at 18% and consequently, Cytonn\u2019s declining property portfolio.\n\nAccording to the Global Credit Ratings company rating of Cytonn for FY 2018, Investment Managers at Cytonn\u2019s B/BB ratings are judged to have a poor management and control environment Ratings Downgrade just like Chase Bank Kenya Limited went under receivership shortly after GCR issued a corporate downgrade.\n\nCytonn PLC\u2019s current GCR rating implies an 83% chance of bankruptcy in 3-5 years. This is a sign that all pensions clients should avoid the company due to its riskiness. Cytonn PLC\u2019s stakeholders in Cytonn High Yield Solutions LLP clients bear the greatest risk of loss. First, they are owed sh5.8 Billion as interest.\n\nSecondly, the amounts reported on Cytonn\u2019s books don\u2019t tally with the amounts reported in Cytonn PLC\u2019s financials as debts owed to them. Lastly, while CHYS clients have a separate board of directors, they do not have representation in Cytonn PLC\u2019s main board of directors where the decisions to invest their money are made. SBM Kenya Limited, which has loaned Cytonn Sh650 million against The Alma is equally at risk.\n\nThe property owned by The Alma is under covenants protecting the interests of TT-Africa, the project\u2019s first lender. SBM is not protected either as some of its units have been pledged as collateral to high value CHYS clients. In terms of ranking Taaleri takes lead followed by SBM then CHYS clients comes last. Taaleri Oyj has the least to lose.\n\nWhile their investment in Cytonn has come in the form of property loans at 21% p.a (Cytonn\u2019s 2017 financial statements); their status as the first lender with board representation protects them from loss. It is common for international private equity firms such as Taaleri to insist on restrictive covenants that protect their investment from loss. Such covenants would give them priority in the sale of assets such as Cytonn\u2019s land.\n\nTaaleri also owns the option to purchase 20% of Cytonn which is more ofPR stunt than bonafide transaction as Cytonn\u2019s reports of the transaction provided no consideration. It is uncommon for private equity transactions to close without reporting transaction values. Reporting the transaction value would also value Cytonn PLC, Cytonn Asset Managers Limited (CAML) clients are also at risk of loss.\n\nGiven last year\u2019s GCR downgrade and the delayed release and concealment of the 2018 and 2017 financial statements respectively; the management culture and risk management processes are still the same.\n\nYou all remember that Chase Bank Kenya Ltd\u2019s receivership was preceded by a GCR ratings downgrade, withdrawal. While there is certainly more hope for Cytonn at this point, it is unwise to recommend CAML\u2019s services as a pensions manager due to the riskiness of Cytonn PLC, the parent company.\n\nPensions trustees and consultants should evaluate Cytonn PLC\u2019s financial statements which are currently concealed before deciding whether to engage the services of CAML. We went on to disclose that Cytonn has a questionable reputation financially. Cytonn PLC\u2019s current GCR rating alone implies an 83% chance of bankruptcy in 3-5 years.\n\nExperts have been questioning how in a country where many developers have run at huge losses, some facing auctioneers and others sell their properties at a throw-away prices, it is still possible for Cytonn to genuinely promise a 55% capital appreciation in some of the 10 multibillion projects.\n\nCytonn PLC should not lie to local and foreign institutional investors, high-net-worth-individuals and struggling Kenyans that they are doing well. It\u2019s only through cheap PR stunts that Cytonn PLC have paused as a company which takes calculated risks after extensive research. Not even the use of latest financial model will save them from crumbling.\n\nIt\u2019s worth recalling that Cytonn\u2019s housing projects have been accused of flouting the urban planning and environment regulations among other impunities. The Situ Village which sits in a very serene environment in Karen is subject of an appeal to the National Environment Tribunal \u2013 by Karen & Langata District Association- and it is said Cytonn can construct anything except a boundary wall. In February 2019, they stripped a section of the riparian area of the sensitive Mbagathi River.\n\nCytonn fraudulently acquired an area of around 7,500 square metres. The Water Resources Authority has visited and 254News trust that Cytonn will be brought to book soon over this. In fact it\u2019s a matter of time. KMI also learnt that Karen area has the highest concentration of private schools where most of prospective investors want to settle. It\u2019s on this reason that Cytonn PLC employed impunity to acquire pieces of land in riparian areas since acquiring such appears cheaper in the long run compared to other high-end areas without such riparians.\n\nAlso the crazy monies from Finnish equity funds and financial services firm Taaleri that manages a Sh658.5 billion kitty and provides funding to Cytonn and other Africa\u2019s real estate makes them operate with impunity. If only the markets in Kenya and the region adequately understood the risk inherent in investing with Cytonn, nobody would stand at a loss. There has been slow growth in Kenya\u2019s real estate over the past few years. This situation has worsen following the current tough economic situation in the country, many layoffs, constrained credit access to both buyers and developers, uncertainties in building approval laws, and a weakening purchasing power among potential buyers.\n\nA recent data by Kenya Bankers Association (KBA) seen by KMI indicates that there has been very minimal growth of 2.78% in the sector. While releasing the banking lobby\u2019s house price index at the middle of this year, Jared Osoro, KBA\u2019s head of research and policy observed that there was a price decline during the first quarter of 2019 while indicating that \u201cThe sustenance of a general trend observed since the second quarter of 2018 is seen as tentative, and could be a pointer to a depressed market if sustained,\u2019\u2019 Real estate has been one of the country\u2019s fastest growing sectors in the last 15 years, with returns from property outpacing equities and securities.\n\nThe sector has, however, suffered slow growth in sales and rental prices recently due to a huge stock of unsold units and oversupply of properties thus surpassing the demand.\n\nKMI has learnt that it\u2019s this depressed Kenyan housing market that has forced Cytonn PLC to offer huge promotions in blogs, mainstream media and social media to entice unsuspecting buyers with freebies and lower down payments. Some of these PR stunts involves cutting down the prices by a percentage thus angering earlier buyers who paid higher prices; an image of a well-managed company and photos that hoodwinks potential buyers.\n\nAccording to data by central bank of Kenya (CBK), real estate recorded the highest growth in non-performing loans in the first quarter of the year, this has resulted to the rise of the asset seizures by many lenders. A loan is considered non-performing if it remains unserviced for more than three months so they say.\n\nCBK reported that non-performing loans (NPLs) in the sector rose by Sh6.1 billion (15.8%) in April-June to Sh44.4 billion compared to the previous quarter as property developers outpaced manufacturers (11.7%) and traders (7.3%) in growth of default on loans.\n\nCytonn continues to get funds directly from individuals and institutional investors as opposed to going through banking sector intermediaries irrespective of the frustrations these group of investors are left to go through in this tough economy. Cytonn has subjected many of its customers to untold suffering. They do a lot of PR only for their unsuspecting buyers and investors to lose their properties to creditors.\n\nThere are so many repossessed homes, properties that are being sold off cheaply across the country. We understand that there is general financial difficulties but a bigger percentage has been fueled by cheap PR stunts, promotions. If your monies are not looted from state coffers but borrowed from banks or earned by the sweat of your brows then if you have to buy property in Kenya, Cytonn is not your ideal seller because sooner or later, your sweat may be watered down as you die slowly through depression.\n\nIt is the same PR that forces real estate firms to look for environmentally unfriendly locations in the guise of \u2019leafy suburbs\u2019 to build your \u2018dream home\u2019. Cytonn is deeply in this rat race, flouting environmental and urban laws with impunity and bribing the authorities not to demolish such structures.\n\nThe Situ Village, a Cytonn development, which sits in a very serene environment in Karen is subject of an appeal to the National Environment Tribunal\u2013 by Karen and Langata District Association- and it is said Cytonn can construct anything except a boundary wall. In February, they stripped a section of the riparian area of the sensitive Mbagathi River.\n\nCytonn fraudulently acquired an area of around 7,500 square metres. The Water Resources Authority has visited and 254News trust that Cytonn will be brought to book soon over this. In fact it\u2019s a matter of time. Furthermore, 254News can authoritavely confirm that CIC, Britam PLC and I&M Bank PLC are already selling properties in Nairobi\u2019s satellite towns of Kiambu and Kajiado counties.\n\nAnd according to the reports inside the Cytonn\u2019s already concealed 2017 financial year statements, Cytonn has properties in Kiambu County namely The Alma, Taraji Heights, RiverRun Estates- where the greatest possibility for loss is. Banks have already moved to auction properties in these areas, fearing that lowering prices would lead to write offs and losses.\n\nThis auctioning craze can be seen in one of the biggest mortgage lender, Housing Finance Company of Kenya (HF) which has put Ksh2 billion clients\u2019 properties to auction, sending distress in the real estate sector. Majority of the 54 properties that are on sale in Nairobi and its environs are standalone houses and apartments whose reserve prices range from Sh3.4 million to Sh300 million, the Business Daily reports. HF was also recently sued and the clients won, HF is therefore being sked to pay Sh1.2 billion as compensation for the person whose house was auctioned illegally in 2002.\n\nThis Kenya real estate market is not lucrative as Cytonn would like you believe. Over the week Cytonn cancelled its public listing plan citing the continued depressed performance of company stocks. \u201cWe\u2019ve decided to pull back given the equities market is not that vibrant. From our tests, the market is not willing to pay what we would have liked,\u201d CEO Dande said. However, the truth is that Cytonn PLC\u2019s current GCR rating implies an 83% chance of bankruptcy in 3-5 years.\n\nMost Home owners such as expatriates are sensitive to cost since they have housing budgets, beyond which they must seek approval from their head offices for extra rental expenditure. Cytonn has allegedly been taking advantage of this group since they have been moving away from high-end houses as bungalows, maisonettes, and townhouses to cheaper apartment unfortunately they are fleeing the country en masse.\n\nTheir newly finished CySuites Apartment Hotel, the latest offering under its Private Equity arm also looks to attract the same caliber of people in this depressed market and this is a no-brainer that that too will suffer many losses in this depressed economy.\n\nExperts say CySuites, which was launched in early this month can only manage to perform up to around March 2020 and then feel the heat of the lack of clients. At a time CIC is selling 712 acres of land and exiting the property development business; Britam PLC exiting the real estate development business with plans to auction properties in Upper Hill; the Athi River\u2019s Sunset Boulevard estate is in the red as I&M Bank plans to auction 204 units to recover a KSh 2 Billion debt investing in it does not require rocket science to know that Cytonn PLC would be the riskiest business ever. Real estate in Kenya looks rosy but that is further from the truth, the money used might as well come from public coffers; funded by the runaway corruption.", "articleBodyHtml": "<article>\n\n<p>It\u2019s now emerging that Cytonn Investments is embroiled in a fight with CMA and their license is at stake. Sensing danger, the firm quickly appointed Co-op Bank to be their trustee but the bank politely declined and did not disclose their reservations.</p>\n\n<p>The Four other banks that they approached also failed to take up the opportunity. This brings us to some of the observations we made a few months ago giving details why Cytonn is a risky investment as follows; Cytonn Investment Management PLC pauses as one of the independent investment management firm in Kenya which is doing well locally and in the region but beyond the what the eyes could see lies a company in deep problems.</p>\n\n<p>The recent regulations in real estate industry did not leave Cytonn\u2019s regulated clients in its Money Markets Fund and Pensions products. Cytonn\u2019s Investor Relations page also opted to conceal the 2017 and 2016 financial years\u2019 statements. And to make matters worse, they are yet to publish financial statements for FY 2018.</p>\n\n<p>While there are risks associated with every company but it\u2019s a lot more for Cytonn\u2019s clients. Most of the risk in Cytonn is centered in its real estate development arm. Cytonn\u2019s regulated clients in the Cytonn Money Market Fund and Cytonn Pensions products are equally exposed to loss as Cytonn\u2019s High Yield Solutions LLP clients.</p>\n\n<p>On the other hand, it\u2019s evident that StateBank of Mauritius (SBM) Kenya Limited and Taaleri Oyj also face losses to varying extents. Cytonn recently concealed its historical financial statements signifying there is more than meets the eye in the company. They are not releasing the new ones either. Months back, Cytonn was found deep into one of the dangerous PR gimmicks simply because they have failed to sell in this hard market, but in order to create an impression that things are going well, they had to resort to such cheap PR where one person would win nearly in every giveaways.</p>\n\n<p>Experts warn that the markets have not adequately understood the risk inherent in investing with Cytonn and urge caution. \u201cWhile the Cytonn brand represents a youthful freshness not seen in the staid financial services industry to date; we recommend that market participants remain cautious.\u201d A source told KMI.</p>\n\n<p>For the companies in real estate, it\u2019s no longer rosy for them. CIC is already selling 712 acres of land and exiting the property development business. Britam PLC on the other hand is exiting the real estate development business with plans to auction properties in Upper Hill and beyond to avoid losses across its portfolio. Also, a second developer in Athi River\u2019s Sunset Boulevard estate is in the red as I&amp;M Bank plans to auction 204 units to recover a KSh 2 Billion debt. The banking industry reports that Non Performing Loans (NPLs) to real estate developers amount to KSh 43 Billion.</p>\n\n<p>Cytonn has bet boldly on real estate. Since the firm offers clients, through Cytonn High Yield Solutions LLP, rates of up to 18% p.a based on loans made to its own projects. After admitting that CHYS rates are based on loan pricing, Cytonn cannot pose as a better real estate risk manager than banking and insurance firms which have more established track records. The falling Cytonn PLC is now acting as a bank thus offering loans to its own real estate projects at 18% p.a. This in real sense is not logical at all. CIC Britam PLC and I&amp;M Bank PLC are selling properties where Cytonn also has property- the Nairobi satellite towns in Kiambu and Kajiado counties.</p>\n\n<p>According to the notes in Cytonn\u2019s 2017 financial statements- Cytonn has properties in Kiambu County \u2013 The Alma, Taraji Heights, RiverRun Estates- where the greatest possibility for loss is. Banks have already moved to auction properties in these areas, fearing that lowering prices would lead to write offs and losses. Since Cytonn\u2019s residential properties are also located in these areas and have the same fundamentals; then its properties are also going to lose value.</p>\n\n<p>Don\u2019t forget that through the corporate guarantee given by Cytonn PLC, these properties underwrite the KSh 10.5 Billion in loans owed to Cytonn High Yield Solutions LLP clients Since Cytonn owes KSh 40 for every KSh 1 invested, even a small decline in property values (such as the 2.6% decline reported by Hass Consult in Q1 2019); would mean that Cytonn High Yield Solutions LLP clients are already losing money. Because properties sold at auction often sell for lower than their market value, Cytonn High Yield Solutions LLP clients are further exposed to loss.</p>\n\n<p>We find that in the present situation, selling Cytonn PLC\u2019s properties would not yield enough money to compensate all CHYS clients.

The judge said the application was premature.\n\n\u201cIf they successfully invalidate the Will, then there will be no basis to ask the executor to avail any information regarding the estate to court,\u201d the judge said.\n\nJustice Muchelule said if the Will was quashed, then the court would appoint an administrator or administrators, who will give a full and accurate inventory of the Rai family asset.\n\nJaswant has defended the Will, arguing that his father distributed to each family member the rightful stake in the business empire.\n\nBeneficiaries included his wife, Sarjij, his sons Jasbir, Jaswant, Sarbjit and Iqbal as well as daughters Hertej Ashwin Oza, Daljit Kaur Hans and Sarbjit.\n\nThe patriarch had also given some of his wealth to his son Tejpal, who died before him, according to Jaswant.\n\nThe widow and her two sons opposed the Will, saying Rai had left nothing to Jasbir, Iqbal and daughter Daljit. She also said her daughter Hertej had not been sufficiently provided for in the Will, urging for an additional stake.\n\nSarjij accused her son Jaswant of tabling a Will that omitted a huge chunk of the family properties.\n\nA list of properties provided by Jaswant in court includes Rai Plywoods (K) Ltd, Rai Produces Ltd, Rai Holdings Ltd, Rai Agriculture Enterprises Ltd, Rai Investments Ltd and Rai Ceramics Ltd.\n\nOthers are Tulip Properties Ltd, Rai Expo Park Ltd, and houses in Kampala, Runda in Nairobi and in Canada.\n\nTarlochan Singh Rai left behind money in an account at Absa, all estimated to be worth Sh329 million, and he had no liabilities, according to his son Jaswant.\n\nBut the widow opposed the list of the assets, their worth and liabilities. She reckoned that her husband declared in 1999 that he owned 42.72 percent of Rai Investments Limited, which Jaswant had placed at seven percent.\n\nJasbir and Iqbal told the court they had established that their father and brother were shareholders of Rai Holdings Limited in Kampala, which in 2006 bought a 51 percent stake in Kinyara Sugar Works at $33.5 million (Sh3.7 billion).\n\nThey also said that Tarlochan Singh Rai and Jaswant were shareholders in Rai Agro Industries Limited in Sangrur in India and companies known as Stonybrook Limited and Waterloo Limited both registered in Cayman Islands.\n\nOther companies allegedly left out in Will are Rai Management and Technical Services Limited registered in the tax haven of Jersey Island and millions of dollars in accounts at Citibank outlets in London and New Delhi.\n\nBefore his death, Tarlochan Singh Rai was locked in a court fight over the control of Rai Plywoods (Kenya) Ltd with his wife and sons.\n\nAccording to Sarjij, Rai", "articleBodyHtml": "<article>\n\n<p>The fight for the control of the <a href=\"https://kenyainsights.com/state-captured-dissecting-the-rai-family/\">Rai family</a>\u2019s multibillion-shilling estate is set to unravel in court as two sons of the late tycoon take on their brother Jaswant Rai over the distribution of wealth left behind by their father.</p>\n\n<p>At the centre of the dispute is the Will dated December 17, 1999, allegedly left behind by Tarlochan Singh Rai, who died on December 28, 2010, in Mumbai, India.</p>\n\n<p>Jaswant Rai, the chairman of Rai Group, is the executor of the Will.</p>\n\n<p>The widow, Sarjij Kaur Rai, had teamed up\u00a0with her sons, Jasbir and Iqbal, objecting to the Will, saying the patriarch could have been coerced in crafting the document that distributed his assets among his eight beneficiaries.</p>\n\n<p>They are also challenging Jaswant\u2019s push to get the court\u2019s permission to administer the multibillion-shilling business that has a presence across East Africa, Malawi, India and London.</p>\n\n<p>Sarjij had started giving evidence before High Court judge Aggrey Muchelule before she died in January this year.</p>\n\n<p>The court battle promises to offer Kenyans a peek into the wealth of the Rais, their financial dealings and the infighting that threatens to tear the family apart.</p>\n\n<p>The family is believed to have had close ties with the ruling elite in the Moi, Kibaki and Kenyatta administrations.</p>\n\n<p>They have interests in cement production (Rai Cement), edible oils and soaps (Menengai Oil Refineries), sawmilling (Timsales, RaiPly and Webuye Panpaper), wheat farming, horticulture, sugar industry (West Kenya, which owns Kabras Sugar) and real estate (Tulip Properties).</p>\n\n<p>Last year, the family acquired Dominion Farms in Siaya County\u2019s Yala Swamp after its American owner pulled out under controversial circumstances.</p>\n\n<p>Before her death, Sarjij and the two sons had wanted the court to summon company secretaries of Rai Investments Ltd and have them produce, among others, documents, the company\u2019s minutes, all board resolutions, and shares register from 1992 to date and all other relevant company records.</p>\n\n<p>She had wanted the company secretaries to also account for all the properties belonging to the family and Jaswant to produce a list of all assets of her late husband.</p>\n\n<p>Justice Muchelule, however, dismissed the application, saying the court should first determine the validity of the Will before calling the secretaries and Mr Jaswat to account.

On Thursday, Chebut Tea Factory became the last to carry out elections that were not supervised by KTDA head office and which, might, herald a new dawn on the relationship between the farmers and the agency\u2019s body, the Kenya Tea Development Management Service.\n\nBut as the elections were continuing, and in which KTDA-friendly directors were thrown out by farmers, some directors of KTDA Holdings Limited \u2013 the outfit which controls the age-old farmers\u2019 assets, some of which belonged to the parastatal Kenya Tea Development Authority, decided to pass resolutions which would give new shares to individual farmers.\n\nSugar coated poison\n\nOn the face of it, the deal looks good. But this is the last bait \u2013 or if you like; the last dose of a sugar coated poison; a poisoned chalice.\n\nLet me tell you a story.\n\nOnce upon a time, some clever people decided that the way to get control of Kenya largest sugar company, Mumias Sugar Company, which was being privatised, was by awarding shareholding to individual farmers rather than their entity, Mumias Outgrowers Company. They had support of politicians who thought this was a wise move and could earn them political mirage. Soon, when the shares were floated at the Nairobi Stocks Exchange, some brokers descended into Mumias villages and they took advantage of the poor farmers and bought the shares at as low as Sh2 down from the issue price of Sh6.2. Currently, just a handful of farmers can claim ownership of Mumias Sugar Company which has been run down. The farmers have no stake, can do nothing, and private entities now want to run Mumias.\n\nAnd that is why I am worried.\n\nKTDA Holdings directors have said that they will float the shares at the stock market and your guess is as good as mine. In 10 years, when the tradability of the shares will be lifted, according to KTDA, there will be a significant mop up of farmers\u2019 shares by brokers. Keep this paragraph for future reference.\n\nThe move by KTDA is not informed by overnight love for the farmer. Nay. It is informed by the fear of just a few. They don\u2019t want to let go the goose that lays the golden eggs. Since all the KTDA directors had either lost their seats at the factory-level, or had opted not to run, the HQ cartels decided in April to change the Articles of Association and create the new individual ownership category ostensibly \u201cto enable the allotment of the company shares to individual farmers under a new category of shareholders known as Tea Farmers.\u201d That is according to a KTDA press statement released on Sunday, May 23.\n\n\u201cAmong the new changes include a seat on the board of KTDA Holdings directly elected by the shareholders include voting for all company directors on the floor at the Annual General Meeting,\u201d said KTDA.\n\nWeaken factory\u2019s role\n\nIn essence, this will allow the KTDA directors, the same people who have impoverished tea farmers, a chance to run for directorship of KTDA and defeat efforts to streamline the tea sector. Further, the whole idea is to weaken the factory\u2019s role in the management of KTDA by dividing the farmers.\n\nThe smallholder farmers will be the main losers since their voices at the headquarters level will be drowned by the big farmers \u2013 who had lost control, thanks to the one-grower, one-vote rule.\n\nBut the plot could be deeper than that and the story of the giant Kenya Co-operative Creameries (KCC) can help us here.\n\nThe story of KCC\n\nIn 1979, President Moi ordered KCC to start distributing free milk to primary schools as part of a government programme. To KCC, this deal was too good to be true. During the 1979/80 financial year, the government had set aside Sh169 million for the project and KCC officials \u2014 and members \u2014 saw a new boom. It would prove to be a mirage soon as the government started faltering in payments and cutting down the allocation to a meagre Sh20 million during the 1998/99 financial year.\n\nBy this time, Moi had appointed his son, Raymond, as one of the KCC directors, and by 1996, the company had made a loss of Sh1.6 billion, was no longer paying farmers and was being cannibalised from within \u2013 through phony billings. Parliament was told that from 1993, several politically correct companies billed KCC for non-existent materials or inflated costs.\n\nFor instance, KCC would buy a bale of toilet paper at Sh445 when its actual cost was Sh150. From 1989 to 1996, Parliament was told, KCC never held any annual general meeting and as MPs was told, it was being led by the \u201cson of a sacred cow\u201d. As such, farmers went for years without pay and on August 5, 1999, KCC was placed under receivership under Mr Graham Shirlock of PriceWaterHouseCoopers.\n\nAccording to some court papers, Moi had approached Kenya Commercial Bank to appoint a receiver manager and stop asset haemorrhage. He then proceeded to conceptualise a structure into which dairy farmers could then invest and revive their fortunes and appointed respected personalities, General Daudi Tonje, Kipchoge Keino, B. Nightingale and P. Low to restructure KCC.\n\nAssume control\n\nWhen it appeared that the restructuring of KCC might actually succeed, Moi summoned a city lawyer and demanded that (he) wished to underwrite the entire process and would want to assume control of the eventual company. Moi had negotiated to purchase KCC from KCB for a sum of Sh400 million, while value of its assets then was \u201cin excess of Sh5 billion,\u201d according to court papers.\n\nIn 2000, two new companies KCC (2000) Limited and KCC Holdings Limited were incorporated and they ostensibly bought KCC Limited from the receiver for Sh400 million. KCC Holdings purported to invite a private placement on KCC shares.\n\nAnd this is where Moi registered a company and bought shares worth millions of shillings. Other barons also lined up.\n\nWhen Mwai Kibaki came to power and started to rescue KCC, and wanted to compensate the farmer shareholders, he found that it was Moi \u2013 using proxies, and entities such as Kabarak High and Kabarak Limited \u2013 who were, together with some cronies, the real owners of the KCC Holdings Limited.\n\nMischief\n\nWhat am I saying?\n\nThe distribution of the KTDA Holdings shares \u2013 at this late hour \u2013 is mischievous and could be as a result of realisation that the government might take over its assets within KTDA \u2013 which should be done \u2013 from the jaws of the current civil suit-loving carpetbaggers. As such, some people might be lining up for compensation just in case.\n\nIf you are in doubt, look at what transpired in KPCU which was once a solid institution. After it had been run down by cartels who never answered to the farmers, KPCU was finally put under receivership by KCB \u2013 the same institution which was part of the millers\u2019 historical problems.\n\nEvery time KPCU shareholders complained about the running of the company, the directors would form a probe committee made up of cronies. By the time Kibaki took presidency, nobody seemed to know the financial status of KPCU \u2013 its assets and liabilities. Some of the powerful Kibaki allies were also part of the coffee mess, too.\n\nIn March 2001, KPCU was put \u201con notice\u201d in a letter signed by Daniel Iriga, then the relationship manager with a threat: \u201cUnless arrears are cleared\u2026 we will call up the entire debt and cancel the limits of your overdraft accounts.\u201d\n\nKPCU assets sold\n\nSoon, the receivers arrived and started selling the KPCU assets. But something else happened. A city tycoon with deep pockets approached the bank and agreed to offset the loan in return he could get all the unallocated shares. He paid the loan and got control of KPCU and appointed his own managers.\n\nAnd those are the people who had seized the farmers\u2019 assets, worth billions of shillings, and had to be thrown out with the formation of New-KPCU to rescue the assets.\n\nFinally, there is the case of Kenya Seeds \u2013 which I had highlighted a few months ago here. In order to dilute the government shareholding at Kenya Seeds, the managers had purported to float shares and which were purchased by the managing director and his family. He is still fighting in court to control Kenya Seeds Company together with its assets.\n\nThus, what KTDA is trying to do has a history. Once upon a time, Kanu purported to transfer KICC to itself and it took an executive order to get it back.\n\nI will end this cry with the words of Edmund Burke: \u201cThe only thing necessary for the triumph of evil is for good men to do nothing.\u201d\n\nI have done my part.", "articleBodyHtml": "<article>\n\n<p>Tea farmers are just about to be swindled \u2013 and most likely, the barons who sit at the Kenya Tea Development Agency (KTDA) headquarters will do what some tycoons did to Kenya Seeds Company, Kenya Co-operative Creameries (KCC) and Kenya Planters Co-operative Union (KPCU) to take the farmers\u2019 entities for a song.</p>\n\n<p>That is unless they are not stopped.</p>\n\n<p>Untangling the tea farmer from what the barons want to do will be Agriculture Cabinet Secretary Peter Munya\u2019s last battle with the cartels.</p>\n\n<p>Currently, they are in the process of legalising their mischief \u2013 and they have made it public.

After it had been run down by cartels who never answered to the farmers, KPCU was finally put under receivership by KCB \u2013 the same institution which was part of the millers\u2019 historical problems.</p>\n\n<p>Every time KPCU shareholders complained about the running of the company, the directors would form a probe committee made up of cronies. By the time Kibaki took presidency, nobody seemed to know the financial status of KPCU \u2013 its assets and liabilities. Some of the powerful Kibaki allies were also part of the coffee mess, too.</p>\n\n<p>In March 2001, KPCU was put \u201con notice\u201d in a letter signed by Daniel Iriga, then the relationship manager with a threat: \u201cUnless arrears are cleared\u2026 we will call up the entire debt and cancel the limits of your overdraft accounts.\u201d</p>\n\n<p><strong>KPCU assets sold</strong></p>\n\n<p>Soon, the receivers arrived and started selling the KPCU assets. But something else happened. A city tycoon with deep pockets approached the bank and agreed to offset the loan in return he could get all the unallocated shares. He paid the loan and got control of KPCU and appointed his own managers.</p>\n\n<p>And those are the people who had seized the farmers\u2019 assets, worth billions of shillings, and had to be thrown out with the formation of New-KPCU to rescue the assets.</p>\n\n<p>Finally, there is the case of Kenya Seeds \u2013 which I had highlighted a few months ago here. In order to dilute the government shareholding at Kenya Seeds, the managers had purported to float shares and which were purchased by the managing director and his family. He is still fighting in court to control Kenya Seeds Company together with its assets.</p>\n\n<p>Thus, what KTDA is trying to do has a history. Once upon a time, Kanu purported to transfer KICC to itself and it took an executive order to get it back.</p>\n\n<p>I will end this cry with the words of Edmund Burke: \u201cThe only thing necessary for the triumph of evil is for good men to do nothing.\u201d</p>\n\n<p>I have done my part.</p>\n\n</article>", "canonicalUrl": "https://kenyanmarketintelligence.com/in-footsteps-of-mumias-sugar-kcc-tea-agency-offers-farmers-poisoned-chalice/"},{"url": "https://kenyanmarketintelligence.com/the-scary-reason-healthy-people-die-after-an-er-visit/", "probability": 0.9920367, "headline": "The Scary Reason Healthy People Die After an ER Visit", "datePublished": "2019-05-24T12:04:00+03:00", "datePublishedRaw": "2019-05-24T12:04:00+03:00", "dateModified": "2019-05-24T12:04:00+03:00", "dateModifiedRaw": "2019-05-24T12:04:00+03:00", "author": "admin", "authorsList": ["admin"], "inLanguage": "en", "breadcrumbs": [{"name": "Home", "link": "https://kenyanmarketintelligence.com"}, {"link": "https://kenyanmarketintelligence.com?name=the-scary-reason-healthy-people-die-after-an-er-visit"}, {"name": "Home", "link": "https://kenyanmarketintelligence.com"}, {"link": "https://kenyanmarketintelligence.com?name=the-scary-reason-healthy-people-die-after-an-er-visit"}], "mainImage": "https://kenyanmarketintelligence.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/news7.jpg", "images": ["https://kenyanmarketintelligence.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/news3.jpg", "https://kenyanmarketintelligence.com/wp-content/themes/jnews/assets/img/jeg-empty.png"], "description": "Intro text we refine our methods of responsive web design, we\u2019ve increasingly focused on measure and its relationship to how people read.

The statement only said that the deal would involve 10 ordinary shares of NBK for every one ordinary share of KCB.\n\nWhen the details of the transaction are finally put out, it will be interesting to see how the vexing issue of the mainly government-owned preference shares in the books of the bank \u2014 which have always been the deal breaker for investors interested in buying the bank \u2014 will be treated.\n\nThe takeover of NBK by Kenya Commercial Bank (KCB) has been surrounded by facilitating regulators and approvals in Annual General Meetings to give an impression of transparency. It is not.\n\nThe Ordinary shareholders in NBK are 48%, belonging to workers through NSSF and 30% that belongs to small shareholders. The bank also has non-convertible and non-redeemable preference shareholders who have no ownership rights under company law and CMA rules whatsoever, and are simply a glorified debt item on balance sheet.\n\nThe reason behind a listed bank that belongs to the workers of Kenya (48%), small shareholders (30%) and government (22%) being taken over at a tenth of its value and without paying a cent of cash by a bank that largely belongs to private shareholders in an very hideous unlawful is still unknown.\n\nThe Board of NBK cannot decide to sell the 22% of GoK shareholding. Public Procurements and Disposal Act and related procedures including a request for proposal (RFP) and open tender system must be conducted in an open and transparent way. This is mandatory to sell anything that belongs to GoK. How is 22% of GoK Shares in NBK being transferred by the Board of NBK?\n\nThe CBK Governor on record before the Parliamentary Finance Committee claims there is no other option for NBK but to be sold to KCB despite saying the problem is bad management.

There is no question raised on the obvious undervaluation of NBK in this transaction.

I was diagnosed with severe Aplastic Anemia. A very rare blood disorder where your bone marrow stops producing sufficient blood. This meant I was really weak and tired all the time. It is the little bags of life (blood transfusions) that kept me going. These little bags literally bought me more time. It hasn\u2019t always been like this though, so let me take you back right to the beginning.\n\nMy name Is Janet Cheng\u2019etich Bett- Karoney and this is my life.\n\nI turned 31 this year. I am the fourth child in our family and a size 3 shoe. My dad felt I was very special and different, while I shared my giggly and humorous side with my mum. We were always laughing and cracking jokes.\n\nI always found the school part of Eulogies boring. I don\u2019t want mine to be the same. So allow me to summarize. I did go to school. I did really well (Like I was the top girl in my GCSE class!) and went on to graduate from Strathmore University. Funny story though, apparently. I loved school so much that t was always the first in the car &cried when my siblings would make us late.\n\nMy life was not all about academia though\u2026 When I joined Strathmore University. I met the love of my life Brian Kipchumba Karoney. You see. Brian\u2019s uncle is my dad\u2019s friend and had requested Brian to look for me. Destiny right? We built a friendship based on fun, humor, play and intellectual discourse. After 6 years of dating. Brian proposed to me in the most unforgettable way. Just to give you some details, can you imagine he rented out the entire Cinema at Prestige Plaza and created an emotional movie that incorporated my loved ones, asking for my hand in marriage. We tied the knot on the 12th of December, 2017 in a super colourful ceremony by my standards\u2019.\n\nNow let me tell you about my husband. Brian is loving, kind and selfless. Out of this beautiful love came our princess Nemye. Our strong friendship and love reflected in our little family. We were inseparable.\n\n\u201cMy husband is truly the perfect husband. He stood with me till the end. I have no doubt whatsoever that Nemye is in great hands and no one will take care of her and protect her more than Brian.\u201d\n\nMy \u2018Kamatis\u2019 also welcomed me into their family with so much love and support. I was basically one of them. Mum and Dad supported and accepted me, making sure I was always comfortable.\n\nI was passionate about my career. I started out at Simba Colt as an intern and later got a full time position in the tech team. I later moved to Nexus where I got the opportunity to serve as General Manager. Talk about moving on up. I pivoted into the startup world at Women Work Kenya right after that.\n\nAs a typical Kenyan, I had an entrepreneurial spirit. (My siblings at one point nicknamed me \u201chustler\u201d because I was always full of entrepreneurial ideas.) I started two businesses, namely Jay Bride (This was going to be the next big thing and was a one-stop shop for brides planning for their big day). I had just recently launched Fat Cheque after working on it for a very long time. A lot of people who know me know I was always on one diet or another, and always met many who were the same. So I figured if it was made into a game/competition it would give extra motivation.\n\nI had a fun and full social life and really enjoyed spending time with my friends. I had a close knit circle with whom we shared many memories together from my Rusinga high school friends group which was dubbed \u201cNgware MCs\u201d as a tribute to the neighbouring area to my Braeside friends who we have shared a lot of memories, travel, and life experiences. I was blessed to have made really close friends at work too.\n\nThe final chapter:\n\nLike I had mentioned I was diagnosed with a severe illness that changed my life so quickly and resulted in us gathering here today. In the last two months, from my diagnosis, I felt overwhelming love and support both monetary and emotionally and fought hard to the end. Somewhere along the way, my immunity was greatly compromised and I caught an infection. With my low blood count, my body was unable to fight the infection. This was sudden and difficult, but my love resides in all of you.\n\nMy Legacy:\n\nI felt it is important to let you guys in on this rare condition. I had big plans to raise awareness about Aplastic Anemia after my treatment. Clearly, that\u2019s not possible now so I really need your help. Like I had previously mentioned, severe Aplastic Anemia is a blood condition that attacks the bone marrow and greatly reduces one\u2019s platelet and blood count This means that my treatment was multifaceted. I had to do several blood transfusions while my family got tested to find a match for a bone marrow transplant. This would give me a 90% chance to live. My siblings unfortunately were not a match (thanks guys!) It was not their fault though. Did you know there is only a 25% chance of matching with a sibling? Also, only 10 percent of the bone marrow registry in the world are black people. You can imagine how slim my chances of finding a match were.\n\nIt was also my dream to find a way to enable Bone Marrow Transplants to become available in Kenya, so other families who face this do not have to travel for treatment like I did and can have their families around them to support them.\n\nMy prayer & final words:\n\nLord, make me a rainbow, I\u2019ll shine down on my mother\n\nShe\u2019ll know I\u2019m safe with you when she stands under my colors\n\nAin\u2019t even gray, but she buries her baby\n\nWell. I\u2019ve had just enough time\n\nWhat I never did is done\n\nGather up your tears, keep \u2019em in your pocket\n\nSave \u2019em for a time when you\u2019re really gonna need \u2019em, oh\n\nAnd I\u2019ll be wearing white when I go into His kingdom\n\nSo put on your best, and I\u2019ll wear my pearls\n\nSend me away with the words of a love song\n\nUntil we meet again", "articleBodyHtml": "<article>\n\n<p>It takes an enormous amount of courage and strength to get yourself up from your hospital bed and write your own eulogy.</p>\n\n<p>This is the story of Janet Bett Karoney, a 31-year-old woman who was diagnosed with severe Aplastic Anemia and succumbed after getting an infection.</p>\n\n<p>WebMD describes aplastic anemia is a\u00a0rare but treatable condition that occurs when your body stops producing enough new blood cells, thereby leaving \u00a0one fatigued and prone to infections.</p>\n\n<p>Janet, after battling this condition to the very best of her will and sensing that she was nearing the end of her rope, picked up the keyboard and wrote her own story her own way.</p>\n\n<p>She chronicled her early life as a kid who loved sharing jokes with her mother, albeit also a bit nerdy in school.

In the last two months, from my diagnosis, I felt overwhelming love and support both monetary and emotionally and fought hard to the end. Somewhere along the way, my immunity was greatly compromised and I caught an infection. With my low blood count, my body was unable to fight the infection. This was sudden and difficult, but my love resides in all of you.</p>\n\n<p><strong>My Legacy:</strong></p>\n\n<p>I felt it is important to let you guys in on this rare condition. I had big plans to raise awareness about Aplastic Anemia after my treatment. Clearly, that\u2019s not possible now so I really need your help. Like I had previously mentioned, severe Aplastic Anemia is a blood condition that attacks the bone marrow and greatly reduces one\u2019s platelet and blood count This means that my treatment was multifaceted. I had to do several blood transfusions while my family got tested to find a match for a bone marrow transplant. This would give me a 90% chance to live. My siblings unfortunately were not a match (thanks guys!) It was not their fault though. Did you know there is only a 25% chance of matching with a sibling? Also, only 10 percent of the bone marrow registry in the world are black people. You can imagine how slim my chances of finding a match were.</p>\n\n<p>It was also my dream to find a way to enable Bone Marrow Transplants to become available in Kenya, so other families who face this do not have to travel for treatment like I did and can have their families around them to support them.</p>\n\n<p><strong>My prayer &amp; final words:</strong></p>\n\n<p>Lord, make me a rainbow, I\u2019ll shine down on my mother</p>\n\n<p>She\u2019ll know I\u2019m safe with you when she stands under my colors</p>\n\n<p>Ain\u2019t even gray, but she buries her baby</p>\n\n<p>Well.

I remember | took a loan with them at Kitengela branch. About 300K, | gave them my cheques sometimes they don\u2019t deposit the cheques then they slap me with huge penalties. | ask one of there staffs there what is my current balance? You still have to pay interest and penalties that have accrued plus tracking. Jesus is Lord! | requested them for a waiver, they advised me to write a letter to their director, when | stated following on the feedback, again they told me nothing can be done its your obligation to pay the loan. Remember | gave them my cheques. I can tell they are after our cars and money that\u2019s their main interest. If you go to sign the loan agreement, you are not given the copy, if you request to take a photo of the agreement, you are told our boss doesn\u2019t allow that. After paying over 600k | still have a balance of 200k. They are investing in us.\u201d Nicodemus King\u2019ola\u2019s message to Alai reads. According to their website, Mwananchi Credit Limited brags of being the leading provider of secured emergency Loans in Kenya. Dennis Mombo is the Executive Chairman and founding member of the Mwananchi Credit Limited according to his linked in profile.\n\nInitially trading as Mwananchi Microlink Ltd from 15th April 2010, it officially changed names to Mwananchi Credit Limited on 10th January 2012.\n\nMany unsuspecting Kenyans get enticed easily when they see that they are offering logbook loans from as low as 2.5% pm with the loans allegedly being disbursed within 6 hours.\n\nBesides Logbook Loans, Mwananchi Credit also offers an array of other secured emergency loans including; Title Deed Loans, Asset Financing ( Car Loans ), Import Financing, Cheque Discounting, Check off Loans ( For Civil Servants and MoU companies), Salary advance loans, Trade Financing ( Bid bonds, Performance bonds, advance payment guarantees)\n\nSo, why are these micro finances not being regulated while proof of alleged fraud and con pieces of evidence are being splashed online by affected members?\n\nIn 2018, the Co-operative Alliance of Kenya (CAK), an umbrella lobby for the 15 million-member-strong co-operative movement in Kenya, rejected the amendments to the co-operative law affecting 22,000 unions and societies.\n\n\u201cOnce a person is admitted into membership of a co-operative society, he ranks equal with other members in respect to fundamental issues such as the minimum number of shares he subscribes to and pays for (and) one vote irrespective of shares held and interest in the society,\u201d said CAK Executive Director Daniel Marube.\n\nThe reforms would have allowed, by way of an ordinary resolution approved by the Cabinet secretary, creation of a class of members to be referred to as \u201csocial impact members\u201d. These shall not be subject to the primary and normal requirement that each member has to subscribe and purchase a given number of shares to be admitted into membership of a co-operative.\n\nIn further amendments, social impact members will enjoy the right to attend and participate in decisions taken in a general meeting of the society and to vote. They will also have the privilege of being elected into organs of society.\n\nHere are a few of the reactions and comments from other Kenyans on Facebook. Samuel Thiongo Mwananchi Credit, Plantinun, Momentum Credit name them\u2026 these are Shylocks disguised as saccos\u2026.avoid them if you can Habana Haba These credit companies know quite well the minute you walk in your car is gone.they even have buyers lined up already.it is always in their interest that you default,not that you pay.and they know if you give your car as collateral(they give 30% of the value-which they seriously undervalue)someone who loaned 300k on a 1m car will not do a miracle and get the 300k plus interest otherwise they would have done it and not come to them.almost 90% of people default.you give your car on 1st you pay interest only on 30th ,already they know you will get stuck.they will eat the interest for 3 months, 6 months and your car is being paid for by someone.its not yours anymore but you are still paying interest.you will either opt out they sell the car or pay for the rest of your life-interest only.

The mechanism has facilitated the development of a credit history for Kenyans to enable them access cheaper credit.\nThis is particularly important for those borrowers who do not have collateral such as title deeds that have traditionally been used to secure credit.\nThe framework has been strengthened over time, most recently in April 2020, with the issuance of revised Regulations. The improvements in the CIS are to be seen against a backdrop of two important anchors to strengthen the behaviour of banks.\n\nFirst, banks are now required to adopt a risk-based pricing approach thatconsiders borrowers\u2019 credit reports in the pricing of loans. Second, CRBs are\nrequired to generate borrowers\u2019 credit score that lenders can use to assess their creditworthiness. It is therefore an important tool in ensuring that the banking sector works for and with Kenyans, as was outlined in the Kenya Banking Sector Charter, that was launched in February 2019, by CBK.\n\nAn important development was the suspension of the sharing of negative information for a period of six months from April 1 to September 30, 2020, to\nmitigate the economic impact of the COVID-19 pandemic. Loans that were performing, but became non-performing during that period would not lead to a \u201cblacklisting\u201d of the borrowers.\n\nIn making its recommendation for the suspension to September 30, 2022, CBK was cognizant of the need to balance between providing relief to MSMEs, while safeguarding the effectiveness and sustainability of the CIS framework. The CIS\nmechanism aims to bridge the information gap about borrowers\u2019 creditworthiness by considering the borrower\u2019s credit history and allowing credit to be priced accordingly. A good credit record demonstrates the borrower\u2019s higher creditworthiness and should lead to a lower cost of credit. In this regard, the suspension could adversely impact the provision of credit by banks to the target group, as they will be unable to distinguish between the good and bad borrowers\nduring the suspension period.

including savings in a number of commercial banks, pointing to the vast wealth that the <a href=\"https://kenyanmarketintelligence.com/mps-read-mischief-in-kengen-kplc-kenatco-hiring-private-audit-firms/\">Ketraco</a> manager had accumulated over the past decade.</p>\n\n<p>According to documents filed by the EACC in court, Mr Njehia\u2019s salary between 2010 and March 2021 stood at Sh35.7 million-plus imprest amounting to Sh4.48 million.</p>\n\n<p>It is alleged that Mr Njehia used his position to influence and award tenders at Ketraco and the Ministry of Transport, where he previously worked.</p>\n\n<p>\u201cThe respondent has illegally and irregularly engaged in the influence and award of tenders, procurement and payment of goods and services, which has seen him abuse his office, receive bribes, embezzle public funds and engage in corrupt conduct,\u201d the EACC said in the petition filed before the anti-corruption division of the High court.</p>\n\n<p>\u201cThere are reasonable grounds to suspect that the respondent herein has accumulated assets disproportionate to his known legitimate source of income and money in the listed SACCO accounts should be preserved pending completion of the subject investigations,\u201d the EACC told Justice Maina.</p>\n\n<p>Mr Njehia allegedly made frequent deposits into his bank and SACCO accounts.</p>\n\n<p>The commission said it was investigating his close family members, including his spouse Julie Hellen Matu and associated companies where he could have channelled the funds, and that it will soon be filing a petition to freeze the properties.</p>\n\n<p>\u201cAn analysis of the preliminary investigations has raised reasonable suspicion that considering the respondent\u2019s salary, large and frequent deposits into his bank accounts, shares and deposits in his SACCO account are disproportionate to his legitimate known sources of income and could have been obtained through corrupt conduct,\u201d the EACC said.</p>\n\n</article>", "canonicalUrl":
