Every year we are smiling all the way to the banks and thus able to meet our financial obligations,\u201d Serem noted.\n\nCounty Governments in the region a few years ago initiated crop diversification programmes with a view to supplementing farmers\u2019 dwindling incomes.\n\nUasin Gishu county executive in charge of agriculture and livestock Samuel Yego confirms that maize farming, even though still viable, has in the recent past experienced a lot of changes like declining prices and high cost of production among others.\n\nThus, Yego says prompted the County to advise farmers to diversify to other crops so that they can remain financially strong and equally be able to endure other challenges like the vagaries of climate change.\n\n\u201cWe are encouraging farmers to plant high-value crops to maximize and earn more from their land. Some of these high-value crops can earn you twice a year. We are promoting the growth of avocado, coffee, macadamia, tissue culture bananas and also export vegetables,\u201d Yego noted.\n\nHe said avocado is becoming food of choice for many people in the world and, \u201cKenya being at the equator where we enjoy almost 12 hours of sunshine, we will be able to harvest avocados when the rest of the world is not able to,\u201d he added.\n\nAccording to the growers, commercial avocado farming, though a relatively new venture, is more profitable due to the ready market and low cost of production.\n\nThe emergence of Agri-business community groups\n\nSerem ventured into avocado farming in 2018 and since then has planted 180 trees where 100 of them are mature and he is already harvesting.\n\nHe has so far earned Ksh150, 000 from the avocados he has harvested this year, which he said is four times more than what he could earn from maize in one acre per year in the past.\n\n\u201cI have been a maize and wheat farmer for many years but I have since reduced my acreage under maize to get into avocado farming. I believe this will earn me more money than maize as there is a ready market and the cost of production is minimal,\u201d he said.\n\nSerem is a member of the Kapsosio Avocado Agri Community Group (KAACG) which has 78 farmers who have been contracted by Habex Agro Limited Company for 10 years to grow avocados for the export market in the European Union, mainly Spain and Germany.\n\n\u201cHabex Company provided us with avocados seedlings and I opted to change because I was tired of maize farming. We harvested for the first time after two years and since every twice a year we harvest and the return on investment is high by far compared to maize farming.

Since then production has increased to 40kgs per bush pushing earnings to over Ksh300,000 for a season.\n\n\u201cWith avocados, you are likely to harvest three times in a year. If I was farming maize, I would have earned between Ksh25, 000 to Ksh30, 000 in a year and if it\u2019s deducted the cost of production, I will be left with minimal earnings not adequate to service my financial obligations,\u201d Toroitich noted.\n\nKevin Koimat, a youth, recalls the resistance he encountered from his parents when he proposed to start avocado farming.\n\nKoimat,27, says four years down the line avocado farming has transformed his life and he cannot regret not seeking formal employment after graduating with a diploma in petroleum engineering from the Rift Valley Technical Training Institute in Eldoret.\n\n\u201cI started growing avocado in 2018 but it took some time to convince my mother to give me a portion of land to plant avocado instead of maize.

Avocado production in the country increased to 84.5 million kilogrammes between Jan-Nov 2021 compared to 70 million kilos in the same period in 2020,\u201d Tito noted.\n\nYego, Uasin Gishu County Agriculture CEC insisted his region is still one of the food basket Counties in the country with maize being the main focus crop.\n\n\u201cWe are still growing more than 100,000 hectares of maize although the production area progressively will decrease as farmers shift to high-value crops. But the area under wheat production has been decreasing and currently stands at 16,500 hectares with the reduction blamed on the increased cost of production especially on chemicals. There is also a lot of competition in the market especially with wheat from Ukraine, besides the effect of climate change,\u201d he said.\n\nThe CEC pointed out that the County has so far supported farmers with close to 150,000 avocado seedlings translating to close to 700 hectares.", "articleBodyHtml": "<article>\n\n<p>Francis Serem and Beatrice Toroitich are small scale farmers in Uasin Gishu County who for many years have been farming maize.</p>\n\n<p>The farmers have been producing subsistence and commercial maize with the Government through the National Cereals and Produce Board (NCPB) offering ready market every year.</p>\n\n<p>Until a few years ago small scale farmers from the grain basket regions enjoyed ready markets for their produce as the Government factored funds in the budget to buy maize through the NCPB every year.</p>\n\n<p>This is despite the farmers grappling with the high cost of production and fluctuating prices leading to low returns, poor harvests and huge post-harvest losses.</p>\n\n<p>North Rift has now emerged as the new frontier in terms of high-value crops mainly avocado farming joining the league of leading producers in the country such as counties of Murang\u2019a, Kiambu, Nakuru, Nyamira, Kisii, Meru and Bomet.</p>\n\n<p>Maize as a commodity despite being a political crop has equally been hijacked by unscrupulous traders and cartels denying the small scale farmers an opportunity to enjoy their hard-earned sweat.</p>\n\n<p>And now with the grain basket region shifting to high-value crops and mainly horticulture, the country\u2019s food security is at risk, a situation likely to increase the annual food import bill.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Government decision </strong></p>\n\n<p>Kenya is the leading exporter of avocado in Africa and among the top ten world\u2019s largest exporters although out of the total production of 84.5 million kilograms produced only 10 per cent was exported.</p>\n\n<p>About five years ago, the Government stopped buying maize directly from the small scale farmers and instead transformed NCPB into a commercial entity where it is now competing with other players in the market.</p>\n\n<p>Even though the Government action did not augur well to the majority of farmers in the region, to Serem and Toroitich the move was a blessing in disguise.</p>\n\n<p>\u201cAs we could not have thought of venturing into avocado farming which is paying well by far compared to maize. Every year we are smiling all the way to the banks and thus able to meet our financial obligations,\u201d Serem noted.</p>\n\n<p>County Governments in the region a few years ago initiated crop diversification programmes with a view to supplementing farmers\u2019 dwindling incomes.</p>\n\n<p>Uasin Gishu county executive in charge of agriculture and livestock Samuel Yego confirms that maize farming, even though still viable, has in the recent past experienced a lot of changes like declining prices and high cost of production among others.</p>\n\n<p>Thus, Yego says prompted the County to advise farmers to diversify to other crops so that they can remain financially strong and equally be able to endure other challenges like the vagaries of climate change.</p>\n\n<p>\u201cWe are encouraging farmers to plant high-value crops to maximize and earn more from their land. Some of these high-value crops can earn you twice a year. We are promoting the growth of avocado, coffee, macadamia, tissue culture bananas and also export vegetables,\u201d Yego noted.</p>\n\n<p>He said avocado is becoming food of choice for many people in the world and, \u201cKenya being at the equator where we enjoy almost 12 hours of sunshine, we will be able to harvest avocados when the rest of the world is not able to,\u201d he added.</p>\n\n<p>According to the growers, commercial avocado farming, though a relatively new venture, is more profitable due to the ready market and low cost of production.</p>\n\n<p><strong>The emergence of Agri-business community groups</strong></p>\n\n<p>Serem ventured into avocado farming in 2018 and since then has planted 180 trees where 100 of them are mature and he is already harvesting.</p>\n\n<p>He has so far earned Ksh150, 000 from the avocados he has harvested this year, which he said is four times more than what he could earn from maize in one acre per year in the past.</p>\n\n<p>\u201cI have been a maize and wheat farmer for many years but I have since reduced my acreage under maize to get into avocado farming. I believe this will earn me more money than maize as there is a ready market and the cost of production is minimal,\u201d he said.</p>\n\n<p>Serem is a member of the Kapsosio Avocado Agri Community Group (KAACG) which has 78 farmers who have been contracted by Habex Agro Limited Company for 10 years to grow avocados for the export market in the European Union, mainly Spain and Germany.</p>\n\n<p>\u201cHabex Company provided us with avocados seedlings and I opted to change because I was tired of maize farming. We harvested for the first time after two years and since every twice a year we harvest and the return on investment is high by far compared to maize farming.

William Ruto just like the main suspect in the murder of her daughter Governor Okoth Obado.\n\nSpeaking to the media, Auma who has declared to run for a ward representative seat on a United Democratic Alliance (UDA) ticket said that she did not know that Governor Obado was also supporting Ruto.\n\nGovernor Obado who is serving his second term as the Migori County boss was voted on an Orange Democratic Movement (ODM) ticket in the 2017 general elections.\n\nFour months ago, Auma also declared her interest to serve as the Homabay Town West MCA and will contest in the 2022 general elections on a UDA ticket.\n\nIn her explanation, Auma said that she was forced to join politics by circumstances after she was deceived by ODM leaders who attended the burial of her daughter at her Homabay
