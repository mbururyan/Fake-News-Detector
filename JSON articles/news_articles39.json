Even though I\u2019d been able to dress up for the occasion (in a dress with pockets, no less!), it had felt strange to be back in this constrained environment having become used to the freedom many of us have begun to enjoy as restrictions ease.\n\nA week earlier I had been standing on various stages at the Intra-Africa Trade Fair in Durban, attended by around 15,000 people with renewed optimism. It felt like a reunion. Executives and policymakers whom I hadn\u2019t seen in person in two years, all bright-eyed about Africa\u2019s resilience and ready for a more integrated, powerful continent.\n\nI moderated numerous panel discussions but one in particular stood out: how tourism will help kickstart Africa\u2019s economy. All the talk there was about how the world is finally emerging from the shadow of Covid, and perhaps we could finally look forward, rather than back. As I packed my bags in Johannesburg those words were ringing in my ears when I heard the news that, due to the Omicron variant, I wouldn\u2019t be going anywhere.\n\nWhat I hadn\u2019t priced in was the aggressive and swift imposition of travel bans. The UK kickstarted a cascade of falling dominoes as countries quickly placed South Africa and neighbouring countries on their red lists.\n\nI soon realised that by sleeping on the news my exit strategy had crumbled. Dubai had expedited its own ban and direct flights were cancelled altogether, while flights to other possible gateway \u2018safe country\u2019 quarantine destinations filled up almost immediately. It was complete chaos, with people left at the airport with very little certainty about what was to come, and prospects of any kind of travel diminishing by the hour.\n\nI was in many ways among the lucky ones. I was able to stay with family, set myself up to continue working, and report for CNN on what rapidly became the biggest story of the week. But being part of that story in a literal sense gave me an intimate perspective on what was going on, and I\u2019ll admit, a sense of disbelief at how events had played out.\n\nSouth Africa has been praised for its efforts in genomic sequencing, an area in which it truly excels, as well as its transparency in alerting the world to the presence of this new variant; but it has also been, many have argued, punished for both.\n\nAs we know from the discovery of a number of past variants, just because one has been discovered somewhere, does not mean that it originated there. As we have since found out, Omicron already exists in many other countries, including the UK, which was the first to ban travel from South Africa. The latest reporting even confirms that Omicron was in Europe, in the Netherlands, before it was flagged by South Africa.\n\nTravel restrictions might appear to be a logical step in containing these new variants, but as CNN\u2019s senior medical analyst, Dr Jonathan Reiner, said on Monday, they may offer \u201can illusion of protection.\u201d As Dr Reiner put it, \u201cit\u2019s like locking a screen door. You feel like you\u2019ve done something to protect yourself, but you really haven\u2019t.\u201d\n\nIt is also difficult to escape the notion that this latest series of travel bans unfairly targets African nations. Even the WHO called for borders to remain open, its regional director for Africa, Matshidiso Moeti, saying on Sunday that the bans targeting Africa \u201cattack global solidarity\u201d, and \u201cexploit our divisions.\u201d\n\nIn tandem with all of this is the ongoing conversation about vaccine inequality, which the global south has been pressing wealthier nations on for many months now. With less than 25% of its population fully vaccinated, South Africa lags well behind much of the world, according to Our World in Data. While the United States, with over 59% of its population vaccinated, and the UK, with almost 69%, are busy distributing booster shots, how to get first vaccines into the arms of South Africans remains extraordinarily challenging.\n\nAnother way of looking at these statistics \u2013 the number of actual doses given \u2013 is even more stark. The USA has given 459 million vaccine doses to its population. China an incredible 2.33 billion. By contrast, South Africa has given just 25.4 million.\n\nWe know, because we have been warned time and time again, that the greatest threat to the global recovery from Covid-19 is the unvaccinated. It is among this population that mutations are occurring. It is these people, whether by choice or by accident of birth, who are endangering any kind of return to normal life. So why do so many African countries lag so far behind the world when it comes to vaccinations, and what can be done to change that?\n\nOne possible opportunity is local manufacture. There has to date been considerable resistance to sharing vaccine patents, particularly from the European Union. On Monday, nursing unions in 28 countries around the world called for the temporary waiver of patents for Covid vaccines. Their plea, via a letter to the UN, called the distribution of vaccines unjust and blamed it for \u201cstaggering numbers of deaths\u201d. US President Joe Biden also joined a call to the WTO to waive the Trade-Related Aspects of Intellectual Property Rights (Trips) agreement in regard to vaccines last Friday.\n\nPlacing manufacturing in the hands of local companies at least removes a significant step from an already complex supply chain. Janssen Pharmaceuticals, part of Johnson & Johnson, this week announced a deal with South Africa\u2019s Aspen Pharma, which will enable Aspen to sell the J&J vaccine to African countries under its own brand. This feels like an important moment, and a start.\n\nThe idea of waiving patents for life saving drugs takes me back to the HIV AIDS epidemic, when people in Sub Saharan African were dying at an alarming rate, while pharmaceutical companies held tightly onto IP rights of antiretrovirals. When treatment cost thousands of dollars, poorer nations simply couldn\u2019t afford to save their people. After much negotiation \u2013 I\u2019m told by some close to the talks, more akin to begging \u2013 pharma companies relented and allowed generic drug makers to reverse engineer ARVs for the African market. It was a game-changing moment.\n\nThere remain major logistical and psychological challenges beyond local manufacture and patent sharing, of course. Vaccine hesitancy is a persistent and difficult obstacle to overcome in South Africa, and transport and refrigeration are major issues in many African countries.\n\nSitting here in Johannesburg, scanning the newswires and consulting with travel agents as I look to somehow make it back to the UAE, I\u2019m also struck by a wider lesson here, one that we were supposed to learn from Covid, and clearly have not.\n\nThe pandemic was supposed to be an opportunity for us to come together, united against a common foe. It has produced extraordinary tales of bravery, ingenuity and resilience, as well as profound loss and tragedy; but it has also exacerbated divisions and turned many of us inward.\n\nlast week, South Africa reported its unemployment rate is 35%. That\u2019s a third of the population without work. The expanded definition takes unemployment to 45%. The hardest hit sectors are hospitality and tourism.\n\nYet another warning that the world must pay attention to comes from the UN: that more African countries will be plunged into poverty thanks to these latest bans.\n\nThe Malawian President says that the bans are Afrophobic. They hold no benefit and will result in immense pain for a continent already desperately trying to recover with resources that pale in comparison to the stimulus packages richer nations were able to deploy. The economic damage will be enormous and cannot be given a quick fix.\n\nAt a national level, last week has been a reminder of just how far apart we are, and how quickly nations close the door rather than stretch out a hand. It has also been a reminder of how old prejudices and inequalities run deep. One thing seems certain: we will not end this pandemic if we do not change the way we fight it, and we must do that together.\n\nAfrica is a resilient continent and used to fighting through challenges, but with such an abundance of global resources it doesn\u2019t need to suffer this acutely. This time the stark global inequities that divide us cannot be ignored \u2013 African leaders are more vocal than ever. And Africans may not forgive being forgotten.", "articleBodyHtml": "<article>\n\n<figure><img src=\"https://thedailymail.co.ke/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/Eleni-Giokos-696x463.jpeg\" srcset=\"https://thedailymail.co.ke/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/Eleni-Giokos-696x463.jpeg 696w, https://thedailymail.co.ke/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/Eleni-Giokos.jpeg 1392w\" sizes=\"(-webkit-min-device-pixel-ratio: 2) 1392px, (min-resolution: 192dpi) 1392px, 696px\" alt=\"\" title=\"CNN Expansion, Eleni Giokos\"><figcaption>CNN Expansion, Eleni Giokos</figcaption></figure>\n\n<p><strong><em>Eleni Giokos anchors Connecting Africa and Marketplace Middle East on CNN International</em></strong></p>\n\n<p>At the end of last week, I wrapped up the last of my work commitments in Johannesburg and prepared to head to the airport, ready to return to my new home in Dubai.</p>\n\n<p>I\u2019d been presenting an awards ceremony for journalists in South Africa and lamenting the fact that ongoing Covid precautions meant that we\u2019d had to do it virtually.\u00a0 Even though I\u2019d been able to dress up for the occasion (in a dress with pockets, no less!), it had felt strange to be back in this constrained environment having become used to the freedom many of us have begun to enjoy as restrictions ease.</p>\n\n<p>A week earlier I had been standing on various stages at the Intra-Africa Trade Fair in Durban, attended by around 15,000 people with renewed optimism.

Both engine options will come with the newly created direct Shift-10AT (10-speed automatic transmission). This will offer smoother power delivery, resulting in less fatigue when behind the wheel.\n\nApart from the new engine, additional features in the 300 series include wheel articulation and the Electronic Kinetic Dynamic Suspension System (E-KDSS). A wheel articulation feature is a number that indicates the ability of a tire to stay on the ground. The E-KDSS system is the first in the world to improve road holding.\n\nMr. Arvinder Reel further noted \u2018\u2019The frame redesign reduces weight and increases the rigidity of the suspension. These improvements have led to a significant reduction in body weight of approximately 200 kg and ensure the best driving experience.

To cushion farmers [\u2026]", "articleBody": "As climate change worsens, millions of smallholder farmers across sub-Saharan Africa grapple with unprecedented weather changes and influxes of pests and diseases that ravage their farms and devastate their livelihoods. However, a climate-smart crop insurance scheme introduced in Kenya combines satellite data and smartphone imagery to provide farmers with much needed protection.\n\nTo cushion farmers against climate change and boost productivity and resilience, governments and private sector players have been exploring various financing solutions. Among them is index-based weather insurance, which relies on satellite images to determine if a particular area \u2013 sometimes covering up to 1,000 farmers \u2013 has been affected by harsh weather, such as excess rainfall or drought. When impacted by extreme weather, farmers registered with the scheme automatically receive a payout.\n\nHowever, although the insurance scheme has proven popular, there have been challenges as a result of the model used to determine payouts. For instance, while the satellite images provide a general view of wide geographical areas, they do not measure rainfall or drought levels at localized or specific areas. This can lead to farmers not receiving the payouts they need. Smallholders are also expected to pay for visits by \u2018loss assessors\u2019, who determine if payouts are required by traveling to the farms \u2013 and for many, this has made index-based insurance too expensive.\n\nDeveloping a better picture\n\nInspired by the need to create a solution to provide more localized information in the event of weather-induced crop catastrophes, Agriculture and Climate Risk Enterprise (ACRE Africa) has introduced a climate-smart crop insurance scheme combining satellite data and smartphone imagery. The initiative is part of the Cultivate Africa\u2019s Future (CultiAF) program, which is jointly funded by the International Development Research Centre and the Australian Centre for International Agriculture Research.\n\nDubbed \u2018picture-based insurance\u2019 (PBI), the scheme requires farmer champions to periodically take photos on behalf of farmers\u2019 crops at different growth stages \u2013 including at planting, mid-season, and before and after harvesting. This data is then used by insurance companies and associated agronomists to determine whether a farmer is eligible for a payout and, if so, how much. To make the scheme sustainable, PBI also provides farmers with access to high-quality certified seeds, input financing, agricultural advice, and agronomist-led information on regional weather conditions.\n\n\u201cThrough the use of satellite and smartphone imagery, and providing eyes on the ground to observe farm management practices, the PBI scheme addresses the challenges of basis risk, discrepancies between insurance pay-outs and actual farmer losses, and ultimately, poor trust in insurers among farmers. PBI also promotes the adoption of resilient farming technologies and works to better engage smallholder farmers which helps to further improve trust,\u201d says Lilian Waithaka, PBI project manager.\n\nTo ensure that PBI works on the ground, the scheme relies on \u2018village champions\u2019, who are trained on the various aspects of insurance, why crops should be insured, and how different agronomic practices, such as mulching, can increase their yields. These champions pass on their newfound knowledge and skills to other farmers, with the aim of persuading them to take up the insurance product.\n\nFarmers can sign up to PBI by simply dialing a USSD code on their phones. Payments for the insurance premiums are also completed on their mobiles, using the MPESA payment service, which range in price from Ksh50 (CAD 0.56/AUD 0.61) to Ksh1,000 (CAD 11.25/AUD 12.25). Once any payouts are triggered and verified, the money is sent directly to the farmers\u2019 MPESA account.\n\nBetting on champion farmers to increase insurance uptake\n\nIn the Bungoma and Busia counties of western Kenya, where the project is currently being rolled out, 6,000 maize, beans and sorghum farmers have registered with the insurance scheme. Sixty champion farmers have worked hard to lead the initiative in the two counties. \u201cWhen we launched this project in 2019, the initial idea was for each champion farmer to have 250 farmers in their network. They had even collected all the farmers\u2019 details,\u201d says Patyster Lusweti, ACRE Africa supervisor. \u201cThen COVID-19 struck, and we were forced to reduce to between 20 and 40 per champion farmer to adhere to guidelines on reduced movement and social distancing.\u201d\n\nJohn Poi Namanjelie is a champion farmer in Bungoma County. He practices mixed farming \u2013 growing vegetables, fruits, maize, beans, bananas, and sorghum \u2013 on his 1.2 ha farm to build his climate resilience, but was previously only producing enough for home consumption. Since embracing PBI, John has been able to increase his yields and start selling his produce. He also trains other farmers on good management practices, and the importance of insuring their seeds. \u201cFarmers in the area have warmed up to the idea of this insurance, mostly because they have seen the payouts happening and because we, their fellow farmers, are the ones selling the insurance,\u201d he explains.\n\nAdopting PBI has also provided an unexpected benefit for Mary Nasimiyu, a young farmer also in Bungoma County. With access to higher-quality maize seeds as part of the PBI scheme, Mary has improved her yields, which has enabled her to sell her produce at local markets, diversify into vegetable farming, and even set up her own clothing boutique. She has also recruited other young people, the majority of whom had resisted going into farming due to low yields. \u201cDue to crop diversification and with new ways of farming, I have received a lot of requests from young people who are keen to join farming,\u201d Mary says. \u201cI am happy of the small revolution that we are together creating in encouraging more youth to farm.\u201d\n\nAs more farmers take up this insurance, there has been growing demand to increase the crops covered and to introduce more inputs to the scheme. \u201cWe recently did a survey on farmers\u2019 willingness to purchase other inputs, such as fertilizer and crop protection products, including pesticides and herbicides, if these are incorporated into the insurance scheme,\u201d shares Patyster. \u201cA huge percentage of the farmers welcomed the idea and stated they would be willing to invest.\u201d\n\nMary adds that farmer\u2019s interests are also extending to other areas. \u201cIn my interaction with farmers, especially the young ones, there have been calls to increase the range of crops that can be insured to include horticulture.\u201d", "articleBodyHtml": "<article>\n\n<figure><img src=\"https://thedailymail.co.ke/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/Picture-based-insurance-cushion-Kenyan-smallholder-farmers-from-climate-change1-696x463.jpeg\" srcset=\"https://thedailymail.co.ke/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/Picture-based-insurance-cushion-Kenyan-smallholder-farmers-from-climate-change1-696x463.jpeg 696w, https://thedailymail.co.ke/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/Picture-based-insurance-cushion-Kenyan-smallholder-farmers-from-climate-change1.jpeg 1392w\" sizes=\"(-webkit-min-device-pixel-ratio: 2) 1392px, (min-resolution: 192dpi) 1392px, 696px\" alt=\"\" title=\"Picture-based insurance cushion Kenyan smallholder farmers from climate change1\"></figure>\n\n<p><strong>As climate change worsens, millions of smallholder farmers across sub-Saharan Africa grapple with unprecedented weather changes and influxes of pests and diseases that ravage their farms and devastate their livelihoods.

There is a myriad of challenges that will bring one down within a blink of an eye. Any avenue that cushions entrepreneurs against a fall and maximizes their profits is worth rushing for.\n\nEntrepreneurship is often categorized under micro and small businesses. These micro and small businesses form the backbone of emerging economies by generating income, creating employment, and contributing to economic growth.\n\nStats from the International Labor Organization (ILO) indicate that small and micro businesses generate about 90 percent of employment opportunities in Sub-Sharan Africa.\n\nThe above stats are true given that in Kenya, for instance, according to the Kenya National Bureau of Statistics (KNBS), micro and small businesses employ about 86 percent of the population and contribute about 45.5 percent to the gross domestic product (GDP).\n\nThere is no doubt that micro retail outlets are an essential source of basic goods and services for vulnerable communities and serve as a vital link in food supply chains. In most economies in Africa, these outlets play a huge role in enabling financial inclusion.\n\nFaced with so many challenges, many entrepreneurs in Africa often have no one to walk with them. They are abandoned by financial providers, especially commercial banks because they are considered high-risk customers.\n\nWith little help from other players, TechnoServe came in to help micro and small retailers in Kenya, Nigeria, C\u00f4te d\u2019Ivoire, and Tanzania improve the operations and profitability of their stores to enable them to increase their income and maximize their economic potential.\n\nSo far, TechnoServe has worked with 24,095 micro-entrepreneurs across these countries in partnership with Citi Foundation, Elea Foundation, The Mastercard Center, Mastercard Foundation, and the Moody\u2019s Foundation.\n\nThrough the delivery of a combination of in-shop advisory services and group training, TechnoServe has helped more than 24,000 small shops to increase their sales and profits and create jobs.\n\nThrough the programs, they have helped store owners to form business groups that facilitate bulk ordering and direct linkages to suppliers and manufacturers as well as addressing access to finance constraints, through rotating savings and credit associations and mutual credit guarantees.\n\nMany small businesses fail when they fail to embrace technology. They end up locking themselves into a vacuum, away from the real world. The truth is, technology can be particularly transformative in this sector and has piloted digital technologies that help shop owners manage inventory, sales, and finances.\n\nThrough programs such as Smart Duka, TechnoServe has been able to increase the profitability of over 1,000 high potential shops in Kenya\u2019s capital, Nairobi. At the same time, through the Pan-African Youth Entrepreneur Development, TechnoServe is spreading wings within other markets.", "articleBodyHtml": "<article>\n\n<figure><img src=\"https://thedailymail.co.ke/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/Technoserve-Helping-Entrepreneurs-In-Kenya-Nigeria-Co%CC%82te-dIvoire-And-Tanzania-Maximize-Their-Profitability-696x464.jpeg\" srcset=\"https://thedailymail.co.ke/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/Technoserve-Helping-Entrepreneurs-In-Kenya-Nigeria-Co\u0302te-dIvoire-And-Tanzania-Maximize-Their-Profitability-696x464.jpeg 696w, https://thedailymail.co.ke/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/Technoserve-Helping-Entrepreneurs-In-Kenya-Nigeria-Co\u0302te-dIvoire-And-Tanzania-Maximize-Their-Profitability.jpeg 1392w\" sizes=\"(-webkit-min-device-pixel-ratio: 2) 1392px, (min-resolution: 192dpi) 1392px, 696px\" alt=\"\" title=\"Technoserve; Helping Entrepreneurs In Kenya, Nigeria, Co\u0302te d\u2019Ivoire, And Tanzania Maximize Their Profitability\"></figure>\n\n<p>Entrepreneurship is like a long and treacherous journey.

They are abandoned by financial providers, especially commercial banks because they are considered high-risk customers.</p>\n\n<p>With little help from other players, TechnoServe came in to help micro and small retailers in Kenya, Nigeria, C\u00f4te d\u2019Ivoire, and Tanzania improve the operations and profitability of their stores to enable them to increase their income and maximize their economic potential.</p>\n\n<p>So far, TechnoServe has worked with 24,095 micro-entrepreneurs across these countries in partnership with Citi Foundation, Elea Foundation, The Mastercard Center, Mastercard Foundation, and the Moody\u2019s Foundation.</p>\n\n<p>Through the delivery of a combination of in-shop advisory services and group training, TechnoServe has helped more than 24,000 small shops to increase their sales and profits and create jobs.</p>\n\n<p>Through the programs, they have helped store owners to form business groups that facilitate bulk ordering and direct linkages to suppliers and manufacturers as well as addressing access to finance constraints, through rotating savings and credit associations and mutual credit guarantees.</p>\n\n<p>Many small businesses fail when they fail to embrace technology. They end up locking themselves into a vacuum, away from the real world. The truth is, technology can be particularly transformative in this sector and has piloted digital technologies that help shop owners manage inventory, sales, and finances.</p>\n\n<p>Through programs such as Smart Duka, TechnoServe has been able to increase the profitability of over 1,000 high potential shops in Kenya\u2019s capital, Nairobi. At the same time, through the Pan-African Youth Entrepreneur Development, TechnoServe is spreading wings within other markets.</p>\n\n</article>", "canonicalUrl": "https://thedailymail.co.ke/technoserve-helping-entrepreneurs-in-kenya-nigeria-cote-divoire-and-tanzania-maximize-their-profitability/"},{"url": "https://thedailymail.co.ke/mastercard-foundation-and-africa-cdcs-delivers-first-tranche-of-over-15-million-vaccines/", "probability": 0.98933315, "headline": "Mastercard Foundation and Africa CDC\u2019s delivers first tranche of over 15 million vaccines", "datePublished": "2021-11-26T09:54:04+00:00", "datePublishedRaw": "2021-11-26T09:54:04+00:00", "dateModified": "2021-11-26T09:54:54+00:00", "dateModifiedRaw": "2021-11-26T09:54:54+00:00", "author": "admin", "authorsList": ["admin"], "inLanguage": "en", "breadcrumbs": [{"name": "Home", "link": "https://thedailymail.co.ke/"}, {"name": "Business", "link": "https://thedailymail.co.ke/category/business/"}, {"name": "Mastercard Foundation and Africa CDC\u2019s delivers first tranche of over 15 million...", "link": "https://thedailymail.co.ke/mastercard-foundation-and-africa-cdcs-delivers-first-tranche-of-over-15-million-vaccines/"}], "mainImage": "https://thedailymail.co.ke/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/Mastercard-Foundation-and-Africa-CDCs-delivers-first-tranche-of-over-15-million-vaccines.jpeg", "images": ["https://thedailymail.co.ke/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/Mastercard-Foundation-and-Africa-CDCs-delivers-first-tranche-of-over-15-million-vaccines-696x500.jpeg"], "description": "The Mastercard Foundation and Africa CDC jointly announced that 15.2 million vaccines purchased under the\u00a0Saving Lives and Livelihoods initiative are currently being distributed across Africa.

As [\u2026]", "articleBody": "Livestock farmers in sub-Saharan Africa have grappled with an incessant price rise of animal feeds in recent years \u2013 caused by the scarcity and high cost of ingredients, namely, cereals, soybean, and fishmeal. The incorporation of human foods, such as fish and meat, within conventional animal feeds, has put a strain on their availability. As a result, feeds constitute an estimated 70 percent of input costs in poultry and fish production. This, at a time when the Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations estimates that the world will have to produce 200 million tonnes more meat by 2050 to feed a projected global population of 9.1 billion. The need for alternative, cost-effective, and environmentally-friendly animal feed protein sources, is clear.\n\nAware of this fact, the Insect Feed for Poultry, Fish and Pig Production (INSFEED) project has been exploring the use of insects, such as black soldier flies (BSF) and crickets, within animal feeds. Comprising high levels of protein, fat, minerals, and amino acids, these insects offer a suitable, nutritious substitute to commercial feed protein sources. And there are more benefits: according to a study by the International Centre of Insect Physiology and Ecology (ICIPE), replacing five to 50 percent of the fish meal and maize in conventional animal feeds with insects would avail enough protein to feed between 470,000 and 4.8 million people \u2013 in just one year. The establishment of an insect-for-feed value chain would also create between 2,500 and 3,000 jobs annually, thus helping reduce poverty among some of the world\u2019s poorest.\n\nSince the project\u2019s launch and first phase, which started in 2014, and the second phase from 2017, the INSFEED project has promoted and increased the rearing, harvesting, processing and use of insects in fish and poultry feed among 57,000 farmers in Kenya and Uganda. Over 100 small- and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs) have also been engaged with the project. These SMEs now produce up to three tonnes of fresh BSF larvae per week, and over 1,200 jobs \u2013 particularly for women and youth \u2013 have been created through the establishment of these enterprises.\n\nTo streamline the value chain and further open up markets for the entrepreneurs, the project has developed feed standards for both countries. These guidelines have enhanced the production, processing, and handling of insects and their by-products, and have created an opportunity for mass insect production and marketing.\n\n\u201cThese standards, the first to be developed in Africa, are a milestone in supporting farmers and industry players who are interested in farming insects. With this code of practice, insect farmers, harvesters, and processing industries can now get accreditation, and their products will be issued with a KEBS [Kenya Bureau of Food Standards] certificate enabling them to market and sell their products in local markets and beyond the country,\u201d explains Peter Mutua, KEBS manager.\n\nINSFEED is among eight other projects under the Cultivate Africa\u2019s Future Fund, a joint initiative of the Australian Centre for International Agricultural Research, and Canada\u2019s International Development Research Centre. Implemented by ICIPE, the insect initiative is being run in partnership with governments, the private sector and cooperatives.\n\nInvesting in bug business\n\nThe project has worked with women, women groups, and youth to grow their capacity to rear and process insects, and sell them for livestock feeds. Doreen Mbaya Ariwi, one such entrepreneur, now produces enough BSF to feed over 6,000 chickens (of different ages) on her poultry farm. With training in insect production and an initial BSF stock of 5 kg from ICIPE, Ariwi breeds the insects across 3,000 trays in three greenhouses (also provided by ICIPE). She also supplies a surplus of 220 kg BSF to a local company that manufactures insect-based pet food. For 1 kg of BSF, Ariwi charges Ksh320 (CA$3.56/AU$3.86), earning her an additional income stream.\n\nEmbracing BSF farming has also enabled Ariwi to reduce the amount of commercial feed she uses. Since May 2021, she has bought 300 bags per month instead of 450 bags, thanks to supplementation with insects, which she feeds to the chickens directly or mixes with conventional feeds. This has resulted in a saving of 30%.\n\n\u201cIt would have been very difficult for us to keep the chickens we have without the support of the insects. The integrated farming method has been remarkable. The insects and chickens are interdependent. The BSF feed on chicken manure and, once the insects mature, we feed them to the chickens. There is zero waste, which is one of our missions at the farm. As we push for sustainable and greener communities, insects have assisted us in achieving that goal,\u201d she says.\n\nA group of 100 Kenyan youth, all in their early 20s, has also delved into insect rearing to meet the burgeoning demand for alternative protein sources from farmers and companies. On 0.1 acre of land provided by one of the youth\u2019s parents, the group, called Y Minds Connect, are able to rear BSF larvae in 1,500 crates, with each crate accommodating 3 kg of larvae.\n\n\u201cWe believe that one man\u2019s waste is another man\u2019s treasure, and that is why we have been keen to pursue insect farming. Working on a project at a low cost that helps the community and the environment is profitable, and is fulfilling. Feeds account for an estimated 70% of the cost of raising livestock, and we have been mesmerized by the potential of BSF to address this challenge,\u201d enthuses 24-year-old Nicholas Mareve, CEO of Y Minds Connect.\n\nY Minds Connect produces 600 kg of BSF faeces (\u2018frass\u2019) every week, which they sell as fertilizer to horticulture, flower, and organic farmers at Ksh100 (CA$1.15/AU$1.24) per 1 kg. The group earns additional income from the training it provides to women and youth groups in insect rearing and production. Depending on the number of attendees, these sessions range from Ksh2,000 (CA$22/AU$23) to Ksh5,000 (CA$56/AU$60) in cost.\n\n\u201cWe train SMEs in how to handle each insect stage for better productivity, then give the enterprises their initial stock. Some have produced the insects for their own use, whilst others have partnered with companies to supply to them,\u201d says Dr Chrysantus Tanga, INSFEED project leader and ICIPE research scientist. He adds that the insect rearing value chain has also created new enterprises, with youth and women making insect \u2018nests\u2019, in which the insects reproduce, as well as greenhouse structures to sell to farmers.\n\nAs more farmers learn how to rear insects for feed, and SMEs work directly with feed millers to supply them, an insect-rearing revolution is set to take off in sub-Saharan Africa. Other countries, including Rwanda, are now in the process of introducing standards to streamline insect rearing, and to help address the twin problems of feed shortages and price hikes.", "articleBodyHtml": "<article>\n\n<figure><img src=\"https://thedailymail.co.ke/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/Nicholas-Mareve-CEO-of-Y-Minds-Connect-started-BSF-breeding-to-access-a-better-livelihood-696x463.jpeg\" srcset=\"https://thedailymail.co.ke/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/Nicholas-Mareve-CEO-of-Y-Minds-Connect-started-BSF-breeding-to-access-a-better-livelihood-696x463.jpeg 696w, https://thedailymail.co.ke/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/Nicholas-Mareve-CEO-of-Y-Minds-Connect-started-BSF-breeding-to-access-a-better-livelihood.jpeg 1392w\" sizes=\"(-webkit-min-device-pixel-ratio: 2) 1392px, (min-resolution: 192dpi) 1392px, 696px\" alt=\"\" title=\"Nicholas Mareve, CEO of Y Minds Connect, started BSF breeding to access a better livelihood\"><figcaption>Nicholas Mareve, CEO of Y Minds Connect, started BSF breeding to access a better livelihood</figcaption></figure>\n\n<p>Livestock farmers in sub-Saharan Africa have grappled with an incessant price rise of animal feeds in recent years \u2013 caused by the scarcity and high cost of ingredients, namely, cereals, soybean, and fishmeal.

Built by Mubiru, the park started life as little more than a single halfpipe. Now, more than 300 children learn to skate there and Mubiru jokes that he is the \u201cgrandfather\u201d of the sport, \u201cMost of the people when they hear grandpa they think of grey hair. But no, a grandfather, that is knowledge. So, for me, I am a grandfather of skateboarding in East Africa because I introduced it, nobody knew about the sport.\u201d\n\nMubiru\u2019s skateboarding journey began in 2005. While binge-watching TV, he stumbled upon legendary American skateboarder Tony Hawk. He says that he had never seen anything like this before and it inspired him to start skateboarding, \u201cI was like, I need to know how can someone jump with a board without\u2026 ahh! I thought that maybe this is magic.\u201d\n\nA year later, Mubiru had a chance encounter at the mall with South African skater Shael Swart. The two quickly struck up a friendship, which would eventually lead to the construction of the Kitintale Skatepark.\n\nFollowing its completion, the original halfpipe structure drew the attention of locals and quickly became a favourite pastime for children in the slum. Mubiru explains that, to start with, there were many accidents at the park, \u201cAccidents were many because we had no protective gear, no helmets. You know, for us, we used to skate barefooted you step on the board and you have only one board. Our first skate pipe, we wrote, the word, \u2018skate at your own risk\u2019 because many guys they got injuries.\u201d\n\nFifteen years later, and the skatepark has evolved into the most prominent feature in the Kitintale slum, empowering children in the community and inspiring the next generation of pro-skateboarders in Uganda. Kyomuhendo Peter, a skateboarder and coach at the park, describes why he loves the sport, \u201cSkateboarding has like the biggest life lesson on a person, it impacts a mindset. Like, whenever you fall down you have to get back up, you don\u2019t give up, every time you do a trick. For me, whenever I do a trick and fall down, I keep on pushing until I learn the trick. So that\u2019s how life is.\u201d\n\nThe children who skate at Kitintale have been able to participate in several international skating competitions in countries including South Africa, Kenya, Namibia, and Germany. Mubiru now hopes to bring more girls into the sport, and thanks to his daughters who are following in his footsteps, he has the perfect female role models, \u201cMy daughters, they are inspiring more girls to be part of skateboarding. How? When they skate, other girls say \u2018Imagine, even a girl!\u2019 So, they join them. So, my kids, they are advertising the Uganda Skateboard Union, that girls we can also do it.\u201d\n\nHowever, the high cost of importing equipment remains a major challenge to the sport. This hardship has inspired Mubiru\u2019s latest dream, \u201cI have a dream which is to start my own plant to manufacture skateboards. Right now, we are importing them from Europe. I want Uganda to be part of the skateboard culture, Uganda to start manufacturing their own skateboards.\u201d\n\nFrom its humble beginnings as a lone halfpipe, the skatepark has evolved into a diversified social enterprise. As well as running classes for jewellery-making, fashion, tailoring and bamboo creations, the Kitintale Skatepark has become one of the biggest dance talent hubs in the country. Mubiru speaks about offering these extracurricular activities at the skatepark, \u201cIt\u2019s connected to the skatepark because when the kids after skating, we keep them to do other things. We teach them to do other stuff so that they can create their own things. These kids, they have their own benefits like when they are going back to school, they need books, so we sell these and then we get books and also some school fees for them.\u201d\n\nIt\u2019s an exciting time for skateboarders around the world, as the sport recently made its debut at the Tokyo 2020 Olympics Games. After seeing the impact that just one skateboard park can have, Mubiru tells Okpo that his dream is to construct parks across Africa, \u201cI would love to have professional skateboarders come to Africa to see what is Africa, because people they do not know the interior of Africa. If you talk about Africa, they know adventure, you go visit lions. And what they need to come and see is not only adventures, come and see the sport which is in Africa.\u201d\n\nThis week\u2019s episode also meets pro-climber Peter Naituli, who is increasing opportunities for Kenyans to get involved in the climbing community. He speaks about the importance of outdoor activities to help conservation efforts, \u201cIn Kenya, we\u2019re blessed with a lot of beautiful nature and we need to give people a reason to preserve this nature. And outdoor recreation is the go-to way, a good reason that we can preserve and look after these environments. And that is why we want to inspire people to get into outdoor recreation.

The contract price was Kshs.173,374,325.709. Part of the agreement [\u2026]", "articleBody": "By Steve Mwangi, Director Steam & Petroleum Ltd\n\nSteam and Petroleum Ltd, a company in which I am a director, entered into a joint venture with Source Logistics in May 2019 to construct an RTG Runway Beam at Embakasi ICD for the Kenya Ports Authority (KPA). The contract price was Kshs.173,374,325.709.\n\nPart of the agreement was that Steam and Petroleum and the Source Logistics would own interests in the joint venture at the ratio of 82.5 percent and 17.5 percent respectively and any profit/losses and liabilities that would arise thereof would be shared in that ratio.\n\nTo ensure a smooth-running, both parties agreed that the funds received in connection with the performance of the contract would specifically be deposited in a \u201cChecking Account\u201d which was later opened at Transnational Bank (now Access Bank), Nyerere Avenue Branch Mombasa, as Account No.32876002 in the name of Source Logistic East Africa Limited.\n\nWithdrawals from that account would require the joint signature of both parties and its operations would be separate from any other account owned by either Steam and Petroleum or Source Logistics.\n\nHowever, parties further executed a special power of attorney dated 22nd January 2020 and it was agreed that the proceeds from the KPA would be deposited in the \u201cChecking Account\u201d Account No.32876002 and the Source and Petroleum\u2019s Director would be the sole signatory for that purpose.\n\nTrouble began when invoices were sent to KPA for Kshs.34,723,935.07 and Kshs.25,000,000/= respectively whose proceeds were to be paid through the \u201cChecking Account\u201d No.32876002 held at the Transnational Bank.\n\nWithout its knowledge, the Source Logistics director one Mr. James Daniel Dena while in fraudulent collusion with the employees KPA, caused the invoices in the sum of Kshs.54,723,935.07 to be paid through Account N0.1380265181582 held at the Equity Bank Limited in the name of Source Logistics East Africa Limited which is solely operated by Mr. Dena.\n\nThis breached the terms of the joint venture by not paying the monies realized from the KPA contract therein in the agreed \u201cChecking Account\u201d No.32876002 at the Transnational Bank. The aim was to deprive Steam and Petroleum Ltd its rightful dues.\n\nSteam and Petroleum then sought the Court to grant an injunction restraining the Source Logistics from interfering with the said sum of Kshs.54,723,935.07 held in its Equity Bank and further be compelled to transfer the same to the \u201cChecking Account\u201d No.32876002 at Transnational Bank as initially agreed.\n\nThe Court gave an order directing the transfer of Kshs.54,723,935.07 held in Account No.1380265181582 in Equity Bank Limited held to Source Logistics East Africa Limited to Account No.32876002 Transnational Bank, Nyerere Avenue Branch, Mombasa in the name of Source Logistics East Africa Limited.\n\nBut only Ksh 27,608,900 was transferred from the Equity Account into the Trans National account. Meanwhile, I had already given 4 RTGS directions which were reversed without my knowledge leading to my arrest as one of the beneficiaries was a car dealer who suspected I had tried to defraud him.\n\nSomehow third parties were able to get a court order to remove the exact amount that was in the Trans National Bank account which is clearly an inside job as only I and the Bank\u2019s management would know the account\u2019s status.\n\nSince then, I have faced financial struggles and my character has been marred due to the RTGS reversals. What is worrying is that despite numerous attempts to contact the management of both banks, nothing has materialized.\n\nSome of the main concerns are:\n\n1.

The contract price was Kshs.173,374,325.709.</p>\n\n<p>Part of the agreement was that Steam and Petroleum and the Source Logistics would own interests in the joint venture at the ratio of 82.5 percent and 17.5 percent respectively and any profit/losses and liabilities that would arise thereof would be shared in that ratio.</p>\n\n<p>To ensure a smooth-running, both parties agreed that the funds received in connection with the performance of the contract would specifically be deposited in a \u201cChecking Account\u201d which was later opened at Transnational Bank (now Access Bank), Nyerere Avenue Branch Mombasa, as Account No.32876002 in the name of Source Logistic East Africa Limited.</p>\n\n<p>Withdrawals from that account would require the joint signature of both parties and its operations would be separate from any other account owned by either Steam and Petroleum or Source Logistics.</p>\n\n<p>However, parties further executed a special power of attorney dated 22nd January 2020 and it was agreed that the proceeds from the KPA would be deposited in the \u201cChecking Account\u201d Account No.32876002 and the Source and Petroleum\u2019s Director would be the sole signatory for that purpose.</p>\n\n<p>Trouble began when invoices were sent to KPA for Kshs.34,723,935.07 and Kshs.25,000,000/= respectively whose proceeds were to be paid through the \u201cChecking Account\u201d\u00a0No.32876002\u00a0held at the\u00a0Transnational Bank.</p>\n\n<p>Without its knowledge, the Source Logistics director one\u00a0Mr. James Daniel Dena while in fraudulent collusion with the employees KPA, caused the invoices in the sum of Kshs.54,723,935.07 to be paid through\u00a0Account N0.1380265181582\u00a0held at the\u00a0Equity Bank Limited\u00a0in the name of\u00a0Source Logistics East Africa Limited\u00a0which is solely operated by Mr. Dena.</p>\n\n<p>This breached the terms of the joint venture by not paying the monies realized from the KPA contract therein in the agreed \u201cChecking Account\u201d No.32876002\u00a0at the\u00a0Transnational Bank. The\u00a0aim was to deprive Steam\u00a0and Petroleum Ltd its rightful dues.</p>\n\n<p>Steam\u00a0and Petroleum then sought the Court to grant an injunction restraining the Source Logistics from interfering with the said sum of Kshs.54,723,935.07 held in its\u00a0Equity Bank\u00a0and further be compelled to transfer the same to the \u201cChecking Account\u201d No.32876002\u00a0at\u00a0Transnational Bank as initially agreed.</p>\n\n<p>The Court gave\u00a0an order directing the transfer of Kshs.54,723,935.07 held in\u00a0Account No.1380265181582\u00a0in\u00a0Equity Bank Limited held to Source Logistics East Africa Limited\u00a0to\u00a0Account No.32876002 Transnational\u00a0\u00a0Bank, Nyerere Avenue Branch, Mombasa in the name of Source Logistics East Africa Limited.</p>\n\n<p>But only Ksh 27,608,900 was transferred from the Equity Account into the Trans National account. Meanwhile, I had already given 4 RTGS directions which were reversed without my knowledge leading to my arrest as one of the beneficiaries was a car dealer who suspected I had tried to defraud him.</p>\n\n<p>Somehow third parties were able to get a court order to remove the exact amount that was in the Trans National Bank account which is clearly an inside job as only I and the Bank\u2019s management would know the account\u2019s status.</p>\n\n<p>Since then, I have faced financial struggles and my character has been marred due to the RTGS reversals. What is worrying is that despite numerous attempts to contact the management of both banks, nothing has materialized.</p>\n\n<p>Some of the main concerns are:</p>\n\n<p>1. Why did Equity Bank not transfer the whole amount as directed by the Court?</p>\n\n<ol start=\"2\"><li>What is the status of the balanced funds?</li>\n<li>Why were the 4 RTGS orders given to Access Bank not executed?</li>\n<li>Why was I not informed about the new court orders that saw funds in the account to which I am a signatory disappear?</li>\n<li>How could third parties know the exact amount that was in the account?</li></ol>\n\n<p>I speak on behalf of Kenyans who are suffering and who will continue to suffer if the rot in the banking system is not fixed.</p>\n\n<p>I urge the Central Bank of Kenya, the Capital Markets Authority and the Directorate of Criminal Investigation to look into this matter urgently.

I want to hone my skills by competing in more tournaments and create an awareness of E-Sports and the growth of it as a career path for our youth.\u201d said the 21 years old James Merigi.\n\nDuring the finale, the contestants battled each other across several intense rounds through tactical play and strategy.

In fact, Covid-19 cases have multiplied in Tokyo since the Olympics started.\n\nAthletes in both events have had to cope with pandemic-induced obstacles: finding creative ways to train when facilities shut down, coping with the mental stress of training for an extra year amid questions of whether the Games would go on at all, and competing in Tokyo without family in the stands.\n\nBut for the more than 4,000 Paralympic athletes at these Games, the pandemic is just one part of a long journey marked by unbelievable odds, be it severe health challenges, childhood illness, or life-changing injuries from the war. Behind every Paralympian is an extraordinary story of perseverance triumphing constant hardship. After every conversation, I\u2019ve had with a Paralympian, I\u2019m reminded of the resilience of the human spirit, even after tumult, agony and trauma.\n\nTake Brad Snyder, who became the first U.S. man \u2013 Olympic or Paralympic \u2013 to win gold in a triathlon event. He was in the Navy\u2019s elite bomb disposal unit for seven years, serving in Iraq & Afghanistan. He was completely blinded after stepping on an improvised explosive device in Afghanistan in 2011.\n\n\u201cI thought that I had died, I thought there was no way that I had lived through it,\u201d he told me. \u201cBut I did, and I wound up in a hospital bed, and I think everybody in the room\u2026was really devastated by the idea I wouldn\u2019t be able to see. I was really thankful to still be alive. And I think that perspective is what got me through the initial steps of adjusting to a new life without vision.\u201d\n\nSnyder said he pushed through moments of frustrations \u2014 when he wished he could see for just a moment to do a simple task like the dishes \u2013 by telling himself, \u201cyou are lucky to be alive and you should be grateful for the things that you have.\u201d\n\nThat mindset is also what motivated triathlete Melissa Stockwell, who lost her left leg in the Iraq War when a roadside bomb exploded while she was leading a convoy in Baghdad. She was 24 at the time.\n\n\u201cMy life changed in a second, but it\u2019s all about perspective\u2026seeing other soldiers who had significantly worse injuries, and I thought all I lost is one leg. Now let\u2019s get back to living and see what I can still do,\u201d Stockwell said. \u201cI didn\u2019t want to let losing a leg stop me from doing anything that I wanted to do.\u201d\n\nOn top of the challenges of training during the pandemic, Stockwell fractured her back in a severe bike crash weeks before the Paralympics. \u201cIt\u2019s amazing that I can be there at the start line,\u201d she said. \u201cIt could have been so much worse.\u201d\n\nFor 18-time Paralympic medalist Tatyana McFadden, the arduous journey to Tokyo was a continuation of a lifetime of setbacks. She said if I\u2019d asked her two years ago whether she\u2019d be competing in Tokyo 2020, she would\u2019ve been doubtful. She was diagnosed with a rare blood clotting disorder in 2017. Even after several surgeries, the clots \u201ckept coming back and they kept traveling.\u201d She outlined a 20-month journey to rid her body of the problem, including the lymphedema that happened as a result.\n\nMcFadden attributes her harsh childhood as part of the reason why she has become so strong mentally and physically. Born in Russia with spina bifida, she spent the first six years of her life in a St. Petersburg orphanage. With no medical assistance or wheelchair, she taught herself how to walk on her hands.\n\n\u201cI think it came from learning how to survive in the conditions that I was in and having that will to live to the next day, to the next day, to the next day,\u201d said McFadden, who was later adopted by her American mother.\n\nIt\u2019s not just these Paralympian\u2019s mental fortitude and determination that strikes me, but also the contagious positivity that they exude. Paralympic swimmer Haven Shepherd tells me the trauma of her past is a source of gratitude, rather than sorrow.\n\nBorn in Vietnam, Shepherd said she\u2019s the child of parents who had an affair and were unable to be together. \u201cFor their circumstance they thought the best thing was to commit a family suicide,\u201d she said. When Shepherd was 14 months old, her parents held her between them and detonated a suicide bomb.\n\n\u201cI was blown 40 feet away from the accident, and all the damage was done to my legs,\u201d Shepherd said. \u201cI just think it\u2019s such a miracle that, you know, I survived\u2026and then I was adopted later when I was 20 months old.\u201d\n\n18-year-old Shepherd said she thinks of her biological mom\u2019s act as a sacrifice that led her to have \u201can amazing childhood\u201d. Shepherd smiles broadly as she describes her big family in the Midwest: loving parents, four sisters and two brothers. Shepherd, who mentors other amputees, said she\u2019s confident in showing her prosthetic legs and telling others \u201chow fulfilled my life is by not having legs.\u201d\n\nMany Paralympians also have underlying health conditions, putting them at greater risk if they were to be infected with Covid-19.

In fact, Covid-19 cases have multiplied in Tokyo since the Olympics started.</p>\n\n<p>Athletes in both events have had to cope with pandemic-induced obstacles: finding creative ways to train when facilities shut down, coping with the mental stress of training for an extra year amid questions of whether the Games would go on at all, and competing in Tokyo without family in the stands.</p>\n\n<p>But for the more than 4,000 Paralympic athletes at these Games, the pandemic is just one part of a long journey marked by unbelievable odds, be it severe health challenges, childhood illness, or life-changing injuries from the war. Behind every Paralympian is an extraordinary story of perseverance triumphing constant hardship. After every conversation, I\u2019ve had with a Paralympian, I\u2019m reminded of the resilience of the human spirit, even after tumult, agony and trauma.</p>\n\n<p>Take Brad Snyder, who became the first U.S. man \u2013 Olympic or Paralympic \u2013 to win gold in a triathlon event.\u00a0 He was in the Navy\u2019s elite bomb disposal unit for seven years, serving in Iraq &amp; Afghanistan. He was completely blinded after stepping on an improvised explosive device in Afghanistan in 2011.</p>\n\n<p>\u201cI thought that I had died, I thought there was no way that I had lived through it,\u201d he told me. \u201cBut I did, and I wound up in a hospital bed, and I think everybody in the room\u2026was really devastated by the idea I wouldn\u2019t be able to see. I was really thankful to still be alive. And I think that perspective is what got me through the initial steps of adjusting to a new life without vision.\u201d</p>\n\n<p>Snyder said he pushed through moments of frustrations \u2014 when he wished he could see for just a moment to do a simple task like the dishes \u2013 by telling himself, \u201cyou are lucky to be alive and you should be grateful for the things that you have.\u201d</p>\n\n<p>That mindset is also what motivated triathlete Melissa Stockwell, who lost her left leg in the Iraq War when a roadside bomb exploded while she was leading a convoy in Baghdad. She was 24 at the time.</p>\n\n<p>\u201cMy life changed in a second, but it\u2019s all about perspective\u2026seeing other soldiers who had significantly worse injuries, and I thought all I lost is one leg. Now let\u2019s get back to living and see what I can still do,\u201d Stockwell said. \u201cI didn\u2019t want to let losing a leg stop me from doing anything that I wanted to do.\u201d</p>\n\n<p>On top of the challenges of training during the pandemic, Stockwell fractured her back in a severe bike crash weeks before the Paralympics. \u201cIt\u2019s amazing that I can be there at the start line,\u201d she said. \u201cIt could have been so much worse.\u201d</p>\n\n<p>For 18-time Paralympic medalist Tatyana McFadden, the arduous journey to Tokyo was a continuation of a lifetime of setbacks. She said if I\u2019d asked her two years ago whether she\u2019d be competing in Tokyo 2020, she would\u2019ve been doubtful. She was diagnosed with a rare blood clotting disorder in 2017. Even after several surgeries, the clots \u201ckept coming back and they kept traveling.\u201d She outlined a 20-month journey to rid her body of the problem, including the lymphedema that happened as a result.</p>\n\n<p>McFadden attributes her harsh childhood as part of the reason why she has become so strong mentally and physically. Born in Russia with spina bifida, she spent the first six years of her life in a St. Petersburg orphanage. With no medical assistance or wheelchair, she taught herself how to walk on her hands.</p>\n\n<p>\u201cI think it came from learning how to survive in the conditions that I was in and having that will to live to the next day, to the next day, to the next day,\u201d said McFadden, who was later adopted by her American mother.</p>\n\n<p>It\u2019s not just these Paralympian\u2019s mental fortitude and determination that strikes me, but also the contagious positivity that they exude. Paralympic swimmer Haven Shepherd tells me the trauma of her past is a source of gratitude, rather than sorrow.</p>\n\n<p>Born in Vietnam, Shepherd said she\u2019s the child of parents who had an affair and were unable to be together. \u201cFor their circumstance they thought the best thing was to commit a family suicide,\u201d she said. When Shepherd was 14 months old, her parents held her between them and detonated a suicide bomb.</p>\n\n<p>\u201cI was blown 40 feet away from the accident, and all the damage was done to my legs,\u201d Shepherd said. \u201cI just think it\u2019s such a miracle that, you know, I survived\u2026and then I was adopted later when I was 20 months old.\u201d</p>\n\n<p>18-year-old Shepherd said she thinks of her biological mom\u2019s act as a sacrifice that led her to have \u201can amazing childhood\u201d. Shepherd smiles broadly as she describes her big family in the Midwest: loving parents, four sisters and two brothers. Shepherd, who mentors other amputees, said she\u2019s confident in showing her prosthetic legs and telling others \u201chow fulfilled my life is by not having legs.\u201d</p>\n\n<p>Many Paralympians also have underlying health conditions, putting them at greater risk if they were to be infected with Covid-19. U.S. wheelchair rugby star and team captain Chuck Aoki tells me he was in complete lockdown during the pandemic before he was vaccinated.</p>\n\n<p>\u201cIt wasn\u2019t something I would want to take any risks with,\u201d Aoki said. \u201cI\u2019ve dealt with so many health issues in my life, it was like the last thing you want to do is deal with getting Covid.\u201d</p>\n\n<p>He was born with a rare genetic disorder, inhibiting feeling in his hands and feet.

CNN hears how these two chess players from different parts of the continent learnt to love the game and how they are hoping to harness their passion to inspire new generations of African chess champions.\n\nAt 26 years old, James Kang\u2019aru Mwangi is Kenya\u2019s national chess champion and coach focused on nurturing young talent. After starting to play chess in 2013-2014, when he joined university, CNN heard he became interested in providing other juniors and youths in Kenya with the same opportunity.\n\nJames started his community outreach and chess in school programs in Ruai, on the outskirts of Nairobi, and Mayoko, another outskirt area in Machakos. He tells CNN that: \u201cWhen those two programs started it was all about having a new sport for the kids and actually giving them the purpose that they would actually use sport too, have some fun activities in the rural areas and especially such outskirt areas. You might not have the best of the football fields or the best of the swimming pools.\u201d\n\nFollowing this initiative, James became the national coach for Kenya\u2019s junior chess team and was recognised as one of the best chess coaches in the game in 2018. As Africa\u2019s youngest international arbiter in coaching, he was awarded the top 35 under 35 years Youth of the Year in sports by the Youth Agenda and Kenya Government. CNN learns he was also listed as Forbes Africa 30 under 30 achievers in 2021.\n\nDespite his achievements, James credits the success of his students as his greatest reward, \u201cThe juniors are a testimony that you can achieve whatever success at whatever age and you can be multi-talented because I have most of them who are now becoming multi-talented.\u201d\n\nOne of James\u2019 students, Joy Nieri Maina, says: \u201dCoach James used to make you understand if you had a problem, he would help you every single time. He really taught you how to relax while you\u2019re playing tactics. So it teaches you how to be comfortable and relax while you\u2019re playing against an opponent.\u201d\n\nCNN discovers that James\u2019s passion for nurturing young talent has had a real impact on the lives of less advantaged children. \u201cHaving some of my students get academic scholarships or having them get benefits as they progress with life and being recognised and getting a number of opportunities and they\u2019re just because they are good in chess is a benefit that I believe as much as it does not come directly to me, you can say that it benefits them, but to me it\u2019s a joy and I believe it\u2019s those little successes and those little milestones start to actually accumulate into big ones,\u201d he says.\n\nThis passion for making chess accessible to children is shared by Tunde Onakoya, a 26 year old Nigeran professional chess player who founded Chess in Slums Africa in 2018. \u201cLearning chess at a really young age literally saved my life. It gave me a lot of opportunities that I probably would never have gotten because of where I grew up,\u201d he says.\n\nHe founded Chess in Slums Africa to help children from impoverished communities reach their full potential through chess and has already taught more than two hundred children the basics of the sport. Tunde explains, \u201cWe have a team of volunteers that dedicate their weekends to come into these slum communities to teach the kids. We don\u2019t just teach them chess; we teach them other things too. We try to infuse, even teaching them tech skills.\u201d\n\nFor Tunde, Chess in Slums Africa goes beyond the sport, as it pushes the children to see beyond their current environment. Through partnerships with organisations such as Vibranium Valley and individual donations, Chess in Slums Africa raised thousands of dollars to send 20 children to school all the way through university. \u201cI mean, that is a dream come true for me, not just for them, but for me too. To see that these children could get opportunities like this, never before thought possible. To see them, now seeing that it is possible to become more than what they can see every day in their community,\u201d says Tunde.\n\nIn the next few years, Tunde hopes to expand Chess in Slums Africa to more communities in Nigeria. He tells CNN: \u201cMy greatest desire for the Chess in Slums project, is to create a future where children from impoverished communities aren\u2019t just defined by their community, they aren\u2019t defined by the poverty of their parents, they aren\u2019t defined by what they look like, they aren\u2019t defined by where they come from or who they are. But instead, to help them discover their truest potential. To help them become the best they can be. I believe every child deserve this opportunity to know the best they can be.\u201d", "articleBodyHtml": "<article>\n\n<figure><img src=\"https://thedailymail.co.ke/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/CNN-meets-Kenyas-chess-champion-CNN-meets-head-of-Nigerias-first-chess-school.-696x391.jpeg\" srcset=\"https://thedailymail.co.ke/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/CNN-meets-Kenyas-chess-champion-CNN-meets-head-of-Nigerias-first-chess-school.-696x391.jpeg 696w, https://thedailymail.co.ke/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/CNN-meets-Kenyas-chess-champion-CNN-meets-head-of-Nigerias-first-chess-school..jpeg 1392w\" sizes=\"(-webkit-min-device-pixel-ratio: 2) 1392px, (min-resolution: 192dpi) 1392px, 696px\" alt=\"\" title=\"CNN meets Kenya's chess champion : CNN meets head of Nigeria's first chess school.\"></figure>\n\n<p>On this week\u2019s <em>African Voices Changemakers</em>, CNN International\u2019s <strong>Arit Okpo</strong> meets <strong>James Kang\u2019aru Mwangi </strong>and <strong>Tunde Onakoya. </strong>CNN hears how these two chess players from different parts of the continent learnt to love the game and how they are hoping to harness their passion to inspire new generations of African chess champions.</p>\n\n<p>At 26 years old, James Kang\u2019aru Mwangi is Kenya\u2019s national chess champion and coach focused on nurturing young talent.

This time, however, the mission was to report on how people from all over the globe would converge for the Olympic games in a city under a state of emergency due to the pandemic.\n\nEven under the best of circumstances, planning to host the Olympic games is one of the most challenging logistical events on the planet. In the middle of an unfolding pandemic, it seemed nearly impossible.\n\nBut after postponing the games for a year, the Japanese government and the International Olympics Committee decided the show \u2014 the games \u2014 must go on.\n\nAnd so they are \u2014 but they\u2019re very different: strange and eerily quiet.\n\nWhen I attended one of the first competitions, the women\u2019s soccer match between the United States and Sweden, only about 50 spectators were allowed in the stadium built for 48,000. There was no traffic on the streets, no vendors, and no lines. There were handwashing stations, temperature checks, and plexiglass partitions \u2014 all of which probably make only a small difference controlling this particular virus. There was no proof of vaccination required either. The most effective measure was the absolute requirement for masks, which security diligently checked to properly fit around our mouth and nose.\n\nThere was distant fan noise piped in and a smattering of applause after remarkable plays. The only time there was any significant noise was when a team scored. That is when the music blared \u2014 so loudly it was as if they forgot to turn down the volume, given it no longer had to compete with the tens of thousands of cheering fans. During this match, that thunderous music was played three times, every time for Sweden.\n\nOn the night of the opening ceremonies, it was a flurry to get into the stadium. Protests echoed from around the outside, but once I got in, the full beauty of architect Kengo Kuma\u2019s creation sunk in.\n\nMajestic and perfectly placed under a delightful night sky, it was filled with years of past planning and future potential.\n\nIt was a caged animal raring to run. On its biggest night, the night of the Opening Ceremony, however, it is tame, quiet, and slumbering. You could almost imagine all the amazing events it will contain, full of cheering voices and smiling faces. Just not tonight.\n\nStill, that didn\u2019t take away from watching the athletes parade out country by country, waving to a nonexistent crowd, but still with smiles emitting from underneath their masks. Fireworks illuminated rows and rows of empty seats. It was a study in contrast. A public health emergency that was at the same time a mental health balm.\n\nI think it\u2019s fair to say the pandemic has been giving the Japanese government and the International Olympic Committee a fair amount of heartburn since it first reared its head.\n\nSo Olympic and government officials devised a pandemic playbook to make the games as safe as possible \u2014 even if they were always under threat of being canceled outright.\n\nAll of these measures have not cleared the metaphorical cloud that continues to hang over the city as the world waits to see how this global event will fare in the face of a pandemic. The major question looming is: Will these now-small number of positive cases show that the protocols outlined in the playbook are working, or will the numbers spike up, underscoring the feeling that holding the Olympics was ill-advised in the first place?

It was really difficult what happened with Barcelona, saying farewell after being there my whole life in one place. And after three days without forgetting what happened, everything changed. I was living with a lot of doubt, a lot of nerves, a lot of anticipation that this would happen and well, a lot of excitement and desire to get started. It was a really special arrival.

The PPEs are valued at Ksh 33 million and include 750 protective goggles, 25,000 disposable gowns, 500,000 nitrile gloves, 500,000 surgical masks, 750 face shields, 12,500 disposable scrubs, 25,000 head covers, 5,000 coveralls and 50,000 KN95 respirator masks.\n\nDuring this COVID-19 period, Faith Based hospitals have proven to be an integral part of the National and County COVID-19 pandemic emergency infrastructure, as they have set aside isolation wards, ICU beds, oxygen treatment support facilities, trained staff and have established protocols for COVID-19 screening, treatment, infection prevention and control. The Faith Based hospitals continue to complement government response to COVID-19 and have been receiving and managing COVID-19 patients with moderate to severe illness. This has resulted in the dire need of PPEs for the protection of frontline staff.\n\nSpeaking at the PPE handover ceremonies, Equity Group Managing Director and CEO, Dr. James Mwangi said, \u201cThrough KCCB and CHAK, we received a request to support 60 mission hospitals across Kenya. As EGF and the COVID-19 Fund Board, we have saw it prudent to make an initial donation to those mission facilities with active COVID-19 isolation units that are currently managing the care of admitted patients. We recognize the role played by mission hospitals in the fight against COVID-19 and in contributing to the access of affordable healthcare services in the country and are glad to offer a second layer of protection for our frontline healthcare workers.\u201d\n\nThe second phase distribution will focus on the remaining 35 mission health facilities, which will benefit from an additional consignment of PPEs when their COVID-19 inpatient isolation and management units are actively in us. Dr. Mwangi further noted that there have been reports of various COVID-19 virus mutations resulting in several variants. He urged Kenyans to stay vigilant and to adhere to the set Ministry of Health guidelines & protocols. \u201cIt is clear that COVID-19 is mutating and now has multiple variants with severe effects. As a country, we are still recording very high COVID-19 numbers, an indication that our battle with the virus is still on. Today\u2019s donation will help a large population of Kenyans who rely on mission hospitals for healthcare services as well as protect our frontline heroes who continue to serve Kenyans selflessly. We make a public call to all Kenyans and ask them to support our local medics by doing their best to reduce exposure to COVID-19 by avoiding crowded places, keeping a safe social distance of at least 1.5 metres and wearing a mask properly when interacting with others.\u201d said Dr. Mwangi.\n\nKCCB oversees within their jurisdiction Catholic Mission hospitals from Level 6 to community level facilities while CHAK is a National Faith Based Organization of the Protestant Churches and their health facilities in Kenya committed to promoting universal access to quality health care.\n\nSpeaking during the event, Chairman of KCCB \u2013 Catholic Health Commission of Kenya, Rt. Rev. Joseph Mbatia said \u201cOne key mandate of the Catholic Health Commission of Kenya is to facilitate the national coordination and management of Catholic health facilities across Kenya. We are humbled that Equity Group Foundation and Kenya COVID-19 Fund Board have put consideration into supporting our health facilities with PPEs. The Catholic Church runs close to 30% of all healthcare facilities in Kenya and this boost will go a long way in protecting our frontline healthcare workers which will trickle down to benefit communities at the grassroot level.\u201d\n\nAlso commenting on the same, Rev Dr. Robert Langat, Chairman CHAK said, \u201cAs CHAK, we are privileged to have a presence through our member mission hospitals in 45 out of the 47 counties. The provision of PPEs by Equity Group Foundation and the Kenya COVID-19 Fund Board will play a huge role in safeguarding the lives of our frontline healthcare workers. Faith based mission hospitals have proven to be critical in the country\u2019s COVID-19 response and the PPEs issued today will help us leverage on the unique strengths of the faith community to mitigate the effects of the pandemic.\u201d\n\nThe health facilities have established Hospital Liaison Committees to support with the management of PPEs in each participating hospital. They are mandated to receive, distribute, oversee proper usage, and re-order to ensure consistent supply of the PPEs to the health care workers. The Liaison committees for each hospital comprises of nominated representatives from Equity; and Healthcare worker representatives, a medical doctor, a clinical officer and a nurse who are members of their professional associations, together with the hospital\u2019s stores in-charge.\n\nThe distribution of locally manufactured PPEs is an initiative of Equity Group Foundation and the Kenya COVID-19 Fund Board as part of a coordinated effort to support frontline healthcare workers through the provision of PPEs.\n\nBeneficiary Mission Hospitals\n\nCounty Name Facility Name Affiliation\nBomet St Clare Kaplong Mission Hospital KCCB\nEmbu Consolata Mission Hospital Kyeni KCCB\nHoma Bay Asumbi Mission Hospital KCCB\nKiambu St. Matia Mulumba Mission Hospital KCCB\nKirinyaga Our Lady of Lourdes Hospital Mwea KCCB\nKisumu St Elizabeth Hospital Chiga KCCB\nKitui Muthale Mission Hospital KCCB\nMeru Consolata Hospital Nkubu KCCB\nMigori St. Joseph\u2019s Mission Hospital Migori KCCB\nMurang\u2019a Kiriaini Mission Hospital KCCB\nMurang\u2019a St. Raphael Gaichanjiru Mission Hospital KCCB\nNairobi St Mary\u2019s Mission Hospital KCCB\nNairobi St. Francis Community Hospital, Kasarani KCCB\nTaita Taveta St. Joseph Shelter of Hope Mission Hospital, Voi KCCB\nBomet Tenwek Hospital \u2013 Main Hospital CHAK\nBungoma Friends Lugulu Mission Hospital CHAK\nElgeyo Marakwet AIC Kapsowar Hospital CHAK\nKericho AIC Litein Hospital CHAK\nKiambu Kikuyu (PCEA) Hospital CHAK\nKiambu AIC Kijabe Hospital CHAK\nKilifi St Luke\u2019s (ACK) Hospital Kaloleni CHAK\nKirinyaga Mt Kenya (ACK) Hospital CHAK\nMeru Maua Methodist Hospital CHAK\nTharaka Nithi PCEA Chogoria Hospital CHAK\nMombasa Sayyida Fatimah Hospital NGO/ MISSION\n\nPPE Distribution Per Mission Hospital\n\nItem No. per Mission Facility Total donated PPEs\nProtective Goggles 300 750\nDisposable Gowns \u2013 Mixed Sizes 1,000 25,000\nNitrile gloves \u2013 Mixed Sizes 20,000 500,000\nSurgical Masks 20,000 500,000\nFace Shields 300 750\nDisposable Scrubs -Mixed Sizes 500 12,500\nHead/ Hair Covers 1,000 25,000\nCoveralls \u2013 Mixed Sizes 200 5,000\nKN95 Respirator Masks 2,000.0 50,000", "articleBodyHtml": "<article>\n\n<figure><img src=\"https://thedailymail.co.ke/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/Equity-Group-Foundation-and-the-Kenya-COVID-19-Fund-Board-donate-PPEs-valued-at-Ksh-33-Million-to-Mission-Hospitals-696x356.jpeg\" srcset=\"https://thedailymail.co.ke/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/Equity-Group-Foundation-and-the-Kenya-COVID-19-Fund-Board-donate-PPEs-valued-at-Ksh-33-Million-to-Mission-Hospitals-696x356.jpeg 696w, https://thedailymail.co.ke/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/Equity-Group-Foundation-and-the-Kenya-COVID-19-Fund-Board-donate-PPEs-valued-at-Ksh-33-Million-to-Mission-Hospitals-1392x712.jpeg 1392w\" sizes=\"(-webkit-min-device-pixel-ratio: 2) 1392px, (min-resolution: 192dpi) 1392px, 696px\" alt=\"\" title=\"Equity Group Foundation and the Kenya COVID-19 Fund Board donate PPE's valued at Ksh 33 Million to Mission Hospitals\"></figure>\n\n<p>Equity Group Foundation and the Kenya COVID-19 Fund Board have today donated medical grade PPEs to 25 mission hospitals affiliated to the Kenya Conference of Catholic Bishops (KCCB) and Christian Health Association of Kenya (CHAK), as part of its phase one distribution to mission hospitals across Kenya.

This has resulted in the dire need of PPEs for the protection of frontline staff.</p>\n\n<p>Speaking at the PPE handover ceremonies, Equity Group Managing Director and CEO, Dr. James Mwangi said, \u201cThrough KCCB and CHAK, we received a request to support 60 mission hospitals across Kenya. As EGF and the COVID-19 Fund Board, we have saw it prudent to make an initial donation to those mission facilities with active COVID-19 isolation units that are currently managing the care of admitted patients. We recognize the role played by mission hospitals in the fight against COVID-19 and in contributing to the access of affordable healthcare services in the country and are glad to offer a second layer of protection for our frontline healthcare workers.\u201d</p>\n\n<p>The second phase distribution will focus on the remaining 35 mission health facilities, which will benefit from an additional consignment of PPEs when their COVID-19 inpatient isolation and management units are actively in us. Dr. Mwangi further noted that there have been reports of various COVID-19 virus mutations resulting in several variants. He urged Kenyans to stay vigilant and to adhere to the set Ministry of Health guidelines &amp; protocols. \u201cIt is clear that COVID-19 is mutating and now has multiple variants with severe effects. As a country, we are still recording very high COVID-19 numbers, an indication that our battle with the virus is still on. Today\u2019s donation will help a large population of Kenyans who rely on mission hospitals for healthcare services as well as protect our frontline heroes who continue to serve Kenyans selflessly. We make a public call to all Kenyans and ask them to support our local medics by doing their best to reduce exposure to COVID-19 by avoiding crowded places, keeping a safe social distance of at least 1.5 metres and wearing a mask properly when interacting with others.\u201d said Dr. Mwangi.</p>\n\n<p>KCCB oversees within their jurisdiction Catholic Mission hospitals from Level 6 to community level facilities while CHAK is a National Faith Based Organization of the Protestant Churches and their health facilities in Kenya committed to promoting universal access to quality health care.</p>\n\n<p>Speaking during the event, Chairman of KCCB \u2013 Catholic Health Commission of Kenya, Rt. Rev. Joseph Mbatia said \u201cOne key mandate of the Catholic Health Commission of Kenya is to facilitate the national coordination and management of Catholic health facilities across Kenya. We are humbled that Equity Group Foundation and Kenya COVID-19 Fund Board have put consideration into supporting our health facilities with PPEs.\u00a0\u00a0The Catholic Church runs close to 30% of all healthcare facilities in Kenya and this boost will go a long way in protecting our frontline healthcare workers which will trickle down to benefit communities at the grassroot level.\u201d</p>\n\n<p>Also commenting on the same, Rev Dr. Robert Langat, Chairman CHAK said, \u201cAs CHAK, we are privileged to have a presence through our member mission hospitals in 45 out of the 47 counties. The provision of PPEs by Equity Group Foundation and the Kenya COVID-19 Fund Board will play a huge role in safeguarding the lives of our frontline healthcare workers. Faith based mission hospitals have proven to be critical in the country\u2019s COVID-19 response and the PPEs issued today will help us leverage on the unique strengths of the faith community to mitigate the effects of the pandemic.\u201d</p>\n\n<p>The health facilities have established Hospital Liaison Committees to support with the management of PPEs in each participating hospital. They are mandated to receive, distribute, oversee proper usage, and re-order to ensure consistent supply of the PPEs to the health care workers. The Liaison committees for each hospital comprises of nominated representatives from Equity; and Healthcare worker representatives, a medical doctor, a clinical officer and a nurse who are members of their professional associations, together with the hospital\u2019s stores in-charge.</p>\n\n<p>The distribution of locally manufactured PPEs is an initiative of Equity Group Foundation and the Kenya COVID-19 Fund Board as part of a coordinated effort to support frontline healthcare workers through the provision of PPEs.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Beneficiary Mission
