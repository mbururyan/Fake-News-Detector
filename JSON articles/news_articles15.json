Student visa denials!\n\nWell, I was denied visa 4 times before I finally managed to get one to study in USA.\n\nStatistics show that ONLY 30% of Africans get visa approvals to study in North America i.e. US & Canada. Yes, only 30%.\n\nThat paints a very gloomy picture for any aspiring international student.\n\nSo, what does that statistic really tell you? It means that when you get into that embassy door for the visa interview, majority of the people you will find are those with teary eyes holding the dreaded pink slips. It\u2019s the reality! But you don\u2019t have to be part of that statistic though if you play your cards well!\n\nHaving been engaged as a consultant for those interested in studying in USA, I have a solid experience on student visa matters, and I am here to share information that hopefully will give you an edge when it comes to getting US student visas.\n\nFirst, please know that the US loves and appreciates international students.\n\nYearly, about 1 million international students join various universities in America\u2026That says it all!\n\nEducation in the US is world class, and the country sells itself to the rest of the world as the destination for higher education because they want to attract the best talent out there.\n\nSchools here can\u2019t survive without international students. In fact, they charge double tuition fees to international students, so they really need them.\n\nSo, what this means is that, if you can show that you are a REAL brilliant student, then you should not have a problem getting a student visa.\n\nNow, the questions then are how do you show that visa officer that you are REAL brilliant student? And what does it even mean by REAL?\n\nBy law, visa officers are mandated to assume that anyone seeking a non-immigrant visa such as a student visa has an intention of migrating to USA and not returning.\n\nSo, it\u2019s up to you to prove to the visa officer that you are a student who will be going to school and is not just seeking a student visa as a means of landing in America.\n\nUnfortunately, many Africans intention of seeking a student visa is not to go to school but to just land in the US and look for work.\n\nWe\u2019ll, guess what? The embassy knows this. They have all the data that shows most of us Africans rarely go back.\n\nHowever, having said that, always remember that, In fact the student visa has a clear path to citizenship because the US government love the best brains to remain in the country after studies!\n\nIn fact, many innovations have been accomplished by ex-international students. See the likes of Elon Musk, google CEO and many more.\n\nThe US government offers work visas and employment-based green cards to those who graduate in the US and have skills to solve complex problems for America that most Americans don\u2019t have.\n\nSo now, how can you increase your visa approval odds?\n\nYou MUST show you have a good knowledge of what you are coming to study\u2026i.e., you must be able to articulate very well the finer details of why you are coming to study a certain program and why specifically that school.\n\nRegarding this, they will ask you whether you also applied to any other school, and your answer should always be YES. And of course, have maybe 2 names of other schools with you.\n\nAlso, you should be ready to explain why you chose that specific school and not the others.\n\nThis is because a REAL student will take time to do research about a school and the program of study.\n\nAlso know the units you will study especially in your first semesters. You can\u2019t claim you are coming to study something and yet you have no idea of some of the units you will do. Do your homework!\n\nStill on this, if you have already done your undergraduate, you should NEVER try come to a community college or another undergraduate.\n\nMany Africans out there are misadvised to come to community colleges just because they are cheap.\n\nA REAL student who has an undergraduate degree already would come for a master\u2019s and not to a community college.\n\nAlso, another mistake many do is that they try to come to study for something unrelated to what they did previously. This is also a recipe for denial.\n\nFor example, don\u2019t come to a community college to do nursing and yet you already did a BCom for your undergraduate.\n\nThis community college-nursing story is very common within our community and almost always ends up in tears to the visa applicant.\n\nIf you are so desperate to do that nursing undergraduate degree, get accepted to 2 programs from the same school i.e., a nursing undergraduate plus a masters tied to your previous bachelor s degree, then use the master\u2019s to seek the visa and then once you land in the US, transfer to that nursing programs.\n\nHowever, If you have done an undergrad, you should always come for a masters. Anything to the contrary will get you a pink slip.\n\nStill on this, please note the US government values graduate students more, so try to come here for either master\u2019s or PHD.\n\nIf anything, it\u2019s better to come here when you are more matured. Also, undergraduate studies can be very expensive, so finish undergraduate in your country then move here for your master\u2019s.\n\nIt\u2019s also easy to be funded for graduate studied. You can get a student loan for masters and most PHDs are actually fully funded via graduate/research assistantship scholarships, especially STEM programs.\n\nSTEM is acronym for Science, Technology, Engineering, Mathematics!\n\nSo, avoid coming to those community colleges and undergraduate level studies.\n\nThis now takes me to the next point!\n\nYou MUST have your finances. This is arguably one of the other main reasons why Africans get denied student visas.\n\nYou will find that majority of the people will look for a bank statement from anywhere and then present to the embassy claiming their Uncle, Aunty, or Cousin is supporting them!\n\nThis is the stupidest thing we keep repeating all the time.\n\nThe first thing the visa officer will ask you is \u201cWhy would your uncle pay for example 5 Million KES for your education?\u201d\n\nIn reality, there is no Uncle/Auntie/Cousin who will pay for you that large amount of money for your studies even if they were loaded\u2026It\u2019s just so obvious! Please use your common sense!\n\nThe only person who can pay that kind of money for your education is only your parents! Unless you are sponsored by an institution. .and not an individual!\n\nSo, this craziness of getting bank statements from all kinds of sources should STOP!\n\nIf you are a REAL student, you should have REAL funding for your studies.\n\nNever try to come here thinking you will work and pay for your school fees. It\u2019s almost impossible. The moment you show real funding then you won\u2019t have a problem getting the visa.\n\nSo, then the next question is how do you get to show real funding? The easiest way is to get an unsecured international student loan.\n\nThere are lenders out there who offer these loans and you will get an approval letter that you will take to the embassy and believe you me that is what the visa officer wants to see. These lenders usually support master\u2019s students. You can find some of them at www.appstecamerica.com\n\nWith that letter, you will get the visa. You only take the letter to the embassy, not bank statements.\n\nI have handled so many cases of student visas and those with student loans are almost always guaranteed student visas.\n\nA student loan just shows you are a serious student who is ready to do anything to pay for education the US.\n\nSo please stop this madness of getting bank statements and claiming it\u2019s from your Uncles, Aunties and Cousins!\n\nEven if your Uncle was to pay for your education, DO NOT bring that story to the embassy. You will be disappointed.\n\nFinally, confidence is KEY. Americans are mostly very confident people, and to some extent they expect the same from anybody who is seeking a student visa.\n\nConfidence comes with hours of preparation and of course having the right supporting documents for your case!\n\nSo don\u2019t go there and start talking in a submissive way to the visa officer. Have the energy and talk in a very convincing way about your program of study and you will come out victorious.\n\nIf you read this all the way here, I wish you good luck in your journey. I was in your shoes at one point in time, but I never gave up. But be smart about these things. There is no other magic about getting a student visa, you just must put in the effort needed.\n\nSee you soon on this side!\n\nA little bit about me,\n\nI am the co-founder of The KENYA Airlift Program.

Delk said the traffic back up past the I-575 split. He said officers were quickly able to divert most of the traffic off the interstate and then worked to clear the traffic jam.\n\n\u201cSlow down, put your phone down, pay attention to the other traffic on the roadway,\u201d Delk said. \u201cYou could be doing everything correctly and still be involved in a horrific accident.

She has been described as being soft spoken, avid church member, very organized and a businesswoman. She was a mother to six wonderful children.\n\nDorothy passed away December 17th 2020 under strange circumstances.

It has been mentioned by her partner that she \u201caccidentally\u201d drowned in the bathtub. Unfortunately, after her death, Dorothy\u2019s children, parents, siblings and friends were not allowed to see her and were completely denied access to her remains by her partner.\n\nWhile her family went through the legal channels to get access to her body and perform an independent autopsy, her partner hurriedly decided to dispose of her in a corner of a cemetery and denying her proper final rights with her family.\n\nThe family is in distress and would like to have answers to what happened in that house They would like to have closure to and give a befitting send off for their loved one. We are appealing to you to support this cause, whatever little you can give will go a long way to help this family.\n\nThe budget has been set at $100, 000 to be able to support the following efforts.\n\nLegal \u2013 There are 2 on going cases (temporary custody of Dorothy\u2019s remains and custody of the 6 children).

We hope this message finds you well.</p>\n\n<p>Who was Dorothy Ongera? Dorothy was a mother, daughter, sister, friend and a decent HUMAN being. She has been described as being soft spoken, avid church member, very organized and a businesswoman. She was a mother to six wonderful children.</p>\n\n<p>Dorothy passed away December 17th 2020 under strange circumstances. Her cause of death was ruled as \u201caccidental drowning\u201d by the preliminary Medical Examiner\u2019s report. It has been mentioned by her partner that she \u201caccidentally\u201d drowned in the bathtub. Unfortunately, after her death, Dorothy\u2019s children, parents, siblings and friends were not allowed to see her and were completely denied access to her remains by her partner.</p>\n\n<p>While her family went through the legal channels to get access to her body and perform an independent autopsy, her partner hurriedly decided to dispose of her in a corner of a cemetery and denying her proper final rights with her family.</p>\n\n<p>The family is in distress and would like to have answers to what happened in that house They would like to have closure to and give a befitting send off for their loved one. We are appealing to you to support this cause, whatever little you can give will go a long way to help this family.</p>\n\n<p>The budget has been set at $100, 000 to be able to support the following efforts.</p>\n\n<p>Legal \u2013 There are 2 on going cases (temporary custody of Dorothy\u2019s remains and custody of the 6 children). There will be a potential criminal case if the independent autopsy reveals a crime was done.</p>\n\n<p>Ex Parte Motion \u2013 To give Dorothy\u2019s parents access to her remains urgently to allow them to exhume her body</p>\n\n<p>Exhuming the body</p>\n\n<p>Independent Forensics \u2013 There needs to be an independent autopsy to determine is there was any foul play.</p>\n\n</article>", "videoUrls": ["https://www.youtube.com/embed/KH3uUhKh6Ms?feature=oembed"]},{"url": "https://ksnmedia.com/mombasa-police-officer-dies-by-suicide-asks-ocs-to-use-funeral-contributions-in-settling-debts/", "probability": 0.98944294, "headline": "Mombasa police officer dies by suicide, asks OCS to use funeral contributions in settling debts", "datePublished": "2021-12-10T00:00:00", "datePublishedRaw": "2021-12-10", "dateModified": "2021-12-09T22:43:00", "dateModifiedRaw": "2021-12-09 10:43 pm", "author": "KSN Reporter", "authorsList": ["KSN Reporter"], "inLanguage": "en", "mainImage": "https://ksnmedia.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/police-line.jpg", "description": "BY OLIVIA MUNGWANA Changamwe Police Station based police officer has taken his own life after penning a letter to the Officer Commanding Station (OCS).

He was also the Changamwe ward chairman of the then-ruling party Kanu.\n\nAdegu had been approached by a friend for a job he had not done before: Kill a man. The client was Mary Njeri, the wife.\n\n\u201cShe had an affair with a local mechanic and wanted her husband dead because he had become too rough on her. She had set aside Sh45,000 for the job,\u201d he recalls.\n\nNjeri\u2019s relationship with her husband had deteriorated when he learnt about her affair with a mechanic. Things got thick when Mwai discovered that she had bought the boyfriend new equipment for his workshop, which was a few kilometers from their residence.\n\nWith a great sense of betrayal, Mwai stormed the workshop and took away the items, a move that irked his wife.\n\n\u201cSince I had no money, I accepted to participate in the murder,\u201d says Adegu, who was then a casual labourer in Bamburi.\n\nOn the night of the mission, he joined two of his friends, Said Kiondo and Fredric Katulo, for the assignment. They were to kill him as he returned home at night.\n\n\u201cShe told us her husband normally returns home at 1am, so we left that night and waited for him in their house from 11pm,\u201d he says.\n\nArmed with a metal bar and a panga, they strategically took positions in the living room.\n\n\u201cShe alerted us as soon as she heard the security bell. We watched as she welcomed him home with a hug, little did he know it was his last day. We quickly swung into action and hit his head from behind thrice; he fell down and began bleeding. We dragged his body and left it at a corner in the living room,\u201d he recalls, regretfully.\n\nAs they attacked him, the wife ran towards the bedroom, which was on the first floor.\n\n\u201cWe then followed her, took our money and left,\u201d he says.\n\nIt was supposed to be a quick, clean job. However, one of them messed up the plan and it did not take long before detectives pounced on them, one after the other.\n\nSentenced to death\n\nAfter only weeks of investigations, they were all charged with murder.\n\n\u201cKiondo was responsible for our arrest because he had been seen with the woman before and after the murder, so he was the first suspect. When they got him, he gave us in. He escorted the police to our homes and that is how we were arrested. We suspected he was tortured,\u201d he says.\n\nNjeri was also arrested and charged.\n\nIn the ruling, the court noted that Njeri hatched a plot with Kiondo, whom she had had an affair with for two-and-a-half years, to recruit other people to kill her husband. The court further noted the deceased died a very painful death from cut wounds he had sustained.\n\nIn the trial, the court heard that a day before the murder, Njeri and Kiondo met with another tall man at Mtopanga Bar in the presence of two other accomplices. The two men later became prosecution witnesses.\n\nAdegu was sentenced to death, which was later reduced to life imprisonment upon appeal. He was sent to Kamiti Maximum Prison, where he spent 20 years before being transferred to Shimo La Tewa, where he served for 13 years.\n\nAdegu regrets taking part in the murder and is yet to recover from the psychological trauma he has undergone over the years.\n\n\u201cThe events of the fateful night are still clear in my mind. I still remember how we attacked him and how he groaned until he died. I have prayed, and I believe God has forgiven me,\u201d he offers.\n\n30 years behind bars\n\n\u201cLike the Biblical Paul and Silas, I prayed day and night. Life in prison is not easy, I have been through challenges that I would have avoided had I concentrated on my work and refused to allow greed to control me,\u201d he says, regretfully.\n\n\u201cI lost my family. My wife left with our two children. I haven\u2019t seen her since my arrest. She did not visit me in jail or at the police station. She just left with the children,\u201d he says in an interview on March 29 in Mombasa.\n\nAfter 30 years behind bars, Adegu filed a petition before the High Court in Mombasa. He did not touch on his innocence but pleaded with the court for mercy, saying he had learnt his lessons, reformed and would wish to be set free.\n\n\u201cI have reformed and transformed through different trainings that have earned me skills, which will assist me earn my daily bread if given a chance to rejoin the society. I am also old and sickly. I am epileptic,\u201d he wrote.\n\nThe state submitted that Adegu committed a grave offence, considering that a life was lost, and prayed for a definite and deterrent sentence of 50 years\u2019 imprisonment.\n\nThe court called for a probation report, which indicated that Adegu\u2019s had good conduct and was disciplined. In terms of training, it indicated that he had done carpentry, upholstery and biblical studies.\n\n\u201cHe has been elevated to special stage in the prison progress stage system due to good character. The prisoner regrets the offence he committed and claim he was a young man, who wanted money. He has embraced Christianity and has prayed for forgiveness,\u201d the probation report by Macharia Annah stated.\n\nRe-unite with family\n\nIt also said his family was ready to forgive him, and that prior to his arrest and jailing, he had not formerly introduced any woman, as his wife, to them. So they were not aware of his marriage or the children.\n\n\u201cThe inmate seems to have learnt his lesson for the time he has been in custody. He has a positive attitude and he may be considered for release. He will be supervised and enrolled in appropriate aftercare programmes,\u201d Ms Annah stated in her report.\n\nMombasa Resident Judge Eric Ogola said in his final decision that the report was positive and the court was satisfied that the petitioner \u2013 being a first offender \u2013 had transformed by taking up courses to better himself.\n\n\u201cHe has been in prison for 31 years; he committed the crime in his youth at 32 years, now he is a remorseful old man of 63 years. I am satisfied he has served sufficient time in prison, and that he is now a changed person, who can go out there and venture into business as he is now empowered through the training he went through in prison. I am inclined to sentence the petitioner to the term already served. The Petitioner is set at liberty unless otherwise lawfully held,\u201d the judge stated.\n\nAdegu left Shimo La Tewa Prisons on March 24 and has promised to use the remaining part of his life to re-unite with his family and live his life according to \u201cGod\u2019s will\u201d.\n\n\u201cI am looking for my children, let them show up wherever they are. I am here for them and ready to start a new life with them. I ask for their forgiveness and allow me spend the remaining part of my life with them. 32 years is a very long time to miss your loved ones,\u201d he offers.\n\nAt the time of his arrest, his first born child was six years old while the second was three.\n\n\u201cThey are now adults. I hope they will forgive, accept and welcome me,\u201d he says.\n\nHe is, however, not interested in a reunion with his ex-wife.\n\n\u201cLet her enjoy her life where she is,\u201d he says. \u201cI regret what I did. I truly do,\u201d he says, then saunters off, to a new world, and beginnings.", "articleBodyHtml": "<article>\n\n<p data-reader-unique-id=\"2\">After killing him, we went upstairs, received Sh15,000 each and went home.</p>\n\n<p data-reader-unique-id=\"8\">This is Nahashon Adegu, 63, who spent almost 34 years in prison for the brutal murder of a Mombasa businessman.</p>\n\n<p data-reader-unique-id=\"10\">Adegu was sentenced to death in 1989 alongside two other men for the murder of Josphat Karani Mwai at his Changamwe home on December 6, 1987.</p>\n\n<p data-reader-unique-id=\"12\">Mwai was a politician, a Gema big shot and a prominent distributor of beer in Coast.

Life in prison is not easy, I have been through challenges that I would have avoided had I concentrated on my work and refused to allow greed to control me,\u201d he says, regretfully.</p>\n\n<p data-reader-unique-id=\"73\">\u201cI lost my family. My wife left with our two children. I haven\u2019t seen her since my arrest. She did not visit me in jail or at the police station. She just left with the children,\u201d he says in an interview on March 29 in Mombasa.</p>\n\n<p data-reader-unique-id=\"75\">After 30 years behind bars, Adegu filed a petition before the High Court in Mombasa. He did not touch on his innocence but pleaded with the court for mercy, saying he had learnt his lessons, reformed and would wish to be set free.</p>\n\n<p data-reader-unique-id=\"77\">\u201cI have reformed and transformed through different trainings that have earned me skills, which will assist me earn my daily bread if given a chance to rejoin the society. I am also old and sickly. I am epileptic,\u201d he wrote.</p>\n\n<p data-reader-unique-id=\"83\">The state submitted that Adegu committed a grave offence, considering that a life was lost, and prayed for a definite and deterrent sentence of 50 years\u2019 imprisonment.</p>\n\n<p data-reader-unique-id=\"85\">The court called for a probation report, which indicated that Adegu\u2019s had good conduct and was disciplined. In terms of training, it indicated that he had done carpentry, upholstery and biblical studies.</p>\n\n<p data-reader-unique-id=\"87\">\u201cHe has been elevated to special stage in the prison progress stage system due to good character. The prisoner regrets the offence he committed and claim he was a young man, who wanted money. He has embraced Christianity and has prayed for forgiveness,\u201d the probation report by Macharia Annah stated.</p>\n\n<h2 data-reader-unique-id=\"89\">Re-unite with family</h2>\n\n<p data-reader-unique-id=\"91\">It also said his family was ready to forgive him, and that prior to his arrest and jailing, he had not formerly introduced any woman, as his wife, to them. So they were not aware of his marriage or the children.</p>\n\n<p data-reader-unique-id=\"95\">\u201cThe inmate seems to have learnt his lesson for the time he has been in custody. He has a positive attitude and he may be considered for release. He will be supervised and enrolled in appropriate aftercare programmes,\u201d Ms Annah stated in her report.</p>\n\n<p data-reader-unique-id=\"97\">Mombasa Resident Judge Eric Ogola said in his final decision that the report was positive and the court was satisfied that the petitioner \u2013 being a first offender \u2013 had transformed by taking up courses to better himself.</p>\n\n<p data-reader-unique-id=\"99\">\u201cHe has been in prison for 31 years; he committed the crime in his youth at 32 years, now he is a remorseful old man of 63 years. I am satisfied he has served sufficient time in prison, and that he is now a changed person, who can go out there and venture into business as he is now empowered through the training he went through in prison. \u00a0I am inclined to sentence the petitioner to the term already served. The Petitioner is set at liberty unless otherwise lawfully held,\u201d the judge stated.</p>\n\n<p data-reader-unique-id=\"105\">Adegu left Shimo La Tewa Prisons on March 24 and has promised to use the remaining part of his life to re-unite with his family and live his life according to \u201cGod\u2019s will\u201d.</p>\n\n<p data-reader-unique-id=\"107\">\u201cI am looking for my children, let them show up wherever they are. I am here for them and ready to start a new life with them. I ask for their forgiveness and allow me spend the remaining part of my life with them. 32 years is a very long time to miss your loved ones,\u201d he offers.</p>\n\n<p data-reader-unique-id=\"109\">At the time of his arrest, his first born child was six years old while the second was three.</p>\n\n<p data-reader-unique-id=\"111\">\u201cThey are now adults. I hope they will forgive, accept and welcome me,\u201d he says.</p>\n\n<p data-reader-unique-id=\"113\">He is, however, not interested in a reunion with his ex-wife.</p>\n\n<p data-reader-unique-id=\"115\">\u201cLet her enjoy her life where she is,\u201d he says. \u201cI regret what I did. I truly do,\u201d he says, then saunters off, to a new world, and beginnings.</p>\n\n</article>"},{"url": "https://ksnmedia.com/recreating-pangani-estate-with-more-affordable-houses/#comment-184", "probability": 0.99454665, "headline": "Recreating Pangani Estate with more affordable houses", "datePublished": "2021-03-03T00:00:00", "datePublishedRaw": "2021-03-03", "dateModified": "2021-03-04T14:39:00", "dateModifiedRaw": "2021-03-04 2:39 pm", "author": "KSN Reporter", "authorsList": ["KSN Reporter"], "inLanguage": "en", "mainImage": "https://ksnmedia.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/pangani.jpg", "description": "The Pangani Housing Project is an initiative by the Nairobi City County Government in partnership with Tecnofin Kenya Limited to recreate Pangani Estate in Nairobi.
