fateful day, the suspect allegedly senselessly kicked the baby left, right and centre leading to his death, then stuffed the body in a bag that he gave to the wife before sending her away.</p>\n\n<p>Mr. Oreme added that the matter that happened secretly was only discovered by the administrators in Western Kenya when the estranged wife reached her paternal home with the body in a

hope for the resumption of sporting activities in the country even as stakeholders await the joint declaration of the same by the Ministry of health and that of sports.\n\nSporting activities came to a halt following a raft of measures announced to contain the spread of Covid 19 third wave. Apart from the mainstream top and second-tier leagues, community football has equally suffered as the upcoming talent took a break in their efforts to follow set-out guidelines.\n\nJust before the announcement of the new guidelines Bangbet, Kenya had organized the Bangbet Champee wa mtaa tournament the winning team Kipaji FC walking away with the grand price of Ksh.200, 000 as 1 st runners up AV fitness got awarded Ksh.100, 000 and Bundes Fc ranked 3rd position getting Ksh.75, 000.\n\nSuch tournaments held in Kibera and other regions in Nairobi attract great interest from neighboring communities where the participating clubs represent. The Bangbet Champe wa mtaa tournament for example attracted over 3,000 fans who rallied behind their different teams from. Were there emotions? Much of it was evident especially on the final day as Kipaji FC celebrated their resounding victory.\n\nAll participating teams benefitted from jerseys and balls which with the hope of the resumption of sporting activities help them pick up team training and hopefully other corporates will join in to push community football even further through such competitive tournaments.\n\n\u201cTimes have been rough and tough since the pandemic kicked in. A lot of things have changed beginning from how games are played to how games get watched and most importantly the game financing because there has been few organized tournaments.

The mani man Smith Mackenzie aka Jared", "articleBody": "As Jared Otieno\u2019s associate was being jailed in August for 1 year for his involvement in the Sh14 million gold scam. The mani man Smith Mackenzie aka Jared Otieno was hiding in Dubai.\n\nIn the light of Mike Sonko\u2019s leaks about corruption in the Judiciary, it is well to look at the Magistrate\u2019s frustration with the whole Jared Otieno\u2019s saga.\n\nThe Magistrate expressed frustrations that Jared Otieno, one of the main cartels in the fake gold syndicate was still at large.\n\n\u201cJared Otieno is still at large and they have failed to arrest him, \u201d the magistrate said as he issued his ruling also adding that there was a bigger person behind the scam.\n\nAccording to a local gossip blog, Otieno\u2019s wife Kendi Mwiti, was in Dubai celebrating her second pregnancy. Hidden from the prying eyes of the public, while her husband might have just been hiding in plain sight in Kenya; having pocketed all the law enforcement agencies.\n\nKendi\u2019s Instagram is restricted, however, in the photoshoot she captioned one of baby bump photos saying: \u201cI am so grateful girls, best surprise ever.\u201d\n\nKendi was dressed in a turquoise long flowing gown. The only jewelry was her wedding ring, a Sterling Silver Purple Amethyst gemstone ring and well-manicured nails. She also rocked a Kenya flag coloured bracelet.\n\nAs she enjoys, security forces in Kenya also do, from proceeds of Jared\u2019s crime.\n\nIt is quite curious how DCI often arrests gold scammers but never show their faces.\n\nOur sources confirm that Jared Otieno was arrested last Friday, but later released after doing what he normally does best; bribe all the levels of security forces.\n\nIn a high magnitude dossier that has been seen by this blogger, the corruption in the gold scam, collusion with security agencies and the frustration of court cases is laid bare.\n\nWith so much money, Jared Otieno who had in recent times stepped away from the day to day running of the gold scam business, is eyeing the Homabay Governor seat come 2022.\n\nHis gold scam business is currently run by his brother-in-law Bruno Oliende, who is also eyeing the Suna East Seat currently held by a common thief and petty scammer Junet Mohamed.\n\n\u201cHe (Jared Otieno) no longer does the business and he has his boys\u201d, said our source.\n\nGold Scam\u2019s damning report\n\nA report by the Joint Task Force for Anti & Counter Corruption (JTACC), an organization that assists Governments and Private Sector to deal with corruption, fraud and money laundering names Kenya as one of the key conduits of gold scamming business.\n\nUnfortunately, the report also adds that the gold smuggling business also funds the terrorism in the Democratic Republic of Congo (DRC).\n\nFounded in 2015, JTACC had done extensive research on the gold smuggling syndicate.\n\nThe transnational criminal syndicate whose heads in Kenya is well known (Jared Otieno and Tom Ngoe) has roots in Tanzania and Uganda too. According to JTACC, in 2015, they pulled off a sophisticated \u2018scam\u2019 designed to defraud the Mauritius based investment fund, OHR Strategic Investments and OHR Partners resulting in a financial loss to the company to the tune of Sh762 million.\n\nAs seen in the case where a local law firm was used to launder Nigerian Scammer Huspuppis lot.

Mr. Orumoi Jonah, Head of Legal Services. Mr. John Karia and Ms. Nora Ratemo. at Tourism Finance Corporation\n\nA: SUNDOWNER LODGE LIMITED VS KENYA TOURISM DEVELOPMENT CORPORATION (KTDC) \u2014 H. C. C. C NO. 481 of 2003\n\n1. The Corporation was taken to court by Sundowner Lodge Limited in a court case ref: H.C.C.0 No. 381 of 2003 claiming a total compensation of Kshs. 421.760.000 from a claim arising from an offer to issue a financial facility to the plaintiff for the construction of a two-star hotel in Nakuru.\n\n2. The Corporation engaged the services of Muiru, Mungai & Company Africa Advocates (MMC Africa Advocates) to defend the Corporation in the suit.\n\n3. The Court Case was concluded in July 2014 and Sundowner Lodge Limited was awarded a total damage of Kshs. 30 million instead of Kshs. 421.760.000 as claimed.\n\n4. On 4th July 2014. MMC Africa Advocates submitted to the Corporation legal fees of Kshs. 11.507.085 which was based on the claim pleaded in the plaint of Kshs. 421.760.000 (Evidence 1).\n\n5. In a Letter Ref: TDC/KTDC/001/08 dated on 11th August 2014. the then Head of Legal Servicers, Carrey Francis, challenged the legal fees amounts submitted by the MMC Africa Advocates and requested them to revise it based on Advocates Remuneration Order as per the claim of Kshs. 421,760.000 (Evidence 2).\n\nLoading...\n\n6.MMC Africa Advocates resubmitted its legal to Kshs. 10,710,095 through their letter Ref: DC/KTDC/001/08 dated 15th August 2014. This was further challenged as being high and requested to revise downwards again (Evidence 3).\n\nLoading...\n\n7. On the 7th November 2014 through their letter Ref: DC/KTDC/001/08. MMC Africa Advocates resubmitted again legal fees of Kshs. 10.362,095 which the Corporation paid and cleared the MMC Africa Advocates legal fees for defending the Corporation on the claimant amount of Kshs. 421,760.000 (Evidence 4).\n\nLoading...\n\n8. The Corporation decided to appeal against the Kshs. 30 million damage awarded to Sundownder Lodge Limited and engaged the services of MMC Africa Advocates to file the appeal case for the Corporation not to pay Kshs. 30 million.\n\n9. For the appeal to be filed, the Court demanded Kshs. 30.153 million to be deposited in a joint account and to be operated by both lawyers and it should interest-earning account. The funds were deposited in Credit Bank on le January 2015 (Evidence 7(a)).\n\n10. In November 2018. the Corporation won the appeal as the Kshs. 30 million awarded to Sundowner was set aside.\n\n11. On 8\u2019h October 2018, MMC Africa Advocates through their letter Ref: D2/KTDC/001/18-B submitted legal fees of Kshs. 11,142,436 which was based on Kshs. 421,760,000 that had been concluded in 2014 and paid (Evidence 5).\n\nLoading...\n\n12. Sundowner Lodge Limited appealed in Supreme Court against the appeal court decision and the Corporation engaged the services of MMC Africa Advocates to defend the Corporation in the Supreme Court. In this respect. MMC Africa Advocates through their letter Ref: D2/KTDC/001/18-C dated 16\u2019h October 2018 submitted legal fees invoice of Kshs. 1.797.200 (Evidence 6).\n\nLoading...\n\n13. The Credit Bank fixed deposit on 9\u2019h October 2018 had grown to Kshs. 41,095,376.04 having earned interest income of Kshs. 10,942.376.04 (Evidence 7).\n\n{See above}\n\n14. MMC Africa Advocates remitted a total of Kshs. 27.526.020 to the Corporation instead of the Kshs. 41,095,376.04 in the Credit Bank Account having retained Kshs.12,939,636 (11.142.436 + 1,797.200) as MMC Africa Advocates expenses (Evidence 8).\n\nLoading...\n\n15. The following irregularities were committed: (i) The basis for determining the appeal court legal fees of Kshs. 11,142,436 was totally wrong as it amounted to double payment to MMC Africa Advocates as they had been paid Kshs. Kshs. 10.362.095.\n\n(ii) MMC Africa Advocates remitted a total of Kshs. 27,526,020 to the Corporation instead of the Kshs. 41,095.376.04 in the Credit Bank Account having retained Kshs.12,939.636 (11.142.436 + 1.797.200) as MMC Africa Advocates expenses.\n\n(iii) The two legal fees invoices amounting to Kshs.12,939.636 (11,142,436 + 1,797,200) was irregularly retained and withdrawn by MMC Africa Advocates as their expenses.\n\n(iv) The expenses of Kshs. 12.939.636 was not disclosed to the Corporation Finance Department and it is not included in the 2018/19 Financial Statements approved. This understated expenses in the Financial Statements. (v) The interest income earned at the Credit Bank Limited of Kshs. 10.942.376.04 has not been disclosed to Finance Department and was not included in the 2018/19 Financial Statements. hence understating of income declared.\n\n(vi) MMC Africa Advocates invoices did not go through the Corporation\u2019s payment procedures\u2019 in disregard of a well-laid financial policy.\n\n(vii) The money used as fixed deposit was drawn from the loan account and cannot be used to pay operational expenses.\n\n(viii) The payment of Kshs. 1.797,200 for representing the Corporation at the Supreme Court is illegal because the Case is still on-going and advance payment in public sector is illegal. Mr. Karia authorized the MMC to retain as per the correspondences.\n\n(ix) The Corporation therefore cannot account for the Interest Income of Kshs. 10.942.376 earned at the Credit Bank Limited and the legal fees expense of Kshs. 12.939.636 expensed by the MMC Africa Advocates.\n\n16. On 14th January 2015. TFC transferred Kshs. 30.153 million to the joint account of both lawyers at Credit Bank as directed by the Court of Appeal. However, when the Sundowner Lawyers were paid their dues after the Court of Appeal set aside the Kshs. 30 million awarded, the MMC transferred all the remaining money to their accounts. Kshs. 41.095.376.04 on 9th October 2019. This was to facilitate the sharing of the loot.\n\n17. It was illegal for the MMC to transfer TFC money into their private account instead the total money should have been transferred straight to TFC accounts. This was in full knowledge of the Managing Director, Mr. Orumoi.\n\n18. This is purely abuse of public office and misappropriation of public resources by the Managing Director, Mr. Orumoi Jonah and Head of Legal Services, Mr. John Karia who conspired with the MMC Africa Advocates not to remit the entire amounts to the Corporation accounts and failure to adhere to clearly laid down financial procedures on recognizing revenues, interest income and expenses. and legal fees.\n\n19. MMC has been paid double by TFC for this Court case, with the second payments of Kshs. 11,142,436 and Kshs. 1.797.200 being loot shared between TFC officers (Mr. Orumoi and Mr. Karia) and MMC.\n\n20.The Acting Head of Finance (Mr. John Mukuna) can attest to the fact that TFC in May 2015 paid legal fee of Kshs. 10.362.095 to MMC for defending the Corporation in Sundowner court case claim of Kshs. 421 million.\n\nB: ABUSE OF PUBLIC OFFICE BY HEAD OF LEGAL SERVICES. MR. JOHN KARIA\n\n21. Mr. John Karia. the Head of Legal Services & Corporation is also Company Secretary to all the TFC five subsidiaries, Kenya Safari Lodges & Hotels. Golf Hotel, Sunset Hotel, Kabarnet Hotel and Mt. Elgon Lodge. He has been receiving sitting allowance while attending Board meetings for the subsidiaries for the purpose of taking minutes. He is not a director in any of the subsidiary and not entitled to any sitting allowance. He has been assisted to get the sitting allowance from subsidiaries by the Managing Director. Jonan Orumoi because they all come from the same tribe. Maasai.\n\n22.A case in point is that the Kenya National Audit Office has queried Mr. John Karia irregular sitting allowance at Kenya Safari Lodges & Hotels amounting to Kshs. 404,000 (Up to June 2019) not to mention the other four subsidiaries sitting allowance he has been receiving (Evidence 9).\n\nLoading...\n\n23.Apart from getting sitting allowance from Kenya Safari Lodges & Hotels. Mr. John Karia has also been getting sitting allowances and night out allowances in other TFC subsidiaries where he is the Company Secretary. including Sunset Hotel Limited, Golf Hotel Limited Kakamega, Kabarnet Hotel Limited and Mt. Elgon Lodge Limited. These are all illegal payments as he is not a Director of these companies but Company Secretary and on TFC payroll as an employee.\n\n24.0n 26th October 2019. Mr. Karia received Kshs. 14.000 (net tax of Kshs. 6.000) when attended the Board meeting of Sunset Hotel Limited which was an irregular payment as he attend in the capacity of company secretary and not Sunset Hotel Director(Evidence 10).\n\n25.0n 17th January 2020, Mr. Karia received a total of Kshs. 38.200 received (Kshs. 20,000 as sitting allowance and Kshs. 18,200 as night out allowance) when he attended Mt. Elgon Lodge Limited. This is an irregular payment of Kshs. 38.200 as Mr. Karia attended the Board meeting in the capacity of Company Secretary and not a Director of Mt. Elgon Lodge Limited. Even to make matters worse, the amount received by Mr. Karia was inclusive of KRA taxes of Kshs. 6,000. This was contained in a Memo Ref: TFC/INV/12 dated 13th January 2020 that was approved by the Managing Director. Mr. Orumoi knowingly that Mr. Karia in only entitled to a per diem allowance of Kshs. 10.600 per day and not Kshs. 38.200. This was paid from TFC accounts. This is the collusion that is going on at TFC between Mr. Karia and Mr. Orumoi to siphon TFC resources (Evidence 11).\n\nLoading...\n\n26. In respect to the Golf Hotel, Mr. Karia is paid both the sitting allowance of Kshs. 20,000 and night out allowance of Kshs. 18,200 for attending Golf Hotel Board meetings as Company Secretary for the last 2 years. He should only be paid per diem of Kshs. 10,600 per day.\n\n27.In respect to the Kabarnet Hotel. Mr. Karia is paid both the sitting allowance of Kshs. 20,000 and night out allowance of Kshs. 18.200 from TFC accounts for attending Kabarnet Hotel Board meetings as Company Secretary for the last 2 years. He should only be paid per diem of Kshs. 10,600 per day.\n\n28.Mr. Karia for the last two years has received over Kshs. 1.5 million both as sitting allowance and night out allowance for attending board meetings of subsidiaries as Company Secretary which is highly irregular payments and abuse of public office. Instead he should be paid per diem as it has been the case when he has been taking the TFC Board for project visits or retreats.\n\n29. Evidences 9, 10 and 11 are only samples of the graft going on at TFC with Mr. Orumoi and his fellow maasai Mr. Karia.\n\nC: KENYA NATIONAL AUDIT OFFICE BRIBES BY HEAD CREDIT. MS. NORAH RATEMO\n\n30.A total of Kshs. 646,000 (344.000 + 84,000 + 218,000) was approved by the Managing Director, Mr. Orumoi. as Imprest and taken by the Head of Credit, Ms. Nora Ratemo that was to be used to bribe KNAO Auditors during their visits to TFC projects in three regions Western Circuit (344.000), North Eastern Circuit. (84,000) and Coast Circuit (218.000) in the month of October 2019 (Evidence 12).\n\n31. Ms. Ratemo has never submitted any receipts to account for the imprets taken despite having taken the imprets through the Cash Officer, Mr. Richard Oira.\n\n32.The Managing Director did not question the huge amount of imprets he approved and being taken by Ms. Ratemo because it was a plan agreed between the two that the KNAO auditors need to be bribed.\n\n33.What business does Cash Officer. Mr. Oira has on Credit Department site visits with KNAO Auditors if not to carry the money and be used to distribute to the Auditors. The four auditors in question are Judy, Ebby. Martin and David.\n\n34.The Head of Credit need to explain why she made the Corporation incur SGR cost of Kshs. 18.000 for the KNAO Auditors while travelling to Mombasa.\n\n35.

The following irregularities were committed: (i) The basis for determining the appeal court legal fees of Kshs. 11,142,436 was totally wrong as it amounted to double payment to MMC Africa Advocates as they had been paid Kshs. Kshs. 10.362.095.</p>\n\n<p>(ii) MMC Africa Advocates remitted a total of Kshs. 27,526,020 to the Corporation instead of the Kshs. 41,095.376.04 in the Credit Bank Account having retained Kshs.12,939.636 (11.142.436 + 1.797.200) as MMC Africa Advocates expenses.</p>\n\n<p>(iii) The two legal fees invoices amounting to Kshs.12,939.636 (11,142,436 + 1,797,200) was irregularly retained and withdrawn by MMC Africa Advocates as their expenses.</p>\n\n<p>(iv) The expenses of Kshs. 12.939.636 was not disclosed to the Corporation Finance Department and it is not included in the 2018/19 Financial Statements approved. This understated expenses in the Financial Statements. (v) The interest income earned at the Credit Bank Limited of Kshs. 10.942.376.04 has not been disclosed to Finance Department and was not included in the 2018/19 Financial Statements. hence understating of income declared.</p>\n\n<figure><img src=\"https://i0.wp.com/kenyanbulletin.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/TFC.jpg?resize=480%2C360&amp;ssl=1\" alt=\"\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\"><figcaption><p>Jonah Orumoi, Managing Director TFC.

Mr. Karia authorized the MMC to retain as per the correspondences.</p>\n\n<p>(ix) The Corporation therefore cannot account for the Interest Income of Kshs. 10.942.376 earned at the Credit Bank Limited and the legal fees expense of Kshs. 12.939.636 expensed by the MMC Africa Advocates.</p>\n\n<figure><img src=\"https://i1.wp.com/kenyanbulletin.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/2.jpg?resize=1080%2C1165&amp;ssl=1\" alt=\"\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\"><figcaption><p>Ms. Nora Ratemo, Head of Credit</p></figcaption></figure>\n\n<p>16. On 14th January 2015. TFC transferred Kshs. 30.153 million to the joint account of both lawyers at Credit Bank as directed by the Court of Appeal. However, when the Sundowner Lawyers were paid their dues after the Court of Appeal set aside the Kshs. 30 million awarded, the MMC transferred all the remaining money to their accounts. Kshs. 41.095.376.04 on 9th October 2019. This was to facilitate the sharing of the loot.</p>\n\n<p>17. It was illegal for the MMC to transfer TFC money into their private account instead the total money should have been transferred straight to TFC accounts. This was in full knowledge of the Managing Director, Mr. Orumoi.</p>\n\n<p>18. This is purely abuse of public office and misappropriation of public resources by the Managing Director, Mr. Orumoi Jonah and Head of Legal Services, Mr. John Karia who conspired with the MMC Africa Advocates not to remit the entire amounts to the Corporation accounts and failure to adhere to clearly laid down financial procedures on recognizing revenues, interest income and expenses. and legal fees.</p>\n\n<p>19. MMC has been paid double by TFC for this Court case, with the second payments of Kshs. 11,142,436 and Kshs. 1.797.200 being loot shared between TFC officers (Mr. Orumoi and Mr. Karia) and MMC.</p>\n\n<p>20.The Acting Head of Finance (Mr. John Mukuna) can attest to the fact that TFC in May 2015 paid legal fee of Kshs. 10.362.095 to MMC for defending the Corporation in Sundowner court case claim of Kshs. 421 million.</p>\n\n<figure><img src=\"https://i1.wp.com/kenyanbulletin.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/1.jpg?resize=1041%2C1250&amp;ssl=1\" alt=\"\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\"><figcaption><p>Mr. John Karia. the Head of Legal Services &amp; Corporation is also Company Secretary</p></figcaption></figure>\n\n<p><strong>B: ABUSE OF PUBLIC OFFICE BY HEAD OF LEGAL SERVICES.

Golf Hotel, Sunset Hotel, Kabarnet Hotel and Mt. Elgon Lodge. He has been receiving sitting allowance while attending Board meetings for the subsidiaries for the purpose of taking minutes. He is not a director in any of the subsidiary and not entitled to any sitting allowance. He has been assisted to get the sitting allowance from subsidiaries by the Managing Director. Jonan Orumoi because they all come from the same tribe. Maasai.</p>\n\n<p>22.A case in point is that the Kenya National Audit Office has queried Mr. John Karia irregular sitting allowance at Kenya Safari Lodges &amp; Hotels amounting to Kshs. 404,000 (Up to June 2019) not to mention the other four subsidiaries sitting allowance he has been receiving (Evidence 9).</p>\n\n<p><img src=\"https://www.uhondonews.com/wp-content/plugins/embed-any-document/images/loading.svg\" alt=\"Loader\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tLoading...</p>\n\n<p>23.Apart from getting sitting allowance from Kenya Safari Lodges &amp; Hotels. Mr. John Karia has also been getting sitting allowances and night out allowances in other TFC subsidiaries where he is the Company Secretary. including Sunset Hotel Limited, Golf Hotel Limited Kakamega, Kabarnet Hotel Limited and Mt. Elgon Lodge Limited. These are all illegal payments as he is not a Director of these companies but Company Secretary and on TFC payroll as an employee.</p>\n\n<p>24.0n 26th October 2019. Mr. Karia received Kshs. 14.000 (net tax of Kshs. 6.000) when attended the Board meeting of Sunset Hotel Limited which was an irregular payment as he attend in the capacity of company secretary and not Sunset Hotel Director(Evidence 10).</p>\n\n<p>25.0n 17th January 2020, Mr. Karia received a total of Kshs. 38.200 received (Kshs. 20,000 as sitting allowance and Kshs. 18,200 as night out allowance) when he attended Mt. Elgon Lodge Limited. This is an irregular payment of Kshs. 38.200 as Mr. Karia attended the Board meeting in the capacity of Company Secretary and not a Director of Mt. Elgon Lodge Limited. Even to make matters worse, the amount received by Mr. Karia was inclusive of KRA taxes of Kshs. 6,000. This was contained in a Memo Ref: TFC/INV/12 dated 13th January 2020 that was approved by the Managing Director. Mr. Orumoi knowingly that Mr. Karia in only entitled to a per diem allowance of Kshs. 10.600 per day and not Kshs. 38.200. This was paid from TFC accounts. This is the collusion that is going on at TFC between Mr. Karia and Mr. Orumoi to siphon TFC resources (Evidence 11).</p>\n\n<p><img src=\"https://www.uhondonews.com/wp-content/plugins/embed-any-document/images/loading.svg\" alt=\"Loader\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tLoading...</p>\n\n<p>26.

Mr. Karia is paid both the sitting allowance of Kshs. 20,000 and night out allowance of Kshs. 18.200 from TFC accounts for attending Kabarnet Hotel Board meetings as Company Secretary for the last 2 years. He should only be paid per diem of Kshs. 10,600 per day.</p>\n\n<p>28.Mr. Karia for the last two years has received over Kshs. 1.5 million both as sitting allowance and night out allowance for attending board meetings of subsidiaries as Company Secretary which is highly irregular payments and abuse of public office. Instead he should be paid per diem as it has been the case when he has been taking the TFC Board for project visits or retreats.</p>\n\n<p>29. Evidences 9, 10 and 11 are only samples of the graft going on at TFC with Mr. Orumoi and his fellow maasai Mr. Karia.</p>\n\n<figure><img src=\"https://i0.wp.com/kenyanbulletin.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/tourism-finance.jpg?resize=1170%2C780&amp;ssl=1\" alt=\"\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\"><figcaption><p>Why these many agencies?
