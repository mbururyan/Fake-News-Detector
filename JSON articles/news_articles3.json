The engineers put up small culverts instead of putting up a full bridge or a box bridge,\u201d said Nyaguti.\n\nThe residents estimates indicate that close to 200 people use the bridge on a daily basis to go to hospital in Usoma, and shop and market at the Otonglo market centre.\n\nCurrently, one has to use a boat in order to cross the bridge, with boat operators charging between Sh10 and Sh50 for each cross over.\n\n\u201cSchool going children cannot use this route from Usoma to Nawa. The government should help us by constructing this bridge,\u201d said Hellen Achieng Odhiambo.\n\nHer sentiments were echoed by Maurice Otieno who said the collapse of the bridge has hampered many social activities in the villages.\n\n\u201cWe appeal for the construction of this bridge.
