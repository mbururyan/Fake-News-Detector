You can bet on Arsenal matches using the Betika app, as well as monitor the chances of the contenders for the coveted position.<br>\n3. <strong>Arsene Wenger</strong> \u2013 unlikely! But some fans certainly wish they had the Frenchman.<br>\nIf Emery had been fired earlier, then a possible option would be the appointment of Jose Mourinho, but Tottenham managed to get him first. So far, the team is led by former club player Freddy Lungberg, who has started not in the best possible way as well.</li></ol>\n\n<p><strong>Latest Arsenal results in Betyetu app</strong></p>\n\n<p>The only bright spot of the season for the London club is the Europa League, where they have been winning but with some so-so series of matches at the end of October when Arsenal barely outplayed Guimaraes with the score of 3:2. After that, the club was kicked out of the English League Cup in the loss to Liverpool. The match had an abundance of goals scored and many exciting moments, which you could bet on with the <a href=\"https://app.info.ke/betyetu-app-download-on-mobile/\">Betyetu app</a>.</p>\n\n<p>Despite the small gap between the positions, it will be very difficult for Arsenal to compete at least for the fifth place, which makes it possible to play in the Europa League. It is this tournament that can allow the Gunners to participate in UCL competition next season but only on the condition that the team gets to the finals and win. With such a performance, this is rather doubtful, but the fans believe in progress. Most even bet on the success of the team in the Betyetu app. Moreover, the current participants of the Europa League are quite serious, and the playoffs are going to be interesting like the Champions League\u2019s finals.</p>\n\n</article>", "canonicalUrl": "http://zipo.co.ke/42833/bet-on-london-arsenal-in-betika-app/"},{"url": "http://zipo.co.ke/42816/sonko-to-spend-more-nights-in-jail/", "probability": 0.9408253, "headline": "Sonko to spend more time in JAIL", "datePublished": "2019-12-11T19:40:53+00:00", "datePublishedRaw": "2019-12-11T19:40:53+00:00", "dateModified": "2019-12-13T14:55:53+03:00", "dateModifiedRaw": "2019-12-13T14:55:53+03:00", "author": "Zipo writer", "authorsList": ["Zipo writer"], "inLanguage": "en", "breadcrumbs": [{"name": "Home", "link": "http://zipo.co.ke/"}, {"name": "News", "link": "http://zipo.co.ke/category/news/"}], "mainImage": "http://zipo.co.ke/wp-content/uploads/2019/12/Mike-Sonko_court-2-s.jpg", "images": ["http://zipo.co.ke/wp-content/uploads/2019/12/Mike-Sonko_court-2-s-640x427.jpg", "http://zipo.co.ke/wp-content/uploads/2019/12/Mike-Sonko_Al-Jazeera.jpg", "http://zipo.co.ke/wp-content/uploads/2019/12/Mike-Sonko_court-5.jpg"], "description": "Nairobi governor Mike Sonko is not out of the woods yet as more nights await him in police cells while his bail gets processed.
