"Anyone who has a holiday home or flat would love to have it fully booked all through the year.\n\nWith travelling abroad still seen as risky, many Kenyans will be holidaying locally during the coming holidays instead of going overseas.\n\nHow do you make your vacation rental stand out so that people notice it when they\u2019re booking online? And, that once they\u2019ve stayed there, they\u2019ll love it so much they\u2019ll definitely recommend it to others?\n\nIdeally, you\u2019ll want your Airbnb to grab attention, but also look like a welcoming space where people can relax and enjoy being together. You want every aspect of their stay there to ooze memories and good times.\n\nFirst impressions count\n\nThe front of your holiday house is the first thing guests will see when they arrive, so it\u2019s integral to make a great impression.\n\nA pretty welcome sign, the name of your holiday home or painting the front door a cheerful colour will all give an instant holiday vibe. Planting flowers, or having them in pots, at the front door will also create a welcoming feel.\n\nA warm welcome\n\nHave a welcome pack with a small selection of treats and visitor information waiting for guests upon their arrival. They\u2019ll love it, and will remember it in their recommendations of your property to others.\n\nFresh bread and milk in the fridge for the first night\u2019s stay will be so appreciated, as will little touches like dog snacks for pet-friendly homes, and mini-toiletries in the bathroom.\n\nCreate a guide with expert tips on your area \u2013 great coffee spots and bakeries, must-try restaurants and wine bars, shopping hotspots and touristy must-sees.\n\nA handy list of close by supermarkets, doctors and pharmacies will be convenient, too. Try an online design programme like Canva to put your guide together and make it look professional.\n\nNobody wants ordinary\n\nWhen you\u2019re decorating a space for holiday guests, it\u2019s tempting to tone it down so that the d\u00e9cor will appeal to all, but remember that people want wow. Guests want a space that feels like a home from home but they\u2019re also paying for an experience. Colour, beautiful art, a stand-out furniture piece, deep-pile rugs in the bedroom or a luxe addition like a log fireplace or a jacuzzi will be memorable (and romantic!).\n\nIf your home is surrounded by beautiful scenery, invest in floor-length glass windows or doors for views that will really sell your holiday home. Never fall into the trap of choosing cheap d\u00e9cor items, or worse still, decorating a space with the things you don\u2019t want at home. Old, cheap and boring are to be avoided at all costs. When people walk into your holiday rental they want to find the equivalent, or better, than what they have at home.\n\nWhat guests want\n\nEvaluate every part of your holiday space and think about what you can do to make your guests\u2019 experience memorable. The living room must have a cosy place where they can relax and read a book or watch a movie and, if possible, a smart TV.\n\nIn the kitchen, make sure there\u2019s everything that guests need to easily be able to self-cater. If you can, add in luxe touches such as an espresso machine or a smoothie maker. It\u2019s things like this people will tell their friends about.\n\nSuperior service\n\nHolidaymakers want to relax and spend their time making fun memories, so make sure they get the time to do that at your rental by providing a cleaning service.\n\nAd hoc bookings may mean you don\u2019t need a regular service, so opt for one like SweepSouth, a handy on-demand home service that allows you to book reliable, trustworthy cleaners when you need them. Gardeners to spruce up your outside area can be booked on the site too.\n\nCreate a photo-worthy backdrop\n\nPeople love taking photos of themselves in a beautiful holiday setting and sharing them with those back home. Create an appealing photo-worthy scene in one of the main living spaces.\n\nIt can be a stylish area with smart wallpaper and an ornamental mirror, a serene space in the garden or quirky corner at the entrance featuring something that resonates with the location you\u2019re in, like a local artwork or an attractive grouping of photos of local landmarks.\n\nA bedroom sanctuary\n\nSpending time and effort on making your master bedroom into a tranquil sanctuary is well worth it. You want a guest to feel pampered the moment they walk in and see plush pillows and plump quilts on a big, comfy bed that promises a fantastic night\u2019s sleep.\n\nBuy the best mattress you can afford, and provide soft-to-the-touch quality linen and bedding.\n\nMake this haven of relaxation that much more luxurious with air-conditioning, block-out curtains or blinds, soft rugs and laundry hampers. Think about your guests\u2019 expectations and exceed them.\n\nLight it right\n\nDone right, lighting can add so much to the feel of a room. Fabulous lamps or wall sconces in the bedroom, charming pendants in the kitchen and a large standing lamp in the sitting room will add real presence.\n\nOutdoor delight\n\nIf you have an outdoor space, make it an oasis for guests to spend time in. Even small areas can be made delightful with the addition of water features, hammocks, daybeds and canopies. If you can care for it, plant a vegetable or herb patch that guests can help themselves to.\n\nPhoto perfect\n\nLastly, get great photos of your rental. When people scroll through listings on holiday accommodation sites, think about what your photos will look like and whether they\u2019ll catch the eye of a holidaymaker, resulting in more bookings.

That\u2019s why inexperienced players should always test the waters and play games in demo mode, a feature only found in online casinos.</p>\n\n<p>Free play lets you try online slots, roulette, blackjack, and others without investing real money. It\u2019s the best way to see which games you like, what strategy works best for you, etc. You should never be in a hurry to gamble real money, whether you\u2019re playing online or in a land-based casino.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Pace of Choice\n</strong></p>\n\n<p>Brick-and-mortar casinos can be a chaotic environment, which is unsuitable for inexperienced players. Dealers dictate the pace, and you must follow them to stay in the game. This can sometimes lead to making the wrong decision and losing.</p>\n\n<p>On the other hand, online casinos allow you to decide how much time you need to place a bet in blackjack or spin a reel in slots. Gambling online can be a tailor-made experience, allowing you to enjoy the games in all their glory.</p>\n\n</article>", "canonicalUrl": "https://www.nairobileo.co.ke/news/5518/benefits-of-playing-in-online-casinos-in-kenya"},{"url": "https://www.nairobileo.co.ke/news/5517/controversial-lawyer-miguna-message-to-babu-owino-after-court-ruling", "probability": 0.9903965, "headline": "Miguna Speaks After DJ Evolve Withdrew Attempted Murder Case Against Babu Owino", "datePublished": "2021-12-14T16:26:49.376019", "datePublishedRaw": "18 hours ago", "author": "Dennis Kamau", "authorsList": ["Dennis Kamau"], "inLanguage": "en", "breadcrumbs": [{"name": "Home", "link": "https://www.nairobileo.co.ke/"}, {"name": "News", "link": "https://www.nairobileo.co.ke/news"}, {"name": "Miguna Speaks After DJ Evolve Withdrew Attempted Murder Case Against Babu Owino"}], "mainImage": "https://www.nairobileo.co.ke/uploads/posts/IMG-20211214184949.jpg", "images": ["https://www.nairobileo.co.ke/uploads/posts/IMG-20211214184949.jpg", "https://www.nairobileo.co.ke/uploads/posts/IMG-20201016174731.jpg"], "description": "Miguna expressed his dissatisfaction with the development saying Babu Owino's case has set a bad precedent in the quest for justice against the powerful.", "articleBody": "Lawyer Miguna Miguna has weighed in on the acquittal of Embakasi East MP Babu Owino from an attempted murder case pitting him and deejay Felix Orinda, alias Dj Evolve.\n\nIn a tweet, Miguna expressed his dissatisfaction with the development saying the MP's case has set a bad precedent in the quest for justice against the powerful in society.\n\nAccording to Miguna, Babu Owino's case has opened the stage for the powerful in society to commit an offence with an assurance that they can buy their way out.\n\n\"You are free to shoot, maim and kill any Kenyan with no wealth and power.

A trendsetter named Top 40 Under 40 Most Influential Women in Kenya in 2011; the only woman in public service at the time to get such recognition.\n\nAn economist, she describes herself as a pragmatic leader and diligent public servant who always upholds excellence in performance.\n\nShe was elected Governor of Kirinyaga County in 2017, in a tightly contested gubernatorial election where she emerged as one of the first three women Governors in Kenya.\n\n1. Briefly introduce yourself. Who is Anne Waiguru?\n\nI am a woman who believes that women have what it takes to take up the roles in the highest levels of their country\u2019s public and corporate leadership.\n\nCurrently, I am spearheading the socio-economic and political development for one of the country\u2019s vibrant devolved units inhabited by approximately 610,000 people. I am also a wife and a mother.\n\n2. Talk to us about your career journey highlighting the significant achievements and the events around them?\n\nMany know me from serving in the public sector but before this, I worked at Citibank, the World Bank, and in Civil Society specifically at Transparency International-Kenya, where I was a principal research analyst and a consultant for the National Council of NGOs and the Kenya Human Rights Commission (KHRC).\n\nIn the mainstream public service, I served as a technical advisor during President Mwai Kibaki\u2019s Government on secondment by the World Bank, and later by the United Nations Development Program (UNDP). Thereafter, I joined the National Treasury as Head of Governance, where I also served as the alternate to the Permanent Secretary of the National Treasury in the Women Enterprise Fund Board and the Public Procurement Oversight Authority and Advisory Board.\n\nLater, I was appointed Head of the Economic Stimulus Programme and the Director of Integrated Financial Management System (IFMIS) between 2007 and 2012. Through sheer hard work at the National Treasury, I led the IFMIS team to win three awards for exemplary performance and was named among the Top 40 Under 40 Most Influential Women in Kenya in 2011; the only woman in public service at the time to get such recognition.\n\nThen in April 2013, I transitioned into President Uhuru Kenyatta\u2019s Government as the first Devolution Cabinet Secretary. I was tasked with the responsibility of overseeing the country\u2019s shift from a centralized to a devolved system of Government. As Devolution CS, I won a total of 15 awards in Africa and globally, including the 2015 United Nations Public Service Award following recognition by the Africa Association of Public Administration and Management, for ensuring efficiency in Public Service delivery and introducing one-stop service delivery centres called Huduma Centres.\n\nKenyans can attest that Huduma centres have eased access to Government services, such as registration of business entities, application for e-driving licenses, application and replacement of lost identity cards, and other related public services.\n\nGiven the need to ensure women as part of the marginalized people were empowered economically, I successfully championed the reservation of 30% Government contracts for marginalized groups, which is now a legally recognized general principle of procurement and asset disposal in Kenya and is implemented through Access to Government Procurement Opportunities (AGPO).\n\nImmediately after the 2017 General elections, I was elected Vice-Chairperson of the Council of Governors (CoGs) where I played a major role in negotiations between the national Governments and county Governments due to my past work experience.\n\n3. With such an accomplished career life, paint for us a picture of what it means to be a woman in a Senior Management role in Politics and Governance; a sector that many women easily shy away from.\n\nTo be a woman in a senior management in politics and governance takes commitment and hard work. Like many women leaders across the globe and Kenya in particular, I have often had to work twice or thrice as hard to clinch any position dominated by men.\n\nFor instance, when I fronted my name for Vice-Chairperson of the Council of Governors against three other male candidates, in a room full of 44 men and only two other women, I had to put up a strong case that would persuade the newly elected male Governors to elect me.\n\nIn my political life, I have also had to deal with the ills of negative publicity fuelled by political opponents who believed I was rising faster than a woman should. Social media has made it even harder as the rate at which information, true or false, is disseminated is very fast. To make matters worse, the arguments against women often focus on mundane issues such as their physical looks rather than on their ideas and leadership capabilities.\n\nHowever, these challenges fuel my drive, my undoubted resilience, commitment to excellence, and ability to deliver complex tasks. Now I can say that the experience has elevated me to the level I am in. I believe that transformative leadership should be focused on influencing positive change in individuals and social systems that have hindered gender equality.\n\nI am currently serving as the Chairperson of the Gender, Youth, Sports, Culture, and Social services committee at the Council of Governors. I believe that women leaders should band together to achieve equality in the social-economic and political landscapes in our countries.\n\n4. From your experience over the years, how would you encourage women to a greater awareness that they can break barriers, influence, and occupy decision-making positions?\n\nIn my perspective, gender equality can no longer be a footnote. All women must commit to contribute towards an equitable and inclusive Kenya where we get enough women believing in themselves and coming out to fight for their spaces.\n\nWomen leadership is still greatly hampered by many obstacles including blatant and subtle attitudes and beliefs that women cannot reach leadership domains traditionally assigned to men.\n\nEven though there has been quite some progress towards achieving gender parity, much more still needs to be done to have more women elected into political offices. As it is currently, women have to put in much more effort in convincing the electorate to elect them than their male counterparts.\n\nMy advice to the women is, however, not to shy away from dreaming to achieve their leadership goals. They must believe they have what it takes to bring tangible change in areas that affect them since they understand better the unique interests of women and girls. We must find a common ground that will help us bring new dignity and respect to women and girls.\n\nOffering mentorship to women is therefore, critical towards the achievement of gender equality since it not only opens doors for them to break the glass ceiling but it ignites the fire and the push for them to achieve their maximum potential.\n\nIt also means that there will be more women moving up which forms the foundation of a valuable professional network that will benefit women and enhance advocacy on their issues at high levels.\n\n5. Let\u2019s talk about women\u2019s empowerment. As a champion for gender equity in society, how do you go about encouraging women to achieve their highest potential?\n\nResponding to the need to ensure increased active participation of more women leaders in Kenya, I have been a champion of constitutional reforms that would enable us to comply with the two-thirds (2/3) gender rule entrenched in the country\u2019s current 2010 Constitution.\n\nIn the current constitutional regime, the two-thirds gender rule has been deemed unimplementable for the absence of mechanisms on how to realize the principle in appointive and elective positions. I have been actively engaged as a key strategist to ensure that women are equally engaged on all fronts for the key purpose of ensuring their holistic development. It is a trite fact that a nation is empowered when its women, young and old alike, are empowered.\n\n6. You say that your purpose in life is to grow people with energy and to inspire them to unleash their potential. Briefly tell us some of the ways you have done so and key lessons you have learnt while living out your purpose.\n\n\u2756 Transformative leadership is about influencing positive change in individuals and social systems for the betterment of society. My current capacity as Governor allows me to actively advocate for the interests of the public within the region, I govern concerning devolved functions.\n\nUpon assumption of office after the 2017 elections, I developed a Sessional Paper dubbed The Mountain Cities Blueprint 2032 which captured my agenda and vision for the county. Through it, we have been undertaking wealth-creation development programs whose tangible benefits to the public are now evident.\n\n\u2756 We, therefore, developed an end-to-end economic stimulus program that we named Wezesha which is a Kiswahili name meaning \u2018empower\u2019. Through Wezesha we have so far supported more than 500 farmers groups and close to 50,000 households to undertake various projects. Each of the supported households makes an extra Ksh. 1,000 per day under various value chains which include production of 1 million eggs a month under poultry keeping, tomato, avocado, dairy and fish farming, beekeeping as well as pig rearing.\n\n\u2756 To provide a conducive environment for our traders, most of who deal in fresh produce, we have so far constructed 15 modern markets in various towns. To transform our urban centres, we have also constructed about 25,000 square meters of cabro car parks and pavements in our major towns such as Kerugoya, Kutus, Kagio, Kianyaga and currently we are undertaking 30,000 square meters of cabro paving in Wang\u2019uru town.\n\n\u2756 Towards the achievement of Universal Health Coverage, we have undertaken massive infrastructural and service delivery reforms in our health facilities. Our legacy project in health is the upcoming five-storey ultra-modern medical complex that aims at elevating Kerugoya Level Four Hospital to a Level Five Referral Hospital. This facility will enable us to offer the specialized medical services for which residents are currently referred to other hospitals.\n\nThe ultra-modern hospital, which has an ICU, an HDU, an oncology centre and a burns unit among other state-of-the-art amenities, will be the first one in the region to match the standards of some of the country\u2019s most reputable private hospitals.\n\nWe are also upgrading Kimbimbi and Kianyaga Hospitals from level 3 to level 4 facilities. This is in addition to the 19 dispensaries we are completing and equipping to boost the provision of primary healthcare at the grassroots.\n\n7. If you were to reflect on your career journey, what would you say has been the guiding principle(s) or values that keep you grounded in life?\n\nMy unshakable commitment to good governance against great odds, democracy, transformative learning, human rights, the right to excellent service delivery, and the rule of law drive my decisions as a civil servant, a political leader, and in my personal life.\n\n8. Away from work, share with us some of your life experiences on personal growth and development?\n\nHaving been selected to join the Amujae Leader in the 2021 Cohort, at Ellen Johnson Sirleaf Presidential Center for Women and Leadership (EJS Center) earlier in the year, I am learning a lot from my mentors such as Ellen Johnson who has been the President in Liberia. I cherish every opportunity that equips me with the confidence required to seek the highest positions of public leadership.\n\nThe program is designed to address the underrepresentation of women in public leadership in Africa and ensure that women become equal players in setting the national priorities of their respective countries.\n\nI am committed to playing my role in mentoring other young women in leadership and politics. I want to be counted among the women who have positively impacted Africa women leadership.\n\nAny parting shot?\n\nIt is said that, if you are not on the table, you are on the menu. Women have been on the menu for far too long, and for us who are on the table now, we should make it count! We should also be the voice for the voiceless and hope for those who have lost hope. When all said and done, let it be remembered that Kenyan women fought for their right to be included in spaces that matter.", "articleBodyHtml": "<article>\n\n<p>In our segment of #KenyaWomenSeries, we feature, Governor Anne Waiguru.

Each of the supported households makes an extra Ksh. 1,000 per day under various value chains which include production of 1 million eggs a month under poultry keeping, tomato, avocado, dairy and fish farming, beekeeping as well as pig rearing.</p>\n\n<p>\u2756\tTo provide a conducive environment for our traders, most of who deal in fresh produce, we have so far constructed 15 modern markets in various towns. To transform our urban centres, we have also constructed about 25,000 square meters of cabro car parks and pavements in our major towns such as Kerugoya, Kutus, Kagio, Kianyaga and currently we are undertaking 30,000 square meters of cabro paving in Wang\u2019uru town.</p>\n\n<p>\u2756\tTowards the achievement of Universal Health Coverage, we have undertaken massive infrastructural and service delivery reforms in our health facilities. Our legacy project in health is the upcoming five-storey ultra-modern medical complex that aims at elevating Kerugoya Level Four Hospital to a Level Five Referral Hospital. This facility will enable us to offer the specialized medical services for which residents are currently referred to other hospitals.</p>\n\n<p>The ultra-modern hospital, which has an ICU, an HDU, an oncology centre and a burns unit among other state-of-the-art amenities, will be the first one in the region to match the standards of some of the country\u2019s most reputable private hospitals.</p>\n\n<p>We are also upgrading Kimbimbi and Kianyaga Hospitals from level 3 to level 4 facilities. This is in addition to the 19 dispensaries we are completing and equipping to boost the provision of primary healthcare at the grassroots.</p>\n\n<p>7.<strong> If you were to reflect on your career journey, what would you say has been the guiding principle(s) or values that keep you grounded in life? \n</strong></p>\n\n<p>My unshakable commitment to good governance against great odds, democracy, transformative learning, human rights, the right to excellent service delivery, and the rule of law drive my decisions as a civil servant, a political leader, and in my personal life.</p>\n\n<p>8. <strong>Away from work, share with us some of your life experiences on personal growth and development?\n</strong></p>\n\n<p>Having been selected to join the Amujae Leader in the 2021 Cohort, at Ellen Johnson Sirleaf Presidential Center for Women and Leadership (EJS Center) earlier in the year, I am learning a lot from my mentors such as Ellen Johnson who has been the President in Liberia. I cherish every opportunity that equips me with the confidence required to seek the highest positions of public leadership.</p>\n\n<p>The program is designed to address the underrepresentation of women in public leadership in Africa and ensure that women become equal players in setting the national priorities of their respective countries.</p>\n\n<p>I am committed to playing my role in mentoring other young women in leadership and politics. I want to be counted among the women who have positively impacted Africa women leadership.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Any parting shot?\n</strong></p>\n\n<p>It is said that, if you are not on the table, you are on the menu. Women have been on the menu for far too long, and for us who are on the table now, we should make it count!  We should also be the voice for the voiceless and hope for those who have lost hope. When all said and done, let it be remembered that Kenyan women fought for their right to be included in spaces that matter.</p>\n\n</article>", "canonicalUrl": "https://www.nairobileo.co.ke/opinions/5224/from-serving-in-kibaki-uhuru-government-to-kirinyaga-governor-the-story-of-anne-waiguru"},{"url": "https://www.nairobileo.co.ke/news/5085/psc-announces-candidates-shortlisted-for-internships-here-is-how-to-check", "probability": 0.9900691, "headline": "PSC Announces Candidates Shortlisted for Internships : Here is How to Check", "datePublished": "2021-11-17T10:27:07.441679", "datePublishedRaw": "4 weeks ago", "author": "Dennis Kamau", "authorsList": ["Dennis Kamau"], "inLanguage": "en", "breadcrumbs": [{"name": "Home", "link": "https://www.nairobileo.co.ke/"}, {"name": "News", "link": "https://www.nairobileo.co.ke/news"}, {"name": "PSC Announces Candidates Shortlisted for Internships : Here is How to Check"}], "mainImage": "https://www.nairobileo.co.ke/uploads/posts/IMG-20211112102157.jpg", "images": ["https://www.nairobileo.co.ke/uploads/posts/IMG-20211112102157.jpg", "https://www.nairobileo.co.ke/uploads/posts/IMG-20210914110033.PNG"], "description": "The program is an initiative by the Government of Kenya to ensure that the youth get to be competent in the Kenyan job market with skills.", "articleBody": "The Public Service Commission has announced the list of successful candidates shortlisted for internship positions advertised on August 3.\n\nIn a notice issued on Tuesday, November 16, PSC noted that those qualified for the Public Service Internship Program(PSIP) positions would get telephone interviews scheduled from Wednesday, November 17, until November 19.\n\nThe program is an initiative by the Government of Kenya to ensure that the youth get to be competent in the Kenyan job market with skills.\n\n\"Interviews through the telephone for the shortlisted candidates are scheduled to take place from Wednesday, November 17, to November 19, 2021, starting at 8:00 am.\n\n\"All the shortlisted candidates are required to have with them the following documents: National Identity card/Passport and Academic /Professional Certificates,\" read the statement in part.\n\nSuccessful candidate will get a monthly stipend determined by the PSC during their 12 months of work.\n\nAt the end of their internship program, each candidate will be awarded a certificate as they stand a chance to be absorbed into various government parastatals and ministries.", "articleBodyHtml": "<article>\n\n<p>The Public Service Commission has announced the list of successful candidates shortlisted for\u00a0 internship positions advertised on August 3.</p>\n\n<p>In a notice issued on Tuesday, November 16, PSC noted that those qualified for the Public Service Internship Program(PSIP) positions would get telephone interviews scheduled from Wednesday, November 17, until November 19.</p>\n\n<p>The program is an initiative by the Government of Kenya to ensure that the youth get to be competent in the Kenyan job market with skills.</p>\n\n<figure><img src=\"https://www.nairobileo.co.ke/uploads/posts/IMG-20210914110033.PNG\"><figcaption>An undated image of Public Service Commission (PSC) offices in Nairobi.

They are very popular among millennials, coming in at number two.This is unsurprising as this was the audience they started with when they first came into the music scene.

Eight out of the 10 most streamed artists by this group are all rappers. After Drake, the second most popular rapper, and only female artist in the list, is Doja Cat.

This, however, proved a challenge as most school heads feared angering President Moi.\n\nTheir grandfather, the late Jaramogi Oginga, intervened and they were admitted at Consolata Primary School in Westlands. It was here that she changed her faith from the Anglican Church to Roman Catholic.\n\nDuring an interview with Nation on April 10, 2016, Rosemary narrated that they spent little time with their father as he was always in and out of detention.\n\nKids from their class were afraid to interact with them and their house was raided and ransacked so many times. Their mother, who was their sole breadwinner, also suffered several arrests.\n\n\"However, we were very close to my siblings.

The foundation aimed at supporting youth Education across East Africa.\n\nRosemary also joined her father\u2019s presidential campaign team in 2007, a role she played again in 2013 when she was a member of the lobby group called Nairobi for Raila.\n\nIn 2017, she intended to contest the Kibera Constituency parliamentary seat but was forced to shelve her political ambitions due to a medical problem.\n\nIllness\n\nThe mother of two suffered two aneurysms, a brain tumor, and a stroke. An aneurysm is an enlargement of an artery caused by weakness in the arterial wall.\n\nThe tumor affected her eyesight and she visited hospitals outside the country as she sought treatment.\n\nDuring an interview with Citizen TV on Sunday, December 16, 2018, Rosemary narrated the struggles she underwent while on the brink of losing her sight.\n\n\u201cSometimes I would find myself crying wondering what I should do. I just realised that suddenly I can\u2019t drive my car, I cannot cook the food I want to. I felt helpless that I cannot do things by myself,\u201d she narrated.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t really see out of the left eye.

She is passionate about producing and working on the show is her favourite part.\n\nSpeaking to a local daily in December 2019, she intimated that her father named her 'Mamou' from the song Mamou by legendary Congolese artist Franco.\n\nShe grew up in a house where Rhumba was the most popular genre of music, and as a result, she became a fan.\n\n\"My father got our names from the music he listened to. My siblings also have Lingala names. Whenever my father saw me, he would sing the song Mamou by Franco, word for word.\n\n\"He loved the name and that's how I was named Mamou.

It was awesome, I used to look up to it. When I came to Citizen, I would see Uncle Fred pass by and I would look up to personally meeting him,\" she stated.\n\nWhile it is a dream come true to work with Uncle Machoka, Mamou notes that they at times differ due to the selection of music.\n\nShe stated that at times, he might play music she feels secludes the younger generation and vice versa.\n\n\"But what I like most about Uncle Fred is that if you wrong him, he will tell it to you. Most importantly, he would not let you do the next show without reconciliation,\" Mamou said.\n\n\"He sits me down, tells me I don't like what you did, this is what we should do, this we shouldn't do.\n\n\"It was hard at first but getting to know him, he has taught me to be patient, how to relate with people,\" she added.\n\nSince joining the show, Mamou's effort is to make Roga Roga a place where a young person can run the show and people can relate to the show.\n\nThey have occasionally had young people stand-in for the show when Uncle is not available.
