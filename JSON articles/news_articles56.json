Strangely though I was very much at peace with myself and my God.\" - Ronnie Osumba", "articleBody": "Former presidential running mate Ronnie Osumba has shared memories of the day he almost lost his life.\n\nIn a social media post, Ronnie - who was a running mate for Peter Kenneth in 2013 recalled how his 2018 was a busy year.\n\nCome January 9, 2019, Ronnie Osumba fell ill.\n\n\"The night before I went to bed, struggling with my body, but in my mind I was fatigued following a crazy schedule of 2018,\" Ronnie shared.\n\nOn that day, he planned to take his son to school then take a flight to Taita Taveta to attend a Youth function.\n\nHowever, this did not come to pass as Ronnie's health condition deteriorated.\n\nHe shared the events of the fateful day that left him admitted in hospital, and later on changed his life for good.\n\nRonnie narrated,\n\n\"The night before I went to bed, struggling with my body, but in my mind, I was fatigued following a crazy schedule of 2018 and after a few minutes at the triage, having walked in unassisted, all hell broke loose. Suddenly I was on an ER bed, doctors and nurses frantic around me, now naked and all sorts of pipes being plugged into literally every opening in my body.\n\nMy system was shutting down my kidney, liver, lungs and brain were all at different stages of shutdown. I apparently had complicated malaria manifesting through impairment of consciousness, severe anemia, haemoglobin in the urine, acute respiratory distress, low blood pressure and God knows what else.\n\nThe level of malaria parasites in my blood were at 20% (malaria kills at 3.5% infection). I needed to be treated in ICU and aggressively. I was way past the limit for demise. Long story short. Aga Khan didn't have space in ICU which meant they needed to find an alternative.\n\nIt took 6hrs to find space in an ICU within Nairobi and I ended up at Nairobi Hospital. The ambulance ride was the most depressing moment. It is the moment it hit me that I may not make it. Strangely though I was very much at peace with myself and my God.\n\nI am told it's called the 'Symptom of Imminent Death'. More pandemonium at Nairobi Hospital and finally get to ICU 13hrs after I first got to the ER in Aga Khan. I don't remember much of that evening but when I woke up in the middle of the night I actually thought.\n\nI had arrived at final destination in Heaven (Nairobi Hospital has really stepped up the game at their ICU... that's how cool it looked when I woke up). Dr. Eric Munene comes in the morning with good news that I have had a dramatic response to treatment and infection down to 17%.\n\nIt took another 5 days for levels to drop below 5% and another 10 days to be released from hospital. During the period I became 'Yule jamaa wa malaria'.

Aga Khan didn't have space in ICU which meant they needed to find an alternative. </em></p>\n\n<p><em>It took 6hrs to find space in an ICU within Nairobi and I ended up at Nairobi Hospital. The ambulance ride was the most depressing moment. It is the moment it hit me that I may not make it. Strangely though I was very much at peace with myself and my God.</em></p>\n\n<p><em>I am told it's called the 'Symptom of Imminent Death'.

You don\u2019t have to go to extremes. Both of those things will make you feel good, but you\u2019re allowed a cheat day too.\n\nHere are some simple ways to be kinder to yourself in 2022.\n\nFocus on you\n\n\u201cMe\u201d time is beneficial for physical, mental, and emotional health. Too little time to yourself can negatively impact your relationships and could potentially lead to unhealthy habits, sleep deprivation, depression or burnout.\n\nPsychologists recommend time alone for its many benefits including enhancing relationships, having time to think, properly resting the mind and unwinding from daily stresses and ultimately improving concentration, creativity and productivity.\n\nTaking time to do things for yourself can help you recharge and even boost your immune system. If you\u2019re seriously struggling to switch off for a while, practice mindfulness with meditation, go for a walk or run or find a book or recipe to focus on for a while.\n\nIn fact, lowering your stress levels, getting a good night\u2019s sleep, eating healthy meals and exercising combined is an excellent immune-boosting strategy.\n\nTidy home, tidy mind\n\nIt\u2019s scientifically proven that being surrounded by mess, dirt and clutter leads to higher stress levels. Cleaning and decluttering your space can eliminate distractions, boost motivation and create a healthier home environment.\n\nYou can double up on being kind to yourself by enlisting the help of a SweepStar through the SweepSouth app.\n\nHire in the help of someone to come in for a few hours to clean and tidy up your home, freeing you up to take a break and relax, spending time doing the things you love.\n\nThe process is quick, user- friendly and affordable. And, by doing so, says SweepSouth co-founder and CEO Aisha Pandor, you directly create work opportunities at a time when many domestic workers are struggling to find employment.\n\nPractise self-care\n\nSelf-care has been trending for a couple of years now, but there\u2019s a lot more to it than long baths, face masks and manicures. Self-care is incredibly important for mental health and can even reduce risk of heart disease, stroke or cancer. This is more than just taking \u201cme\u201d time, it\u2019s ensuring that all of your needs are met in life.\n\nThe Substance Abuse and Mental Health Services Administration (SAMHSA) in the United States identified eight dimensions of wellness: emotional, environmental, financial, intellectual, occupational, physical, social and spiritual.\n\nYour goals at the start of last year might have gone out of the window by March, but it\u2019s time for a fresh start. Even if you\u2019ve suffered setbacks, think about what you want for your life and how you can get things in motion in the year ahead.\n\nThings might still be different for a while, but it\u2019s still important to focus on your goals.\n\nBe mindful of mental health\n\nIf you are concerned about your mental health at this understandably very stressful time, don\u2019t be afraid to ask for help. There are many professionals that can equip you with the tools you need to cope with stress.\n\nThe constant barrage of news and ever-changing regulations can be extremely stressful and overwhelming for anyone, especially those with pre-existing mental health issues.\n\nAs such, it is important to \u201clearn new ways to cope and manage the stress\u201d.\n\nBe mindful of others too. You never know what internal struggles other people are going through.\n\nSpend time outdoors\n\nWe all know how good it is for us to get outdoors and breathe in the fresh air, but if your garden or outdoor area is looking neglected because you just didn\u2019t have the time or energy to maintain it, it could leave you feeling more frustrated than calm looking at it.\n\nTake the burden of tackling chores outdoors off your shoulders by hiring help - SweepSouth has recently expanded its list of services in Kenya to include handy outdoor services like cleaning your garden, windows and car.", "articleBodyHtml": "<article>\n\n<p>There\u2019s no doubt that 2021 has been a tough year for everyone.

The best thing about modelling is getting to showcase my talent, representing the country internationally and working with different brands across the Globe.\n\nAmong the brands I have worked with is Paledi Segapo from South Africa, I have also partnered with other brands but I cannot mention them at the moment.\n\nBeing a model in Kenya pays.\"\n\nBonnie says most people 'fail' by choosing the wrong niche hence end up giving modelling a bad name.\n\nHe added that for him it's more of a calling hence he balances between work and modelling.\n\nHe has modelled since his campus days and through it, all his parents have been his biggest cheerleaders.\n\n\"Modelling is diverse and you just have to know where you fit.\"\n\nMy parents have always supported me since I was in campus.
