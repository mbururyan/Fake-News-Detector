Adapting to post-pandemic realities is as challenging for children as it is for parents/adults.\n\nAs societies reopen around the world, many people are experiencing new or worsening social anxiety. Things most people used to do daily with so much as thought is now a bigger deal. Things like talking to strangers in the shop, organising a playdate, borrowing a pencil from a friend at school, ordering in cafes, have become anxiety loaded activities.\n\nWhether you were socially anxious before the pandemic or developed social anxiety as a result of being isolated, the prospect of returning to a day-to-day \u2018new-normal\u2019 life can feel daunting to even the strongest person.\n\nChildren and teenagers with social anxiety have an excessive fear of social performance situations. It creates feelings of fear for children when they need to: speak to others, read out loud, go outside, be evaluated by others. They are concerned that they may do something embarrassing, humiliating, or that others may think badly of them, making them self-conscious.\n\nAlso, children going through social anxiety after Covid-19 have added stressors that were not part of their original anxiety. According to the Big Life Journal, social anxiety is one of the most common problems that prevents children from adopting a growth mindset, trying new things and taking risks. Therefore, it is important for us as parents to support our children to navigate through their social anxieties.\n\nHere are a few tips to consider:\n\nKnowledge is power. One of the most effective things you can do is to teach your child about social anxiety. Speak openly about the topic. Understand your child\u2019s fears and with as much knowledge as possible about what your child is going through script, a role-play so that they feel more prepared for various social situations. If they have all the information about a certain event, i.e., who is attending, what they are expecting to do, etc. your child may be calmer in participating than isolating themselves. If they do not have all the information, they will avoid engagement.\n\nConnect with your child. Consider the PACE approach (playfulness, acceptance, curiosity and empathy) model. PACE is a wonderful way to engage with your child and help them feel safe as they navigate their anxiety. When you as an adult model that you are calm and relaxed in social situations, they will also slow down. Showing playfulness towards a situation will immediately take the serious worry out of it. Showing acceptance of your child\u2019s feelings teaches them that they can come to you with their anxiety and feel heard and safe because you listen.\n\nShowing interest and curiosity in their day-to-day activities will help your child take steps to start something new at their own pace. Showing empathy towards the anxieties they are facing helps them to feel connected to you and shows them that you understand how they are feeling. Once they are interacting with you in a space that feels both safe and empathetic, you can start to work on techniques to alleviate the social anxiety that your child is feeling.\n\nFind balance. Learn when to step in as a parent and when to walk away so that your child may overcome the situation they are in. By no means is this easy, but when you hover over your anxious child, it can make them feel more anxious or helpless in your absence. Allow them to find their own voice in the emotion they are experiencing. We can teach our children about emotion regulation to help them work through bigger social interactions. When they find the calm within their own anxious storm, it will reduce stress and assist them through life.\n\nTeach your child relaxation strategies. Children need a variety of tools when they feel anxious and overwhelmed. Navigating childhood challenges can be stressful, and sometimes deep breathing is not the only solution that could work for your child. Consider other relaxation strategies such as visualising a quiet place, drinking some water, singing out loud, exercises like jump-rope, swimming or even cycling and running. Another approach to help is the stepladder approach. This is a gentle behaviour technique that you can use to help your children physically and visually experience starting small things before tackling the big and scary things.\n\nFocus on progress, not perfection. Fear of failure, fear of looking bad in front of friends and family or even the fear of not meeting a goal can weigh heavily on a child\u2019s feelings that is experiencing social anxiety. So, help them focus on the progress they have made instead of the perfection, e.g., help your child to speak about the love of the game. How much they enjoy practising and engaging with their peers rather than the win or lose. Learning a growth mindset is how they will learn to thrive amid the anxiety.\n\nAllow your child to worry. As your children get older they face more complex social challenges. Starting school. Meeting new friends. Learning to swim. Competing in sports. Learning to drive. Moving away for university. Each new thing can feel like a big step forward. Worry is a natural part of life. It can be helpful as long as it does not take over their lives. Thinking through the part they worry about, calmly and with support, can help your children get ready for what is ahead by anticipating what to expect. When children feel prepared, they can focus on the part they are looking forward to.\n\nSeek help. If your child has excessive worry, is easily triggered by mildly stressful situations, or gets panic attacks, talk with your child's doctor or a specialist on mental wellbeing. Childhood anxiety can get better with the right treatment and support.", "articleBodyHtml": "<article>\n\n<p>By  For Citizen Digital</p>\n\n<figure><img title=\"Tips to combat feelings of social anxiety in children\" alt=\"Tips to combat feelings of social anxiety in children\" src=\"https://images.citizen.digital/7250/conversions/file-image-thumbnail.jpg\" data-v-765062a4=\"\"></figure>\n\n<ul><li>Whether you were socially anxious before the pandemic or developed social anxiety as a result of being isolated, the prospect of returning to a day-to-day \u2018new-normal\u2019 life can feel daunting to even the strongest person.<br></li><li>Children and teenagers with social anxiety have an excessive fear of social performance situations.

At the risk of starting a war with Aaron Rimbui and Bien Baraza\u2019s 'Bald Man' army, here is what you need to know about growing and keeping that afro in good condition:\n\nGrowing\n\nAfrican hair grows at an average of 1cm per month, but because of its curl pattern, it is likely for someone to think nothing is going on. After the 8-month mark, depending on how curly your hair is or whether you started from a buzz-cut or a tapered fade, your hair begins to get out of the \u2018awkward stage\u2019 everyone hates and can be picked into a shapely small halo.\n\nHowever, the major perk of being in the \u2018awkward stage\u2019 is how seamless it is to take care of. Many guys can be obsessed with attaining more length that they fail to enjoy this stage. Less tangling and as such detangling is just a couple of picks and you are done. Your products last longer because you are not using a lot. Quicker wash sessions. And the most overlooked benefit: you can wear hats.\n\nProducts\n\nFor starters, the much available information on African hair products can seem overwhelming and unattainable. However, know that you mainly need a good shampoo (free of sulfates and parabens, which strip our naturally-dry hair even more drier), a deep conditioner to restore moisture in your hair after you have shampooed it, and a moisturizer or oil for frequent moisture restoration. You can build on your product collection from there depending on specific needs of your hair.\n\nWashing\n\nIn this case, \u2018washing\u2019 refers to shampooing, anything else is just hydrating your hair with water. It is highly recommended that you do not wash your hair too frequently as it will strip your hair dry and brittle, and your scalp will not retain the natural oils it produces. An average of once a week is enough shampooing for most people. Additionally, a micro-fiber towel or a cotton t-shirt is recommended to dry your hair after washing, as regular towels tend to rip your hair off.\n\nTools\n\nBecause of the tight curls of Afro-textured hair, combs with spaced out teeth are the best to use. Depending on how your hair responds to it, you will know whether the combs you are comfortable with are fine-toothed or wide-toothed. Although wide-toothed combs are considered ideal, some tightly curled hair types co-operate with fine-toothed combs, provided the teeth are spaced out.\n\nWhile at it, be careful of parts of your head where hair is delicate, such as the temples. For most men who keep their hair free or in dreadlocks, the hair around the temple struggles with growing full and they decide to get a taper fade altogether.

At the risk of starting a war with Aaron\nRimbui and Bien Baraza\u2019s 'Bald Man'\u00a0army, here is what you need to know about growing and\nkeeping that afro in good condition:<br></p>\n\n<p><strong>Growing</strong></p>\n\n<p>African hair grows at an average of 1cm per\nmonth, but because of its curl pattern, it is likely for someone to think\nnothing is going on. After the 8-month mark, depending on how curly your hair\nis or whether you started from a buzz-cut or a tapered fade, your hair begins\nto get out of the \u2018awkward stage\u2019 everyone hates and can be picked into a\nshapely small halo.</p>\n\n<p>However, the major perk of being in the \u2018awkward\nstage\u2019 is how seamless it is to take care of. Many guys can be obsessed with\nattaining more length that they fail to enjoy this stage. Less tangling and as\nsuch detangling is just a couple of picks and you are done. Your products last\nlonger because you are not using a lot. Quicker wash sessions. And the most\noverlooked benefit: you can wear hats.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Products</strong></p>\n\n<p>For starters, the much available information\non African hair products can seem overwhelming and unattainable. However, know\nthat you mainly need a good shampoo (free of sulfates and parabens, which strip\nour naturally-dry hair even more drier), a deep conditioner to restore moisture in your hair after you have shampooed it, and a moisturizer or oil for\nfrequent moisture restoration. You can build on your product collection from\nthere depending on specific needs of your hair.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Washing</strong></p>\n\n<p>In this case, \u2018washing\u2019 refers to shampooing,\nanything else is just hydrating your hair with water. It is highly recommended\nthat you do not wash your hair too frequently as it will strip your hair dry\nand brittle, and your scalp will not retain the natural oils it produces. An average of once a week is enough shampooing for most people. Additionally, a micro-fiber towel or a cotton t-shirt is recommended to dry your hair after\nwashing, as regular towels tend to rip your hair off.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Tools</strong></p>\n\n<p>Because of the tight curls of Afro-textured\nhair, combs with spaced out teeth are the best to use. Depending on how your\nhair responds to it, you will know whether the combs you are comfortable with\nare fine-toothed or wide-toothed. Although wide-toothed combs are considered ideal,\nsome tightly curled hair types co-operate with fine-toothed combs, provided the\nteeth are spaced out.</p>\n\n<p>While at it, be careful of parts of your head\nwhere hair is delicate, such as the temples. For most men who keep their hair\nfree or in dreadlocks, the hair around the temple struggles with growing full\nand they decide to get a taper fade altogether. But if you want a full afro,\nyou cannot afford to do that. Minimize manipulation on the delicate parts and\nmanipulate gently when you need to.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Sleeping</strong></p>\n\n<p>Because African hair tends to be dry and\nloses moisture easily, covering it while you sleep is very essential so that\nyou do not lose all the moisture you have spent time infusing into it down your\npillow. Most pillowcases are made of cotton and cotton saps all the moisture,\nmaking your hair prone to severe tangling and breakage. As such, it is\nadvisable to use a silk pillowcase or cover your head with a silk durag or wave\ncap. As your hair gets longer, you might need to part it and do a few\nchunky twists or tie it up to prevent matting overnight.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Diet</strong></p>\n\n<p>Vitamins B are regarded as the best for hair\ngrowth, so add a bias to such foods as milk, eggs, meat and vegetables such as\nspinach and kale. Drinking plenty of water is advised, too.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Hair loss</strong></p>\n\n<p>It is normal to shed hair daily but excessive\nloss through either breakage or shedding can be detrimental to your progress.\nKeep hair loss minimal at all costs; only comb your hair when it is properly\nmoisturized, and the biggest source of hair moisture is water.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Join communities</strong></p>\n\n<p>Joining forums of people with African hair\nwho are on hair growth journeys tends to help a lot in exchanging notes and\ntips.

The National Council of Churches of Kenya (NCCK) has a week-long conference where the clergy is deliberating on matters relating to next year\u2019s general election.\n\nOn Wednesday, NCCK hosted and prayed for IEBC Chairman Wafula Chebukati and his team of commissioners. And that is commendable. We all need prayers, especially before embarking on major assignments, just like the commission has a key national task in the next 243 days. But it will take more than prayers for the electoral commission. Chebukati and his team must conduct the August 9 general election in as much a free, fair, credible and verifiable way as possible.\n\nThe ghosts of August 2017 are memorable. That the Supreme Court, led by Chief Justice Emeritus David Maraga, nullified the presidential election results and ordered a repeat poll was a confirmation that the exercise was marred by irregularities. The commission was found culpable of errors of omission and commission. Fixing those anomalies and avoiding a repeat will require more than prayers. Transparency in procurement of electoral materials, recruitment of election officials, counting and declaration of results, as well as their transmission to the national tallying centre will require professionalism and dedication. Anything short of that will be a waste of the prayers conducted at the Jumuiya conference centre.\n\nHopefully, NCCK, in that mood of prayers, will consider inviting presidential contenders for a divine appointment. The clergymen and women should pray for the presidential hopefuls to have the spirit of accepting the choices that the Kenyan electorate will make at the ballot. NCCK should pray for the State House contenders to realise and understand that only one of them can succeed President Uhuru Kenyatta next year. NCCK should pray for the presidential candidates to accept that in any race, there will be a winner and a loser. Those prayers should be geared towards seeking divine intervention for whoever loses to accept the poll outcome, in the spirit of fair competition. And for whoever wins, NCCK should pray for him or her to be magnanimous in victory, and to govern with fairness and justice.\n\nNCCK should also pray that the 2017 handshake be the last one. That the election process will be so transparent that it will leave no room for a dispute. That once the presidential race is concluded, and a winner declared, that there will be no violence. It should no longer be a normal or fashionable thing to use violence as a tool of political negotiation. Sadly, there are tell-tale signs of a likely hotly contested State House race, that could go either way, and a possibility of rejection of results. But it is still too early. Hopefully, within the remaining 8 months, IEBC can do its job in a manner that inspires confidence of those who will succeed and those who won't clinch the seats they are eyeing.\n\nThe NCCK prayer chain should also be extended to the electorate. The voter register currently has 21.1 million Kenyans. We should all be prayed for, so that we make the right and wise choices at the ballot. That those choices should be guided by our heads, and not stomachs. NCCK should pray fervently for the Kenyan electorate to realise that voting for a candidate merely because he or she comes from your tribe or clan and not their capacity to govern, is a 5-year loss. The prayers should also be geared towards making Kenyans realise that voting for a person who gave you Ksh.200 or a kilo of sugar or a leso is akin to selling your birthright for a bowl of pumpkin soup like esau in the Bible story of Genesis Chapter 25, verses 29 to 34.\n\nMore importantly, let NCCK and all religious leaders lead the nation in praying for peace and harmonious co-existence, political differences and persuasions notwithstanding, before, during and after the general election, since Kenya returned to multi-partysm.", "articleBodyHtml": "<article>\n\n<p>The countdown to the August 9,\u00a02022\nGeneral Election is on.

It is inadequate, it's costly and if we're paying taxes, we shouldn't have to be paying for these costs privately - we should be getting adequate public healthcare! The only way for this to happen is if we spend on it. Private entities cannot out invest government and thus the best services both in infrastructure and in manpower should be found in the public sector.

Even as we call for increased spending on public healthcare, we must also insist on accountability for those funds. As we allocate the funds on the more financially and corruptly rewarding brick and mortar like Isolation units, ICU beds, and more drugs, we must also ensure that we invest in the less exciting aspect of human resources for health. Corruption in the procurement process of these must be punished severely because it undermines any efforts we make on healthcare.\n\nWe must also upscale our local manufacturing ofhealthcare commodities. When the pandemic struck our main pharmaceutical supply chains in India and China were cut off as countries withheld the products for their own use. This created a shortage of essential products like Personal Protective Equipment and led to unnecessary infection and deaths of health workers.\n\nThe need to practice data driven interventions in healthcare. This can only be possible if we strengthen our healthcare reporting mechanisms all the way from the household level upwards. Many a times decisions were made blindly and this only worsened the situation especially on the restriction of movements and burial rites.\n\nFinally, we must treat healthcare workers as the heroes that they truly are. World over the frontliners put aside personal fears, to not only serve patients but do so selflessly knowing that with the shortage of personal protective gears they were not just endangering their lives but also of their loved ones. While most governments appreciated these sacrifices and rewarded them accordingly, the same cannot be said of Kenya. Kenyans were treated to constant threats by the workers to down their tools due to inadequate and poor quality of PPEs, delayed salaries, lack of health insurance cover and poor work environment.\n\nWhen Dr. Stephen Mogusu,a young Kenyan Medical Officer who worked in a COVID isolation center succumbed to the same in February this year, he was just 28years old and he had not been paid for five months and did not have a medical insurance cover and could not afford the very services he had offered to hundreds of patients from Machakos county. He left behind a young wife and an infant child. Sadly this was not an isolated but rather the norm in the many Isolation centers in the country.\n\nThe 100 day doctors strike in 2017 was one of the longest and most devastating workers strikes in Kenyan history alongside the nurses 150 day strike.

Over the last few days the attention of the country has been focused on the one hand, on the Mwingi tragedy in which at least 33 people lost their lives after a bus that was ferrying them to a wedding plunged into a local river known as Enziu. Across on the other side of the country, eight miners were trapped in a place called Abimbo in the county of Siaya, when the walls of their mine caved in, burying them underneath.\n\nBut it is the response or lack thereof in Abimbo that I wish to focus on. You see, immediately after the mime collapsed on December 2, local residents and fellow workers swung into action as they say, using every crude tool they could lay their hands on. They saved two miners shortly after. Five others have since been rescued, one other has sadly lost his life, while one is still unaccounted for. But what has stood out the most is the painstaking wait for any form of meaningful help from any of the two levels of government.\n\nThe rescue mission, which continues to date, has been hampered by a basic lack of specialised equipment to sort through the rubble and get to the remaining miner who is yet to be accounted for. Of course one has to raise real questions about the disaster preparedness of the county government of Siaya if such a relatively minor accident can remain unresolved a whole one week later. But even then, shouldn't this have been taken up by the national government, the military perhaps? Does anyone remember how the government deployed in full force in Likoni two years ago, when a 35-year-old mother and her four-year-old daughter plunged into the sea after their car slipped from a ferry ramp. In fact so intense was the rescue effort that divers were brought in from as far as South Africa to boost local efforts.\n\nBut not in Abimbo. Seven days and counting, the relatives of the last miner who is yet to be saved, continue to camp at the site, asking for more advanced equipment. The Siaya County government eventually sent in an excavator but it was too little to late and the rescue efforts that have so far saved six lives, have largely been mounted by the local residents using hoes and spades to rescue their fellow miners.\n\nThe response seems to have been way better in the case of the Mwingi bus accident, which granted, was horrific, causing the deaths of 33. There we saw national and county governments rush to the site and promise change. But why, I ask, haven't we seen the same in Abimbo? Undoubtedly, the two incidents may not be identical but a life is a life and one life is just as important as 33 lives. You see, just like in Mwingi, the one death so far in Abimbo was needless because the government appears to have abdicated its role in some of these seemingly far-flung corners of the country. But the glaring difference in response between Mwingi and Abimbo, would make one wonder whether the people of Abimbo are children of a lesser god.\n\nIn Mwingi, we saw a PS, a CS, a county governor, and other leaders from Ukambani flock to site. How many of those did we see in Abimbo? So whilst we are celebrating the miracle of the six miners being alive for up to six days, it is all thanks to the local residents who devised ways to keep them alive by connecting a pipe down to the collapsed mine to provide air to those trapped.\n\nAway from the slow response, the Abimbo scandal, because that is what it is now, also raises real questions about the safety of such mines that are now popping up in many villages around Nyanza and Western regions. In May this year, five miners died in a similar tragedy in Bushiangala in Kakamega County. Another five artisanal miners died in the same area. We cannot blame the local residents for continuing to go to the mines that are unsafe, but rather the governments, both national and county, who are supposed to ensure mines are safe before being allowed to start operations.\n\nSo our hearts must go to the people of Abimbo as they hold onto razor-thin hope that the one last miner who is yet to be pulled out will make it.
