named Tesla and SpaceX CEO Elon Musk as its Person of the Year, for an incredible 12 months of achievements in which he jockeyed for the crown of world\u2019s richest person and made his Twitter account a must-read while moving the needle on climate change, cryptocurrencies, space exploration, and universal broadband.\n\nIn April, NASA granted Musk\u2019s rocket company SpaceX an exclusive contract to put United States astronauts on the moon for the first time since 1972 \u2013 moving Musk one step ahead of rival old-guard rocket firm Boeing and one step closer to his stated goal of helping to make humans a multi-planetary species.\n\nIn May, Musk hosted Saturday Night Live, using the television show as a platform to poke fun at himself and to raise awareness of Asperger syndrome, a mild form of autism, by announcing that he has it.\n\nIn October, Musk\u2019s growing wealth received yet another turbo-charged after car-rental company Hertz said it planned to buy 100,000 Teslas for its customers. The news sent Tesla stock soaring and the electric vehicle company\u2019s valuation past $1 trillion.\n\nThough electric vehicles comprised just 0.43 percent of all vehicles in operation in the US in the first half of this year, Tesla commanded roughly two-thirds of that market, according to Experian Automotive.\n\nAll those milestones did not quell Musk\u2019s quirky (and sometimes costly) behaviour. He regularly shares humorous memes with his 65 million followers on Twitter. Last month, Tesla shares took a knock after Musk asked in a Twitter poll whether he should sell his Tesla stock, which he has to the sum of nearly $11bn dollars, according to the US Securities and Exchange Commission.\n\nHe\u2019s also used Twitter as a platform to help move cryptocurrencies more into the mainstream. In February, Musk announced that Tesla had bought $1.5bn in Bitcoin and signalled its intent to start accepting it as payment. He also extolled Dogecoin through a series of memes that helped transform the once-joke cryptocurrency into a sought-after digital asset.\n\nBut he also showed the limits of his crypto boosterism, tweeting in May that Tesla would suspend accepting payments in Bitcoin and citing concerns over the cryptocurrency\u2019s carbon footprint.\n\nNot just dollars and memes\n\nThe about-face on Bitcoin lent more credibility to Musk\u2019s loftier stated aims to curb climate change.\n\n\u201cHad the 800,000 Teslas sold in the last year been gas-powered cars, they would have emitted more than 40 million metric tons of CO\u2082 over their lifetimes\u2014equivalent to the annual emissions of Finland,\u201d Time magazine wrote in its profile of Musk.\n\nBut curbing emissions is just a part of his grand vision for humanity. Musk also wants people to start colonising Mars.\n\n\u201cThe goal overall has been to make life multi-planetary and enable humanity to become a spacefaring civilization,\u201d Musk told Time.\n\nWhen asked by Time about the timeline for sending people to Mars and refueling on the Red Planet to come back to Earth, Musk responded: \u201cI\u2019ll be surprised if we\u2019re not landing on Mars within five years.\u201d\n\nBack here on Earth, Musk is working to close the digital divide with Starlink, a satellite broadband service with nearly 2,000 launched satellites to date. He hopes to launch as many as 42,000 more to provide internet service to underserved developing and rural communities around the globe.\n\nMusk is also in talks with Brazil\u2019s government on how Starlink\u2019s satellites can help combat the Amazon\u2019s deforestation and forest fires.

Earlier this year, a federal jury ordered Tesla to fork over $137m to an African American former employee at the EV maker\u2019s factory in Freemont, California, who said that Tesla turned a blind eye to racial abuse.\n\nTesla has been fined for regulatory violations. And the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration is looking into the safety of Tesla\u2019s Autopilot software after a complaint implicated it in a crash.\n\nMusk\u2019s Midas touch and expanding net worth have also landed him in the inequality crosshairs and the debate over whether the government should force the rich to pay more taxes.\n\n\u201cA lot of the push for higher government involvement and expropriating of assets by the government is pushed by a bunch of politicians who are actually saying that resources in the control of private individuals should be in control of the government. They are basically saying that they want control of the assets,\u201d Musk told Time magazine in an interview.\n\nBorn in Pretoria, South Africa, Musk moved to the US to attend Stanford University as a Ph.D. candidate but dropped out.

Often, the reason why some organizations are unable to balance the two rests in their inability to embrace technology, in a manner capable of addressing business needs today. \u201c Chatbots \u201d the fast revolution in technology today cannot be underestimated, as statistics from Spiceworks state that 62% of businesses in the world today are adapting to new technologies.\n\nWhat is a Chatbot?\n\nIn simple terms, a chatbot is computer software that simulates human conversation through voice commands or text chats, or both. There are a number of Chatbots that we mainly interact with on daily basis. A good example is a floating icon on the bottom right or right-hand side of your screen when you visit a website. Another example is Zuri from Safaricom and Sheila from Brainverse.\n\nImportance of a Chatbot\n\nThe primary goal of any marketing strategy is always to attract the consumers towards a given product, so as to escalate the sales volume of that product. A Chatbot has mainly shortened your life span as a company to reach your desired goals.\n\nBelow is the significance of a Chatbot\n\n1. Cost saving\n\nLet\u2019s do the maths together. Imagine having to travel to and from the city center in Nairobi, just to consult on a fault on a product that you purchased. Ultimately, you have incurred transportation costs you had not planned for. What if you had an online link and you could use it to interact with your dealer in a blink of an eye? Chatbots are mainly built-in line with Artificial Intelligence and humanized which allows you to interact with your dealer via text conversations.\n\n2. Interacts with multiple users\n\nUnlike humans, chatbots are programmed to mainly interact with the client, and with this capability, a chatbot can multitask. This allows you to reach more clients at a time. Another significance is the user, who can also interact with different Chatbots at a time. Very few studies have explored the influence of such promotional tools I.e., Chatbots are flyers to your client\u2019s decision to purchase your services.\n\n3. Available 24/7\n\nAs competition is very stiff, any business willing to succeed in this turbulent environment should seek to be available 24/7. Remember in any organization, strategy is critical to the success of the organization. Implement a chatbot for your business today by visiting Brainverse Technologies\u2019 home page. Let us help you go online.\n\nTechnicality\n\nThe significance of a Chatbot in a business is justified. In computational view, a chatbot is an Artificial Intelligence software programmed in three critical stages ranging from the conceptual view, analyzing, and construction of the Chatbot.\n\nThe main significance of Artificial Intelligence is that it allows you to interact in your native languages I.e., Sheng by Sheila and Swahili by Zuri. The best part is that experts have a way of programming Bots within given parameters of queries. Thus, answering any question posed to them.\n\nMain functions of Chatbot\n\n1.

Often, the reason why some organizations are unable to balance the two rests in their inability to embrace technology, in a manner capable of addressing business needs today. \u201c<a href=\"https://www.brainverse.co/services/business-chatbot/\">Chatbots</a>\u201d the fast revolution in technology today cannot be underestimated, as statistics from Spiceworks state that 62% of businesses in the world today are adapting to new technologies.</p>\n\n<h2>What is a Chatbot?</h2>\n\n<p>In simple terms, a chatbot is computer software that simulates human conversation through voice commands or text chats, or both. There are a number of Chatbots that we mainly interact with on daily basis. A good example is a floating icon on the bottom right or right-hand side of your screen when you visit a website. Another example is Zuri from Safaricom and <a href=\"https://www.brainverse.co/services/business-chatbot/\">Sheila from Brainverse</a>.</p>\n\n<h2>Importance of a Chatbot</h2>\n\n<p>The primary goal of any marketing strategy is always to attract the consumers towards a given product, so as to escalate the sales volume of that product. A Chatbot has mainly shortened your life span as a company to reach your desired goals.</p>\n\n<h2>Below is the significance of a Chatbot</h2>\n\n<h3>1. Cost saving</h3>\n\n<p>Let\u2019s do the maths together. Imagine having to travel to and from the city center in Nairobi, just to consult on a fault on a product that you purchased. Ultimately, you have incurred transportation costs you had not planned for. What if you had an online link and you could use it to interact with your dealer in a blink of an eye? Chatbots are mainly built-in line with Artificial Intelligence and humanized which allows you to interact with your dealer via text conversations.</p>\n\n<h3>2. Interacts with multiple users</h3>\n\n<p>Unlike humans, chatbots are programmed to mainly interact with the client, and with this capability, a <a href=\"https://www.brainverse.co/services/business-chatbot/\">chatbot</a> can multitask. This allows you to reach more clients at a time. Another significance is the user, who can also interact with different Chatbots at a time. Very few studies have explored the influence of such promotional tools I.e., Chatbots are flyers to your client\u2019s decision to purchase your services.</p>\n\n<h3>3. Available 24/7</h3>\n\n<p>As competition is very stiff, any business willing to succeed in this turbulent environment should seek to be available 24/7. Remember in any organization, strategy is critical to the success of the organization. Implement a chatbot for your business today by visiting Brainverse Technologies\u2019 home page. Let us help you go online.</p>\n\n<h2>Technicality</h2>\n\n<p>The significance of a Chatbot in a business is justified. In computational view, a chatbot is an Artificial Intelligence software programmed in three critical stages ranging from the conceptual view,  analyzing, and construction of the Chatbot.</p>\n\n<p>The main significance of Artificial Intelligence is that it allows you to interact in your native languages I.e., <a href=\"https://webchat.snatchbot.me/54447cf01e1faf8c41434d780c4dca47bc42a94d937172240698147db7cb29a5\">Sheng by Sheila</a> and Swahili by Zuri. The best part is that experts have a way of programming Bots within given parameters of queries. Thus, answering any question posed to them.</p>\n\n<h2>Main functions of Chatbot</h2>\n\n<p>1. Gives feedback to the service provider.</p>\n\n<p>2. Acts as a customer\u2019s help desk.</p>\n\n<p>3. Offers the client\u2019s view of different products offered.</p>\n\n<p>4. Creates intimacy between the client and the service provider.</p>\n\n<p>5. Gives you a competitive advantage, as marketing is done for you on online platforms.</p>\n\n<p>Conclusively, it is of great importance to understand how a chatbot plays a critical role in the success of a company.

Just this past August Britain opened a formal investigation into suspicions of corruption at British American Tobacco (BAT) (BATS.L) and its subsidiaries, nearly two years after allegations of bribery in Africa first surfaced.\n\u201cThe SFO confirms it is investigating suspicions of corruption in the conduct of business by BAT plc, its subsidiaries, and associated persons,\u201d Britain\u2019s Serious Fraud Office (SFO) said in a statement.\nThe maker of brands including Dunhill and Lucky Strike said in February last year it had appointed a law firm to investigate allegations of historic misconduct in Africa and that it was liaising with the SFO. The 2016 move came after a November 2015 BBC program described cases of BAT employees bribing officials in East African countries including Rwanda and Burundi in an effort to undermine anti-smoking laws.
