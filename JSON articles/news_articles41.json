In this article we focus on the mortgage option.\n\nTo begin with, a mortgage is a debt facility extended by a financial institution-mortgage lender or bank, to enable an individual purchase a home or property.\n\nWhile it\u2019s possible to take out loans to cover the entire cost of a home, it\u2019s more common to secure a loan for about 90% of the home\u2019s value.\n\nWhen choosing a mortgage, borrowers mainly just focus on the interest rate and fees you\u2019ll be charged.\n\nHowever, there is also need to consider the types of mortgage loan options available when making a decision on the same. The two most common types of mortgages are fixed-rate and adjustable-rate (also known as variable rate) mortgages.\n\nFixed-rate mortgages provide borrowers with an established interest rate over a set term of typically 10, 15, or 20 years (\u201cinitial period\u201d of the loan). With a fixed interest rate, the shorter the term over which the borrower pays, the higher the monthly payment. Conversely, the longer the borrower takes to pay, the smaller the monthly repayment amount. However, the longer it takes to repay the loan, the more the borrower ultimately pays in interest charges.\n\nThe greatest advantage of a fixed-rate mortgage is that first, the borrower can count on their monthly mortgage payments being the same every month throughout the life of their mortgage, making it easier to set household budgets and avoid any unexpected additional charges from one month to the next.\n\nSecondly, the borrower can lock in lower rates if market interest rates increase significantly, thus the borrower doesn\u2019t have to make higher monthly payments. In addition, lenders often compete with fixed rate specials.\n\nOn the downside, fixed rates often have limits on how much you can raise repayments or make extra payments without paying charges. More so, if you take a long term, there is a risk floating rates may drop below your fixed rate but you cannot benefit from the drop. And finally, if you choose to sell your property and/or break a fixed loan you may be charged a \u2018break fee\u2019.\n\nFixed-rate loans are ideal for buyers who plan to stay put for many years. A 20-year fixed loan might give you wiggle room to meet other financial needs.\n\nHowever, if you have the appetite for a little risk and the resources and discipline to pay your mortgage off faster, a 10-year fixed loan can save you considerably on interest and cut your repayment period in half. In spite of that, it is important to note that, within the Kenyan mortgage market, the maximum loan maturity period reported by the Central Bank of Kenya was 20 years, with the average period of time offered by most lenders being 11.3 years as at 2019.\n\nOn the other hand, we have variable rate mortgages also referred to as adjustable rate mortgages. With this type of mortgage, interest rates usually change over the life of the loan.\n\nIn some cases, adjustable-rate mortgages mostly have a fixed rate for an initial period, but after that period expires the rate fluctuates.\n\nIncreases in market rates and other factors cause interest rates to fluctuate, which changes the amount of interest the borrower must pay, and, therefore, changes the total monthly payment due.\n\nWith adjustable rate mortgages, the interest rate is set to be reviewed and adjusted at specific times. For example, the rate may be adjusted once a year or once every six months depending on the mortgage lender.\n\nSome adjustable rate mortgages products have a rate cap specifying that your monthly mortgage payment cannot exceed a certain amount. In that case, it is important for a borrower to crunch the numbers to ensure that they can potentially handle any payment increases up to that point.\n\nIt is advisable that one does not count on being able to sell their home or refinance their mortgage before their mortgage resets because market conditions and ones finances could change.\n\nOn the upside, with the variable rate mortgage, the borrower has more flexibility to make changes without penalty, such as paying off the loan early or changing the loan term.\n\nOften, the borrower will also enjoy a lower fixed rate in the first few years of homeownership as the rates tend to be lower. Additionally, it\u2019s easier to consolidate other, more expensive debt into floating rate loans by borrowing more.\n\nThe primary risk with this type of mortgages is that interest rates may increase significantly over the life of the loan, to a point where the mortgage payments become so high that they are difficult for the borrower to meet. Significant rate increases may even lead to default and the borrower losing the home through foreclosure.\n\nAdjustable rate mortgages are a solid option if the borrower intends to refinance before the loan resets, as the interest rates for these mortgages tend to be lower than fixed rates in the early years of repayment, so one could potentially save significantly on interest payments in the initial years of homeownership.\n\nIn conclusion, choosing the mortgage loan that\u2019s best for a borrower\u2019s situation relies primarily on their financial health: income, credit history and score, employment, and financial goals.\n\nMortgage lenders can help analyze ones finances to help determine the best mortgage loan products, and understand the qualification requirements, which can be complex.\n\nIt is therefore important to undertake an in-depth comparison of the available deals focusing on all aspects of the loans; the type, minimum requirements, applicable interest rates, relevant fees, flexibility of payments and exit penalties.", "articleBodyHtml": "<article>\n\n<p>Owning a home is one of the major milestones an individual can achieve.
