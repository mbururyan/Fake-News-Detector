gubernatorial candidate in Migori County ahead of the next year\u2019s general elections.\n\nThe community is divided on the preferred candidate among the four candidates coming from the community.\n\nThe candidates include Migori Woman representative Dr. Pamela Odhiambo, Migori County Secretary Mr. Christopher Rusana, Former Migori MP John Pesa and Businessman Philip Ogwari Mwabe.\n\nEarly this year, the community led by the Chair Suba Council of Elders Riogi Riogi put up a committee mandated to identify a single candidate who will face candidates from other regions, deliberations that resulted the endorsement of Rusana as the candidate, following the alleged voting done in a Kisii hotel, a result which was disputed by other candidates, saying that they are all going to the ballot.\n\nMonths later, Suba Council of elders Riogi Riogi led other elders to Mabera for the endorsement of the Migori Woman representative Dr. Pamela Odhiambo by Suba-Kuria elders as the choice for the Governor\u2019s seat in 2022 general elections, despite having endorsed Rusana for the same seat.\n\nFormer Migori MP John Pesa termed the endorsements as inconsequential and that it\u2019s a mandate of the electorates to decide on their next Governor and therefore he will seek endorsements from the electorates, bringing other members of the community on his side.\n\nBusinessman Philip Mwabe said that the alleged endorsements do not reflect the true will of the people, promising to go all the way to the ballot and face other candidates.\n\nHowever, Migori County Secretary Christopher Rusana, feels that the disunity among the community on the choice for Governor might cost them in the 2022 general elections and might give a chance to other gubernatorial candidates from other region in Migori County a chance to win the race, calling the community to rally their support behind him, having been endorsed by them.\n\nMigori County has eight constituencies which are Rongo, Awendo, Uriri, Suna east, Suna west, Nyatike, Kuria east and Kuria west.\n\nRongo has one candidate who is Former Rongo MP Dalmas Otieno, Awendo has the Migori County Senator Dr.

on the choice of gubernatorial candidate in Migori County ahead of the next year\u2019s general elections.</p>\n\n<p>The community is divided on the preferred candidate among the four candidates coming from the community.</p>\n\n<p>The candidates include Migori Woman representative Dr. Pamela Odhiambo, Migori County Secretary Mr. Christopher Rusana, Former Migori MP John Pesa and Businessman Philip Ogwari Mwabe.</p>\n\n<p>Early this year, the community led by the Chair Suba Council of Elders Riogi Riogi put up a committee mandated to identify a single candidate who will face candidates from other regions, deliberations that resulted the endorsement of Rusana as the candidate, following the alleged voting done in a Kisii hotel, a result which was disputed by other candidates, saying that they are all going to the ballot.</p>\n\n<p>Months later, Suba Council of elders Riogi Riogi led other elders to Mabera for the endorsement of the Migori Woman representative Dr. Pamela Odhiambo by Suba-Kuria elders as the choice for the Governor\u2019s seat in 2022 general elections, despite having endorsed Rusana for the same seat.</p>\n\n<p>Former Migori MP John Pesa termed the endorsements as inconsequential and that it\u2019s a mandate of the electorates to decide on their next Governor and therefore he will seek endorsements from the electorates, bringing other members of the community on his side.</p>\n\n<p>Businessman Philip Mwabe said that the alleged endorsements do not reflect the true will of the people, promising to go all the way to the ballot and face other candidates.</p>\n\n<p>However, Migori County Secretary Christopher Rusana, feels that the disunity among the community on the choice for Governor might cost them in the 2022 general elections and might give a chance to other gubernatorial candidates from other region in Migori County a chance to win the race, calling the community to rally their support behind him, having been endorsed by them.</p>\n\n<p>Migori County has eight constituencies which are Rongo, Awendo, Uriri, Suna east, Suna west, Nyatike, Kuria east and Kuria west.</p>\n\n<p>Rongo has one candidate who is Former Rongo MP Dalmas Otieno, Awendo has the Migori County Senator Dr. Ochilo Ayacko, Kuria west has Migori County CEC Water Rebecca Maroa, Nyatike has Migori speaker Boaz Okoth as other constituencies have not

He feeds the fish daily at 10am and 5pm, a venture\n\n\u201cI started with a standard pond measuring ten-by-ten feet in 2013 along river Oyani on a three-quarter of an acre family land along river Oyani in Migori county, but sadly it was swept away by floods,\u201d he said.\n\nHe lost all 800 tilapia fingerlings which made him suffer 100 per cent loss on Sh45,000 he had invested in labour, feeds and construction of the pond.\n\nShortly afterwards he joined Double Edge Environment Change Group of youths from Oyani area to supply eucalyptus, pine and bamboo tree seedling to the Migori county government for environment upgrade project which saw him earn Sh600,000.\n\nWith the money he fortified his fish pond and built two others ponds measuring 30-by-50 feet and 20-by-30 feet which he stocked with 1,200 and 1,000 tilapia fingerlings respectively and added 200 catfish.\n\n\u201cFish is harvested twice a year, after every six months. I feed them fish starter for two months before I move to growers mash until they are ready for market,\u201d he said.\n\nA pond can get him Sh63,000 for catfish and Sh240,000 for tilapia which he always sells for hotels and institutions which is in addition to local ready market some who come to his farm.\n\nHow to build a pond and maximise profit\n\n\u201cThere are two types of fish ponds, first one is built using a dam liner or concrete on any type of soil and a second one which is fed by underground or river water in swampy area. I work on the second part because my parcel of land is swampy,\u201d Shikuku said.\n\nTo build a pond, a farmer should first sample the soil type and topography of the land to ascertain surface runoff which can silt ponds and risks of flooding for stock to be swept away.\n\n\u201cA standard pond measures ten-by-ten feet and while digging the deeper end should be about 4.5 feet lower which is often the lower side of a slope, and the shallow end on the other side is 3.5 feet,\u201d Shikuku explains.\n\nAfter digging the pond, fill it with water three weeks to stocking then add agricultural lime to kill insects and other pests in the water.\n\n\u201cIn a standard pond (10-by-10 feet) you add a half a kilo of normal commercial fertilizer to help in building planktons and algae which are fish feed. By the end of three weeks the water will turn greenish ready for stocking,\u201d he explained.\n\nFingerlings always come in tight polythene bags and a farmer is advised to sink it in water first before opening it.\n\n\u201cIf your fingerlings are mono sex, all are either male or female, then feed them after three days.

PRAISE HIS P*NIS AND MASTER HIS BODY</p>\n\n<p>A man is most vulnerable when he lets you have his p*nis. When you make him feel good about it, he will s3xually approach you with confidence. It is an ego thing</p>\n\n<p>3. BUILD FRIENDSHIP AND NON-S3XUAL INTIMACY</p>\n\n<p>Love making is easier, sweeter and more intense when you two have a strong emotional connection. Don\u2019t be strangers who only come together for s3x</p>\n\n<p>4.

CHECK IF HE HAS A HISTORY OF MASTURBATION</p>\n\n<p>A man who has engaged in alot of porn and or masturbation might struggle to hold an erection or, his mind might register pleasure as that got using his hand, not a vagina. Tell him \u201cHoney, you have me, keep your hand away from the penis that I am to satisfy\u201d</p>\n\n<p>6. HAVE THE S3X TALK</p>\n\n<p>Be safe and free with each other to talk about anything sexual</p>\n\n<p>7.

that is straining existing facilities.\n\nThe Principal of Kanga High School Michael Ogweno called for the education stakeholders look into improving infrastructure in schools to accommodate many

we have a shortage of infrastructure in our dormitories, laboratories and even classrooms,\u201d he said.\n\nThe principal said that the number of students that a laboratory can hold is about 50 but currently most classes in the school have a large population of more than 50 students and it is a challenge when doing the science practicals.\n\nThe dormitories whose cubicles are supposed to have four beds have been forced to have six or even more due to limited space.\n\nKanga national school and many others are asking for the stakeholders and other well wishers to help them fund infrastructure to meet hundred transition policy from Primary to Secondary school.\n\nThe principal added that the school has only managed to improve part of its infrastructure from the savings it has been having but still lacks the resources as the buildings in the school were put up at the onset of the school in 1985 but much needs to be done to further improve our infrastructure.\n\nThe Kanga

I didn\u2019t have to join politics to champion for women.\u201d\n\nThe legislator who wears a happy smiley face throughout our conversation says the urge to take her activism and push the She Agenda a notch higher through active politics caught up with her during the campaigns ahead of the passing of the Constitution of Kenya in 2010.\n\n\u201cWe were campaigning to have a new Constitution in this country as a civil activist where I invested my time and resources to push the agenda through. That is when I realised we can do more at a higher level of policy formulation,\u201d she said.\n\nThrough her NGO, she raised funds that she used to sponsor girls from her marginalised community that is still striving to embrace girl-child education.\n\nShe also held forums with stakeholders from the community to stamp out the retrogressive cultures of \u2018the cut\u2019 and subsequent early marriages.\n\nSince her election in 2013, she has continued to preside over various activities aimed at improving the lives of women and girls within the county and the nation at large.\n\nWhen she came to power, the first thing she did was help women to register into groups and form Saccos to help increase their voice in seeking tenders and funds.\n\nThe legislator also launched table banking to promote economic and social empowerment of women as they loan each other at low interest rates. She did that at a function presided over by Rachel Ruto, the Deputy President\u2019s wife.\n\nAs the county patron of Uwezo Fund, Ghati says her office has helped train women and people living with disability to be economically empowered before receiving the funds.\n\n\u201cMy office has also partnered with development partners and financial institutions to offer financial training on entrepreneurship and offer soft loans to youth groups and women Saccos,\u201d Ghati says.\n\nThe Women\u2019s Representative also has plans lined up to have the affirmative action funds, though she says they arrived late, to help at least two groups in Migori County\u2019s 40 wards. Already eight have benefitted in Rongo constituency.\n\nElsewhere, in order to improve girl child education through her \u2018Sister Mentors\u2019 programme where girls are encouraged on the value of education, good communication and sound reproductive health, the MP is set to give bursaries worth Sh3.6 million to more than 300 girls in the first round.\n\nShe, however, confesses that the fight and push for the woman agenda has not been an easy task. For instance, though she has performed tremendously in efforts to stamp out FGM from the Kuria community, there has been a lot of resistance.\n\nShe says though culture is not something that you can wake up and wish away, a lot needs to be done to create awareness and push for political goodwill, which she emphasizes still lacks. This makes many women shy from speaking against FGM.\n\n\u201cFrom where I sit I have to fight alone as a leader as my colleagues fear if they raise the issue they might lose votes in elections. This has been painful,\u201d the women representative noted.\n\nThe otherwise detrimental factor, which she attributes to intimidate women from leadership, generally, is the patriarchal history of the national leadership. This has scared off most first time legislators but again, she says, women leaders have adapted appropriately.\n\nAnother factor that she admits has slowed her down but has not dampened her spirit is an accident that has seen her bound to a wheel chair. Dannitah appreciates the understanding Migori residents have accorded her. \u201cMy constituents gave me time to heal; it has been two years since I went down on a wheelchair. They never gave me a lot of pressure and they have been kind, which has made me to continue with my work without any hitch as I have done exceedingly well in covering all eight constituencies and 40 wards,\u201d says Ghati.\n\nShe credits her family members together with her six-year-old daughter for being of \u201ca lot of support\u2019\u2019 to her in adopting to the reality that she has to move around in a wheel chair.\n\nBut Ghati, who is the secretary at Orange Democratic Movement\u2019s (ODM) National Executive Council, can\u2019t stop without boasting of having great support from CORD co-principle and ODM patron Raila Odinga, who has been with her throughout her difficult times.\n\n\u201cThe best supporter has been my party leader Raila Odinga, who has been with me from the days I was in hospital. I always see it in his eyes and it\u2019s every time we meet that he remembers my energy before the accident. That\u2019s enough,\u201d Ghati said.\n\nGhati floored four contestants to emerge Migori County\u2019s premiere Women representative on an ODM ticket. But she still feels that legislator\u2019s in previous and current governments have not prioritized women. She believes that with the Constitution, the country is headed for a bright future.\n\n\u201cIt is sad that as a country we still struggle to see if we can add more women in leadership while other countries like Tanzania, Rwanda and Sudan have gone far ahead. We still can\u2019t prioritize women, but as women legislators we will struggle to reverse this since it is not over till it is over,\u201d notes Ghati.\n\nShe says her condition will not stop her from serving her people and hopes to still be in politics come 2022. \u201cI only urge my members never to feel intimidated to campaign across the county because I did it without a godfather like others had. I got votes across all communities as my position was never negotiated by communities,\u201d she implored.\n\nGhati, who decries that flop of the \u2018Gender Bill\u2019 a second time, says women who have ascended to various leadership positions, though few, have done much to front the gender agenda and deserve a pat on the back.", "articleBodyHtml": "<article>\n\n<p><a href=\"http://www.migorinews.co.ke/wp-content/uploads/2015/04/Ghati.jpg\"><img src=\"http://www.migorinews.co.ke/wp-content/uploads/2015/04/Ghati-200x300.jpg\" alt=\"Dennitah Ghati\" srcset=\"https://www.migorinews.co.ke/wp-content/uploads/2015/04/Ghati-200x300.jpg 200w, https://www.migorinews.co.ke/wp-content/uploads/2015/04/Ghati-682x1024.jpg 682w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 200px) 100vw, 200px\"></a>By TIMOTHY MBAYA via Kenyan Weekly</p>\n\n<p>\u201cFirst women are not in leadership position by mistake, it\u2019s the duty of every country to ensure women are in leadership,\u201d says Migori County\u2019s Women representative Dennitah Ghati who The Kenyan weekly recently paid a visit at her office in Migori town.</p>\n\n<p>For a woman who started her life at Maeta Village in Kuria East constituency, Ghati has scaled the heights of journalism, activism and politics to become the first woman from the marginalized Kuria community to be elected a legislator.</p>\n\n<p>The young legislator laughs easily and gesticulates energetically as The Kenyan Weekly seeks to know about her life in politics and work she did to end Female Genital Mutilation in her community and empower women across the globe.</p>\n\n<p>\u201cI think activism had stayed with me for long before joining Migori politics.

It is endowed with massive natural resources including mineral resources. The county has been allocated Sh4.1B by the Commission for Revenue Allocation this financial year 2013/2014.\n\nHon WILLIAM MWITA ABEDI MAROA, the County Member for Masaba Ward in Kuria West Constituency and chairman of Committee on Budget and Appropriation spoke to our writer ATIENO OTIENO on the county budget, a process which begun on 30th April 2013 and what residents should expect in this financial year.\n\nMigori News: Briefly explain the process of making the county budget?\nHon Abedi Maroa: Budget making is not an activity but a very long process which starts on 31st August every calendar year. The current budget didn\u2019t go through the full cycle as elections were done on March 4th and swearing in done on April 22nd. This meant that as a committee there was a lot of things we didn\u2019t do as that was carried by the Transition Authority which midwifes the budget making for all Counties.\n\nMN: When exactly was your committee engaged during the budget making process then?\nAM: 30th April, interim Principal Finance Officer and Assembly Clerk submitted executive and assembly budget estimates respectively for the current financial year. Later the speaker collected views from different sectors and committees like agriculture and roads which were tabled before our committee which took a five day retreat to come up with the budget. The final outcome was on June 29th with a budget of Sh5.3billion where the assembly was allocated Sh875Million with the rest going to the executive.\n\nMN: Why did executive get the lion share of the budget at Sh4.1billion?\nAM: Most of development is done by the executive while the assembly just does the oversight, but Sh2million is awarded to 40 ward offices for residents to feel devolution closer to them through development.\n\nMN: The Constitution puts a lot of emphasis on citizen participation, at what point did you involve county residents?\nAM: The public participated at Maranatha Hall in Migori town to debate on budget estimates and appropriation bill. After this public input we came up with the Migori County Appropriation Bill No. 1 which was accented to by the Governor on the June 30th to be an Act of Parliament to govern implementation of the budget.\n\nMN: Migori is one of counties whose budgets were returned by the Controller of Budget, what happened?\nAM: We had to comply with the requirement to have a balanced budget as our first one had Sh1.2billion deficit.\nMN: In this budget Transport and Road had the highest allocation at Sh300m followed by Health\u2019s Sh260m and Water and Energy with Sh263m, what priorities lead in sharing of funds?\nAM: The roads and transport department got the highest allocation because there is a need to open up new road networks especially in the rural areas to connect the farmers to the market. Health department is fully devolved and we needed to open new dispensaries as well as improve efficient drug supply to our hospitals. While clean water and electricity supply to families and learning institutions was also key in allocation.\n\nMN: What is a Supplementary Budget?\nAM: This is the spending ability of the county and we have a lot of surplus in the recurrent expenditure. Let\u2019s say we allocate Sh100,000 to run an officer and for two years and in Sh20,000 is used to have a surplus of Sh80,000 while in the second year only Sh30,000 is used. This creates a surplus which will require a supplementary budget to manage this \u2018floating\u2019 money.\n\nMN: So when is the county expecting a supplementary budget?\nAM: We are in the process recruiting a chi officer in charge of finance who will tell us on expenditure or where the budget is low before we see what is in supplement.\nAreas to seek for supplementary will be the new MTC as there are new students to be admitted and in establishing a county radio station and later a TV studio which will assist in disseminating information to residents and also air live assembly proceedings.\n\nMN: We have reports that over Sh70m for the county weren\u2019t spent in first transition allocation, were the money taken back to the Treasury?\nAM: This was a rumour and like all rumours it lacks any iota of truth in it. Under the Public Finance Management Act all money to the county and CDF are safeguarded and in case of the county it is held as a trust in the Central Bank. So any amount not spent will still remain in the treasury.\nWhen county wants its money it will make requisition to the office of the Controller of Budget for the money to be released to the County Operation Account and later to various spending account.\n\nMN: What measures are in place to increase revenue collection?\nAM: We have several loopholes in the finance department especially the receipting system where fake receipts are many. But I believe that the Finance Bill which will be law by end of this year will offer the best remedy to seal these loopholes. The bill has heavy penalties and fines for offenders.\n\nMN: Devolution has been in effect for over 8 months, how can you rate and compare Migori county nationally?\nAM: It\u2019s a short a time to rate counties because money for implementation only came in early September and two months period is short to achieve much. But the county has made major strides we have a decent assembly, governor and his deputy offices.\nWe have in place an Integrated Development Plan which is our development blue print. We have many ongoing development projects but people over expectation have clouded the gains made.\n\nMN: There is a lot of talk about Migori being unable to get foreign investors compared to other counties.\nAM: Foreign investors don\u2019t come to do things for free; they\u2019ll have investments which will have to be secured by land lease of up to a century which will be gagging us. We shouldn\u2019t have poverty mentality where when you see a Mzungu, even a carpenter, is seen as an investor. So when the governor tells residents to invest in our county doesn\u2019t mean we can\u2019t get foreign investors. We have residents, and those living in Diaspora who can invest home.\n\nMN: What measures is the County Assembly putting in place to curb Corruption?\nAM: The assembly has three mandates key among them being oversight which we are currently enforcing. At the moment the Public Accounts Committee is doing a number of investigations, already several people have appeared before it. We want to ensure that corruption isn\u2019t devolved in Migori. What was budgeted and every shilling used will be accounted for, believe me on that.\n\nMN: Any other upcoming bill within your committee?\nAM: There is Wards Development Fund Bill which is a replica of the CDF which recommends at least 10 percent of annual county budget being allocated to wards. So in the current budget of Sh5.3billion the assembly will be allocated Sh530million which if shared among 40 wards will see a Sh10million allocation each.\n\nMN: Internal revenue collection was pushed to Sh1billion in a year by the assembly; do you think this can be achieved?\nAM: Yes, we have that potential in first months we only collected Sh9million which has been pushed to Sh24million in a month. When all loopholes are sealed we can hit Sh80million per month.\n\nMN: Your partying shot to county residents?\nAM: Residents should criticise their government both negatively and positively with open eyes focused on good things. As a member of the assembly we are ready to work for them.", "articleBodyHtml": "<article>\n\n<figure><a href=\"http://www.migorinews.co.ke/wp-content/uploads/2015/03/Abedi-Maroa-Migori-News.jpg\"><img src=\"http://www.migorinews.co.ke/wp-content/uploads/2015/03/Abedi-Maroa-Migori-News-300x198.jpg\" alt=\"Abedi Maroa\" srcset=\"https://www.migorinews.co.ke/wp-content/uploads/2015/03/Abedi-Maroa-Migori-News-300x198.jpg 300w, https://www.migorinews.co.ke/wp-content/uploads/2015/03/Abedi-Maroa-Migori-News.jpg 1024w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 300px) 100vw, 300px\"></a><figcaption><p>Abedi Maroa</p></figcaption></figure>\n\n<p>Migori County is considered among one of the richest among the 47 in the country.
