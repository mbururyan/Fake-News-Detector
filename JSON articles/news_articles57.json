The true science of economics is contextual, not universal.\n\nWhat might a contextual approach to inflation imply today?\n\nCurrent inflation in the US and many other advanced economies differs significantly from the inflation of the late 1970s.\n\nIt is neither chronic, nor driven by wage-price spirals and backward indexation.\n\nInflationary pressure seems to derive largely from a transitory set of factors, such as the pandemic-related reallocation of spending from services to goods, and supply-chain and other disruptions to production.\n\nWhile expansionary monetary and fiscal policies have boosted incomes, these policies, too, are temporary.\n\nThe alternative would have been a dramatic collapse in employment and living standards.\n\nUnder current circumstances, then, policymakers in developed countries should not over-react to the spike in inflation.\n\nAs the historian Adam Toozehas argued, transitory inflation calls for a restrained response, whether through regulation or monetary policy.\n\nThe best argument against price controls is not that they are \u201cincompatible with science\u201d but that nothing so radical needs to be considered for now.\n\nThe same caution would apply to orthodox policy as well: central banks should be patient before raising interest rates.\n\nWhat about Erdo\u011fan\u2019s continued insistence that high inflation is the result rather than the cause of high interest rates?\n\nThe validity of his argument has always been in doubt, given that Turkey\u2019s macroeconomic imbalances are legion and have been building up for quite some time.\n\nEven when an argument cannot be settled beforehand, facts eventually allow us to distinguish among theories that do and do not make sense in a given place.\n\nIn Turkey\u2019s case, the evidence that has accumulated since policymakers embarked on Erdo\u011fan\u2019s experiment speaks loudly and clearly.\n\nEconomists should be humble when they recommend (or dismiss) various inflation-fighting strategies.\n\nAnd while policymakers must pay attention to economic evidence and arguments, they should be skeptical when the economists who advise them display excessive confidence.\n\nFrom the web", "articleBodyHtml": "<article>\n\n<figure><img src=\"https://www.pd.co.ke/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/Nairobians-shop-at-Carrefour-Mega-Supermarket-800x500.gif\" alt=\"\" srcset=\"https://www.pd.co.ke/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/Nairobians-shop-at-Carrefour-Mega-Supermarket-800x500.gif 800w, https://www.pd.co.ke/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/Nairobians-shop-at-Carrefour-Mega-Supermarket-480x300.gif 480w, https://www.pd.co.ke/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/Nairobians-shop-at-Carrefour-Mega-Supermarket-225x141.gif 225w, https://www.pd.co.ke/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/Nairobians-shop-at-Carrefour-Mega-Supermarket-768x480.gif 768w, https://www.pd.co.ke/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/Nairobians-shop-at-Carrefour-Mega-Supermarket-115x72.gif 115w, https://www.pd.co.ke/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/Nairobians-shop-at-Carrefour-Mega-Supermarket-640x400.gif 640w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 500px) 100vw, 500px\">\n<figcaption>\nNairobians shop at Carrefour Mega Supermarket at Uhuru Highway.

The true science of economics is\u00a0contextual, not universal.</p>\n\n<p>What might a contextual approach to inflation imply today?</p>\n\n<p>Current inflation in the US and many other advanced economies differs significantly from the inflation of the late 1970s.</p>\n\n<p>It is neither chronic, nor driven by wage-price spirals and backward indexation.</p>\n\n<p>Inflationary pressure seems to derive\u00a0largely\u00a0from a transitory set of factors, such as the pandemic-related reallocation of spending from services to goods, and supply-chain and other disruptions to production.</p>\n\n<p>While expansionary monetary and fiscal policies have boosted incomes, these policies, too, are temporary.</p>\n\n<p>The alternative would have been a dramatic collapse in employment and living standards.</p>\n\n<p>Under current circumstances, then, policymakers in developed countries should not over-react to the spike in inflation.</p>\n\n<p>As the historian\u00a0Adam Toozehas\u00a0argued, transitory inflation calls for a restrained response, whether through regulation or monetary policy.</p>\n\n<p>The best argument against price controls is not that they are \u201cincompatible with science\u201d but that nothing so radical needs to be considered for now.</p>\n\n<p>The same caution would apply to orthodox policy as well: central banks should be patient before raising interest rates.</p>\n\n<p>What about Erdo\u011fan\u2019s continued insistence that high inflation is the result rather than the cause of high interest rates?</p>\n\n<p>The validity of his argument has always been in doubt, given that Turkey\u2019s macroeconomic imbalances are legion and have been building up for quite some time.</p>\n\n<p>Even when an argument cannot be settled beforehand, facts eventually allow us to distinguish among theories that do and do not make sense in a given place.</p>\n\n<p>In Turkey\u2019s case, the evidence that has accumulated since policymakers embarked on Erdo\u011fan\u2019s experiment speaks loudly and clearly.</p>\n\n<p>Economists should be humble when they recommend (or dismiss) various inflation-fighting strategies.</p>\n\n<p>And while policymakers must pay attention to economic evidence and arguments, they should be skeptical when the economists who advise them display excessive confidence.</p>\n\n<p><strong>From the web</strong></p>\n\n</article>", "canonicalUrl": "https://www.pd.co.ke/opinion/science-of-economics-is-contextual-not-universal-109382/"},{"url": "https://www.pd.co.ke/news/raila-to-launch-his-2022-state-house-campaign-in-thika-109421/", "probability": 0.9859254, "headline": "Raila to launch his 2022 State House campaign in Thika", "datePublished": "2022-01-12T00:00:00+03:00", "datePublishedRaw": "2022-01-12T00:00:00+03:00", "dateModified": "2022-01-12T06:31:25+03:00", "dateModifiedRaw": "2022-01-12T06:31:25+03:00", "author": "Rawlings Otieno", "authorsList": ["Rawlings Otieno"], "inLanguage": "en", "mainImage": "https://www.pd.co.ke/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/George-Mwaura-a-member-of-Kiambu-Youth-for-Baba.jpg", "images": ["https://www.pd.co.ke/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/George-Mwaura-a-member-of-Kiambu-Youth-for-Baba.jpg"], "description": "Orange party leader Raila Odinga will on Saturday kick off his State House campaign in President Uhuru Kenyatta\u2019s backyard, a major signal that the Central Kenya vote is at the heart of his election strategy.", "articleBody": "Orange party leader Raila Odinga will on Saturday kick off his State House campaign in President Uhuru Kenyatta\u2019s backyard, a major signal that the Central Kenya vote is at the heart of his election strategy.\n\nRaila will lead the Azimio La Umoja brigade to Thika, Kiambu County, where he is set to hold what will be his first campaign rally in the election year.\n\nThika has some nostalgic significance for Raila, having been the venue at which he launched his 2005 campaign against the draft Constitution alongside Uhuru and other members of the Orange team.\n\nThe campaign would culminate in the defeat of the Constitution, that was being spearheaded by President Mwai Kibaki and eventual formation of the Orange Democratic Movement (ODM).\n\nIt created momentum for the hotly contested 2007 General Election between the two, leading to post-election violence.\n\n\u201cOn Saturday, the Azimio La Umoja movement will be in Thika.

revenue exemptions by the government are causing undue pressure to the formal sectors of the economy, experts have warned, urging the government to consider fiscal consolidation.\n\nA report by the Institute of Public Finance Kenya (IPFK) and Oxford Policy Management\u2019s study says revenue generated is declining despite economic growth.\n\n\u201cWhen we compare the rate at which Kenya\u2019s revenue is growing as a share of the gross domestic product (GDP), we see that it has been nominally growing, but as a share of the total economy is declining,\u201d reads the report on Kenya\u2019s 2022 Economic Outlook, which was unveiled at a Nairobi hotel yesterday.\n\nThe experts are now urging the government to stick to its fiscal consolidation path in the upcoming 2021-22 budget revision and 2022/23 budget, despite previous failed attempts.\n\nJames Muraguri, IPFK chief executive said Kenya government\u2019s debt policy has reduced the country\u2019s ability to respond to shocks that may arise.\n\nTax policy framework\n\nHe said development of the new National Tax Policy Framework to be released in 2021/22 promises to outline new measures to boost revenue performance, including reversal of the many exemptions and exclusions that have plagued Kenya\u2019s performance for many years.\n\n\u201cIt is especially important, but is politically difficult, so must be monitored closely,\u201d Muraguri added.\n\nThe institute said that Kenya is experiencing a growing informal sector which is not contributing substantially into the revenue, thereby emerging as a burden to the formal sector to generate this revenue.\n\nIt warns that economic damage caused by Covid-19 is worse than originally anticipated, with a downturn that leaves the GDP approximately 9 per cent below Kenya\u2019s pre-crisis forecast by 2023.\n\nPrior to the Covid-19 crisis, IPFK added, Kenya\u2019s public finances were managed in an unsustainable manner, which made the country vulnerable to shocks, stopped the government from mounting a very significant stimulus in 2019/20, and now leaves it with a pressing need for fiscal consolidation going forward.\n\nAs a country whose debt carrying capacity has massively downgraded from strong to medium signalling increased liquidity risks due to the government spending a larger share of the country\u2019s revenues on debt payments, it adds, Kenya remains at high risk of debt distress and as a result, fiscal space will be highly constrained for several years.\n\nThe country\u2019s fiscal deficit is projected to fall back to 4.5 per cent by 2023/24, from highs of over 8 per cent of GDP in 2020/21. The survey further exposed the impact that fiscal consolidation will have on the county government finances.\n\n\u201cGovernment plans for fiscal consolidation are set to have a major impact on the finances of county governments, which if carried through, will have major implications for service delivery going forward,\u201d added the institute\u2019s Head of Research, John Nyangi.\n\nFiscal deficits\n\nSo far in 2021-22, he added, transfers are on average behind schedule by two months. Fiscal deficits of 8 per cent of GDP in 2019/20 and 2020/21 (estimated) are expected to push debt to over 70 per cent of GDP by the end of 2021/22, with Kenya continuing to be assessed as being at high risk of debt distress by the International Monetary Fund (IMF).\n\nGovernment plans to narrow the deficit signals significant cuts in public spending from 2022/23 onwards, at both levels of government, Muraguri said, adding that the Public Financial Management (PFM) system in Kenya still faces some critical weaknesses.\n\n\u201cThe national government has continued to make efforts to strengthen budget transparency, but county information is limited.\n\nAt the time of writing, county governments had not made their FY 2021/22 budgets publicly available, and there continues to be no \u2018one-stop shop\u2019 for accessing county budgets,\u201d he added.", "articleBodyHtml": "<article>\n\n<figure><img src=\"https://www.pd.co.ke/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/Institute-of-Public-Finance-CEO-James-Muraguri-right-and-Head-of-Research-John-Nyangi.jpg\" alt=\"\">\n<figcaption>\nInstitute of Public Finance CEO James Muraguri (right) and\u00a0Head of Research John Nyangi compare notes during the launch yesterday.

It has forced me to purchase a good graphics tablet and a computer that runs smoothly for efficiency at work.\n\nThe pandemic has also changed how work and meetings are done in relation to advertising and digital marketing,\u201d he notes.\n\nHe also observes that more people will be inclined to digital drawings compared to realism leading to the rise in the number of artists who do such type.\n\nHe says, \u201cI think more people are into this kind of art since the pictures are more manipulative and they can change a lot of things if the pictures are drawings like the size of an eye or the style of the hair.\u201d\n\nIn July 2021, there was a national visual art residency in Nairobi, the first of its kind in the country. Represented by 40 up-and-coming artists from 16 counties, it took place for 10 days at the Karen Village arts centre.\n\nWhile some private galleries and art collectives have offered curated residencies, there has been nothing done to the scale of national residency.\n\nThis birthed the creation of the Association of Visual Arts and Collectives (AVAC), a non-profit association that aims at building partnerships between the arts community and government.\n\n\u201cThe residency aimed at bringing together budding artists to produce artworks under the tutelage and mentoring of accomplished artists in their respective fields,\u201d says Dr Kiprop Lagat, culture director at the Sports, Culture and Heritage ministry.\n\nThe year too saw a rise in art fairs, exhibitions and workshops while observing the Covid-19 protocols.\n\nIt also saw some artists breaking the traditional use of galleries to sell their art in hotels, restaurants, hospitals, any space that their art can be appreciated.\n\nThe year 2021 also saw a proposal presented by the National Museum of Kenya (NMK) to the government to create a national art gallery.\n\nIt would be a place where the significant role of art in documenting the historical, social as well as the cultural evolution of a country is appreciated.\n\nThe artists also came together to talk about mental health affecting artists in a group exhibition by the Brush Tu Artists\u2019 Collective held at the Alliance Fran\u00e7aise, Nairobi, in September.\n\n\u201cThe exhibition sought to suggest methods of coping with mental, emotional and other health issues that might have been brought about by the pandemic,\u201d artist Michael Musyoka says.\n\nThe exhibition featured works by nine of of the collective\u2019s 12 artists namely: Boniface Maina, Michael Musyoka, Sebawali Sio, Kimani Ngaru, Abdul Kipruto, Moira Bushkimani, Lincoln Mwangi, Peteros Ndunde and Emmaus Kimani.\n\nAnother major issue in the year that was, is the on-going debates on the repatriation of cultural artefacts that were plundered during the colonial era.\n\nIcon bows out\n\nLast but not least, we ended the year with the loss of an icon in the art scene.\n\nAlan Donovan, who dedicated his life in collecting and promoting African art in Kenya and beyond the continent, died on December 5, 2021.\n\nTogether with the former Vice President Joseph Murumbi, the two created the African Heritage Gallery that was built between 1989 and 1994 in Mlolongo, Machakos county.\n\nIt\u2019s inspiration was drawn from the mud architecture of the Great Mosque of Djenn\u00e9 in Mali.\n\nThe house was declared a national monument in 2016 and has been dubbed Africa\u2019s most photographed house.\n\nIn May 2021, Donovan had expressed the intention to sell his life-long investment in the gallery for Sh320 million.\n\nSports, Culture and Heritage CS Amina Mohamed stated during Donovan\u2019s funeral last December that the government would continue to support his vision.\n\n\u201cWe will continue working on this project together and make this vision come true.\n\nNot for Alan, but for each and every one of us and every African child coming after us,\u201d said Amina.\n\nNevertheless, art sector stakeholders remain positive that 2022 will present great opportunities for the African art, which in the long-run will prove beneficial for artistes, especially for their financial well-being.\n\nFrom the web", "articleBodyHtml": "<article>\n\n<figure><img

He is back in studio for his sixth album, and chats with Elly Gitau about the new project, challenges, triumphs and New Year aspirations\n\nHow does it feel to be alive this new year?\n\nI feel lucky to be alive! I had the highest selling album with Strength in Numbers (SiN) in 2020, I was a judge on the two biggest talent shows in Uganda, I did a brand ambassadorship with three other companies and came out of the year alive.\n\nAlthough we happened to lose a few close people to the Covid-19 pandemic, it\u2019s good to be alive.\n\nKampala is still on lockdown due to the pandemic. How did you personally celebrate your festivities?\n\nI spent my time out on the farm. I\u2019d usually have shows back-to-back if it wasn\u2019t for the lockdown.\n\nMy mum moved to the village full time as well, so I was good to go out there and spend some time.\n\nIn the almost last two years, how has the pandemic affected the creatives in Uganda?\n\nI feel like there were a lot of young creatives who came out with the right material and a lot of executives who had invested heavily into artistes.\n\nSeeing returns on your money in music should be almost instant when you have a hit, but waiting for six months, a year, then two years is too much.\n\nI\u2019m sure many future greats have turned away from music altogether. It\u2019s impossible to quantify all the great music we have lost. Salute to those who are still ready to fight.\n\nWhat\u2019s your secret to remaining such a force to reckon with in the region\u2019s hip-hop scenes?\n\nI think staying close to the art form is always the best way. That and dropping a freestyle now and again to remind them about the legacy goes a long way.\n\nUnfortunately, the radio is always going to push out \u201cthe hit\u201d, but thank God for albums.\n\nThis is where we are able to let people know where our talent lies and what we are truly all about.\n\nWorking hard and staying loyal as well. I\u2019ve worked with lot of people over the years, and I\u2019ve seen them on their way up and down.\n\nThe way people act when they\u2019ve made it was always \u201cthem\u201d; they were just playing you on their way up.\n\nI always stay respectful and loyal to everybody in my circle. That\u2019s why I\u2019m still here.\n\nWho is the greatest inspiration in your music career?\n\nOf course family comes first. They played the music in the house; they moved me and put that battery in my back with encouragement and inspiration. I think one of my greatest inspirations would be Afrigo Band.\n\nThey\u2019ve held down long careers in Uganda and travelled the world with no videos for their music.\n\nThey go fan by fan, live performing. Their foundation is incredible. Then MC Afrique challenged me as a conscious emcee to see what it takes to go commercial because nobody else was willing to take our \u2018Ugaflow\u2019 to Africa.\n\nAfrique passed away before he could even see me get even one of those 60 awards I have won since.\n\nGive us your personal outlook on the current hip-hop scenes in East Africa. Are we making progress as a music bloc or appealing to the international market?\n\nThe scene is so alive. We\u2019ve got people at every level doing their thing. I think for music in general, if we continue to see ourselves as five separate countries then we\u2019ll be dead in the waters.\n\nWe need to move as a block. If people in UG can\u2019t name a Khaligraph or Diamond\u2019s single when it drops, people in Congo don\u2019t know when Nyashinki\u2019s album is coming out, if people don\u2019t know where to download Navio\u2019s music in Burundi, then we are in trouble.\n\nIf we are together then the numbers make sense to conquer that international market.\n\nYou are working on a new album Vibes Out The East, how is the progress?\n\nThe album is going to be a beast. I\u2019m about half way through, but as usual I want to bury myself in the studio for a week for the last seven or eight songs.\n\nI always like giving people a real snapshot of me as I am at that present moment in time. You can only do that with back-to-back work in the studio.\n\nHow different will this album be compared to your previous one?\n\nMy last album SiN was collaboration heavy, but I think this project has some stand out singles with just me doing me.\n\nI\u2019m going to save the collabos that we do as surprise, but rest assured this is going to be a slice of bars , a good vibe and a side of Navio people haven\u2019t seen before.\n\nRaha is the first jam off the upcoming project. What are its influences and inspirations?\n\nRaha is a feel good song that Uganda needed right now. We\u2019ve come out of two years of lockdown and curfew.\n\nI wanted to drop something in time for getting us all back on the streets again. Something present that could be felt Africawide.\n\nRemember we\u2019ve been locked up, so the clubs are the first place we are checking into.\n\nI linked up with Daxochali on the beat from Tanzania on this one and Sasha Vybz on a monster video. I\u2019m just excited to see what happens once I get on stage with this one.\n\nWhy did you choose to experiment with Amapiano on Raha?\n\nI had seen a war breaking out about people rapping on Amapiano beats and I thought to myself, I am \u201cThe OG\u201d and we can all do what we want.\n\nSnoop Dogg can sing over 70s disco music, then reinvent himself through reggae as Snoop Lion for a few summers.\n\nBut never forget that he\u2019s same artiste who dropped Doggystle and his level of rap artistry is unquestionable.\n\nLet\u2019s the youngsters breathe and keep breaking ground in other genres. It doesn\u2019t do any harm to add to your portfolio.\n\nWhen can we expect Vibes Out The East to be released?\n\nIn less than two months. I\u2019m definitely excited to be back out with a project for my fans that have always been there.\n\nMy Kenyan fans, especially are no nonsense, so I always have to have some lines just for them to vibe to.\n\nWhat\u2019s your new year\u2019s message for your fans?\n\nThank you so much for allowing a 20-plus-year rap career to flourish in East Africa. There\u2019s something special about our music that the world is now getting a taste of.\n\nWe need to rally together not just as countries, but the whole East Africa as a movement.", "articleBodyHtml": "<article>\n\n<p>By\n\n, People Daily Digital <br> |   5 mins read</p>\n\n<figure><img src=\"https://www.pd.co.ke/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/Navio.jpg\" alt=\"\">\n<figcaption>\nRapper Navio.\n</figcaption></figure>\n\n<p><strong>Navio</strong><em> is an iconic Ugandan hip-hop artiste and record producer, with a career spanning more than 20 years now.

However, 2022 promises better tidings for the showbiz scenes, as Chebet Korir predicts.\n\nThe future cannot be predicted, not least the future of the showbiz scene in Kenya.\n\nIt was impossible to make any predictions in 2020, as there was minimal movement, and barely any virtual events due to the Covid-19 pandemic, which spiraled into 2021.\n\nHowever, a ray of hope shines down on us this year, as the country is still adjusting, venues are reopening, concerts are back a big deal and musicians are doing their best to give us quality music as they sparkle with potential and success that cannot be predestined.\n\nAs this goes on, 2022 is also a political year where we will also see a number of celebrities engaging in the political campaigns.\n\nOn November 8, 2021, the Kenya Copyright Board (Kecobo) issued a statement urging musicians who seek to gain from the political activities to be wise by engaging the help of lawyers in negotiating the terms of their services with the politicians.\n\nThis, said the board, was to ensure that they enter written and legally abiding contracts with the politicians.\n\nWell, not all is lost, as this year has the potential of serving the showbiz sector right, if all goes well.\n\nIn this regard, here are Spice\u2019s crystal ball predictions on what 2022 will look like for the Kenya\u2019s creative sector.\n\nDrill music takeover\n\nDrill is a style or trap music that originated from Chicago in the USA and blew up in Kenya in 2020.\n\nAs it\u2019s slowly gaining momentum, the sound will take over this year and also create a mainstream lane for itself.\n\nThe likes of Wakadinali (Scar, Domani Munga and Sewersydaa) will take drill music to the next level.\n\nThey have been around for quite some time now as their songs blew up early last year with millions of views and streams on the digital platforms. We predict a good year for them.\n\nOther drill sensations Buruklyn Boyz will release massive hits with new collaborations as well. We will also see new acts showcasing their drill skills and it will be a favourite for many fans.\n\nAs the new genre will be buzzing in Nairobi, hip-hop will still make it big in 2022, with acts such as Khaligraph Jones taking it to the next level.\n\nIn 2021, he debuted a single dubbed Papa Wemba featuring some of Kenya\u2019s hip-hop heads UB, Zaka, Gaza, Agano, Chiwawa, Kenrazy and Visita, which did quite well in the music charts.\n\nWe will see more of our hip-hop artistes releasing more music, which we can\u2019t wait for. The likes of Trio Mio who had a promising year will serve an abundance of club bangers.\n\nProbably one of his songs will be used in the political campaigns. Breeder LW and Boutross will also shine this year with some of their addictive hits and collaborations.\n\nWomen empowerment\n\nOur local female artistes outdid themselves last year and this year will not be any different.\n\nSirudi Home hitmaker Maandy will give us sultry jams in the first quarter of the year and we just can\u2019t wait.\n\nA possible collaboration with a big artiste is what we would love to hear from her.\n\nJovial will give us jolly tracks and we will see her music going international. Adasa is a female artiste hailing from the coastal region.\n\nShe is known for her song Najikakamua featuring Benzema. She is one of the best untapped performers from Mombasa and she will surprise us this year as she will grace our screens with her powerful voice and her amazing dance moves.\n\nSai Kenya is also an artiste to look out for, with Xenia Manasseh and Nikita Kering poised to take Kenyan music to global charts.\n\nThe nightlife experience\n\nBusinesses are slowly recovering from the pandemic and the nightlife will be lit this year, as clubs rush to offer exclusive glitz and glam for revellers.\n\nClubs have been sprouting, and by the look of things, there will be more club openings and club appearances.\n\nFor instance, the VIP Volume Club located in Shanzu, Mombasa, and owned by former Nairobi Governor Mike Sonko has been the talk of town in the recent times.\n\nWord is that they might jet in iconic American R&B group Boys 2 Men for the official launch.\n\nIn Nairobi, Casavera Lounge on Ngong Road and co-owned by dancehall and gengetone artiste KRG The Don is also a place to dine and enjoy good music.\n\nA number of well-known personalities have made an appearance there including Jamaican dancehall star Konshens.\n\nThika and Kiambu roads are also doing well, with more clubs coming up such as the Skypark Lounge, Paris Lounge, and The Loft, among others.\n\nEnd of road for Amapiano\n\nI believe we\u2019ve all had enough of the Amapiano sound. It did quite well last year as most events revolved around it.\n\nBut let\u2019s face it, it wasn\u2019t here to stay; Kenyans will just move on to the next musical culture that crops up.\n\nContent without barriers\n\nContent creation will continue to evolve at a rapid pace. We predict content creators will continuously push for better representation.\n\nAbel Mutua has been keeping us glued on our screens with some of his entertaining Wakurugenzi stories and this year we want more.\n\nTerence Creative will diversify his content, Diana Marua will also give us some fresh family content laced with top-shelf drama, and Eddy Butita will be going mega by releasing more short and lengthy movies.\n\nFilm industry growth\n\nThis year, the Kenyan film industry will take over Africa and beyond. In 2021, we had more than 11 television shows and web series including Crime and Justice and Monica that did well.\n\nWe had over 10 feature films such as Nafsi, Just in Time, and Baba Twins, and more than 40 short films including The Last Christmas, Kutu and What If.\n\nIt feels good seeing our own content being showcased on international streaming platforms and Kenyans will continue to support the local content as it goes a notch higher this year.\n\nUp-and-coming acts\n\nDespite being a political year, a lot of up-and-coming acts will have a smooth ride in the first quarter of the year.\n\nJeremy Maina alias Lil Maina has already graced our screens with his addictive track Kishash, which has already become a TikTok trend.\n\nWe predict a good year for him. Maya Amolo is also a fresh face in the music scene. Despite releasing a few singles in 2021 she deserves to shine this year with her beautiful vocals.\n\nYoungster Trio Mio will also continue with his glittering upward projection.\n\nMore album releases\n\nWouldn\u2019t it be a good way to start off the year with albums? Sauti Sol\u2019s Savara recently posted a picture on his Instagram page with the caption, \u201cSavage Level Album coming soon.\u201d\n\nWe predict an amazing album release. Otile Brown has also hinted an album release with Tanzanian star Ali Kiba.\n\nControversy at it\u2019s best\n\nAs they say, controversy sells, and this year the showbiz scene will be full of controversial, scandalous and thought provoking moments.\n\nIt will be the year where clout chasers will use any means possible to remain relevant.\n\nDiana Marua aka Diana B and Bahati topped charts with controversies in the year that was, and it will not be any different this year.\n\nDespite working hard on his music, Willy Paul is quite controversial and we predict a stormier year for him.\n\nAs he continues to \u2018champion\u2019 for more local content in our broadcasting stations, clout chasing master Eric Omondi will pick up right from where he left at last year.\n\nCouples working more together\n\nFor some celebrity couples, mixing business and pleasure leads to great art and Mr Seed and his wife Mimo are a perfect example.\n\nTheir song Nafurahi gained more than half a million views on YouTube and we predict a more magical year for the couple.\n\nPower couple Nameless and Wahu also did well last year with their song Back It Up and we foresee more releases from them.\n\nDiana B is also a new entrant in the music scene and we predict collaboration with her hubby Bahati, probably not what we would want, but time will tell.", "articleBodyHtml": "<article>\n\n<figure><img src=\"https://www.pd.co.ke/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/Diana-Marua.jpg\" alt=\"\">\n<figcaption>\nDiana Marua.\n</figcaption></figure>\n\n<p><em>The year 2021 was a bumpy one for entertainment industry following the vagaries of Covid-19 pandemic.

Introducing coding skills prepares them at a young age to build for the future is crucial,\u201d she says.\n\nKaveke says coding has a number of benefits for the young minds.\n\n\u201cTo begin, children learn to solve problems. Children who learn to code acquire logical computational thinking and creative problem-solving skills, which include breaking issues down into little parts that are easier to manage before and during coding.\n\nChildren will need to solve problems at all phases of their development.

This is very grave, as public confidence in the courts is the bedrock of the rule of law.\n\nThere are too many unresolved charges of corruption and abuse of office facing very senior judges.\n\nThese charges are threatening the very fabric of the country\u2019s judicial system. Some have been dragging on for years.\n\nOne case of abuse of office and corruption is enough to undermine confidence in the entire Judiciary.\n\nIn 2018, Deputy chief Justice Philomena Mwilu was arrested on charges of corruption, failure to pay tax and improper dealings with Imperial Bank.\n\nAn attempt to make her step aside as her case was ongoing hit a brick wall after she successfully appealed against a court ruling ordering her to do so. She is still battling the charges against her.\n\nIn July 2021, two High Court judges, Aggrey Muchelule and Juma Chitembwe, were arrested after detectives raided their offices and found $50,000 (Sh5.6 million) in the former\u2019s chambers and recovered $7,000 (Sh789,000) from the latter\u2019s.\n\nThey were released on the same day, but soon filed a case against their arrest. The High Court ruled against their subsequent arrest until February 2022.\n\nBut even before the dust had settled, Justice Chitembwe was caught up in another corruption scandal.\n\nFormer Nairobi governor, Mike Sonko, released video tapes purportedly showing bribery negotiations with a representative of the Judge on cases he was hearing.\n\nThis time, the Judicial Service Commission (JSC), that is chaired by Chief Justice Martha Koome, summoned the Judge to defend himself.\n\nIn response, he moved to court to stop the JSC from hearing the case against him. In the meantime, three other petitioners filed petitions seeking his removal.\n\nIn October 2021, Gabriel van Straten, the sister to the late businessman, Tob Cohen, who was brutally murdered in his house in Nairobi, filed a petition seeking the removal of Judge Sankale ole Kantai, for alleged involvement in the death.\n\nA similar petition was filed by public interest litigator Okiya Omtata. The petitions said the judge had been linked to the death of Cohen through his supposed love affair with Cohen\u2019s widow Sarah Wairimu currently on trial over the death.\n\nJSC has asked the Judge to appear before it to respond to the petitions.\n\nAnd these are only the cases that have come to light. Unless Justice Koome deals quickly and decisively with these cases, her legacy risks being irredeemably stained.\n\nIt will take a lot of courage to deal with these matters. The accused judges have shown every indication they will go down with the ship if necessary.\n\nThe Judiciary must draw a line in the sand under what is now a full blown crisis of public confidence.\n\nThe matters continue to poison the Judiciary every day that they remain unresolved.\n\nWhat is even more disturbing is that the judges, despite these very grievous charges, continue to sit on the Bench, hearing cases of other accused.\n\nIn July 2019, Justice Mumbi Ngugi ruled that governors who had been charged with abuse of office must step aside until their cases were concluded.\n\nIn the spirit of that judgement by the same Judiciary, the judges facing these charges should have been required, nay, compelled, to step aside.\n\nKoome has some very tough calls to make. Ultimately, she will have to decide whether judges whose credibility is in tatters can continue serving on the Bench.\n\nFormer deputy Chief Justice Nancy Barasa, was forced out of office for much less by the very same JSC.\n\nIt\u2019s clear that something is terribly awry with the Judiciary. Kenya has found itself here before.\n\nThe country tackled this through a thorough vetting of all judges and magistrates.\n\nThe first was the radical surgery under President Mwai Kibaki, and the second was mandated by the 2010 Constitution on promulgation, through the Magistrates and Judges Vetting Board.\n\nFrom the web", "articleBodyHtml": "<article>\n\n<figure><img src=\"https://www.pd.co.ke/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/Chief-Justice-Martha-Koome.gif\" alt=\"\">\n<figcaption>\nChief Justice Martha Koome.

In the meantime, three other petitioners filed petitions seeking his removal.</p>\n\n<p>In October 2021, Gabriel van Straten, the sister to the late businessman, Tob Cohen, who was brutally murdered in his house in Nairobi, filed a petition seeking the removal of Judge Sankale ole Kantai, for alleged involvement in the death.</p>\n\n<p>A similar petition was filed by public interest litigator Okiya Omtata.\u00a0 The petitions said the judge had been linked to the death of Cohen through his supposed love affair with Cohen\u2019s widow Sarah Wairimu currently on trial over the death.</p>\n\n<p>JSC has asked the Judge to appear before it to respond to the petitions.</p>\n\n<p>And these are only the cases that have come to light. Unless Justice Koome deals quickly and decisively with these cases, her legacy risks being irredeemably stained.</p>\n\n<p>It will take a lot of courage to deal with these matters. The accused judges have shown\u00a0 every indication they will go down with the ship if necessary.</p>\n\n<p>The Judiciary must draw a line in the sand under what is now a full blown crisis of public confidence.</p>\n\n<p>The matters continue to poison the Judiciary every day that they remain unresolved.</p>\n\n<p>What is even more disturbing is that the judges, despite these very grievous charges, continue to sit on the Bench, hearing cases of other accused.</p>\n\n<p>In July 2019, Justice Mumbi Ngugi ruled that governors who had been charged with abuse of office must step aside until their cases were concluded.</p>\n\n<p>In the spirit of that judgement by the same Judiciary, the judges facing these charges should have been required, nay, compelled, to step aside.</p>\n\n<p>Koome has some very tough calls to make. Ultimately, she will have to decide whether judges whose credibility is in tatters can continue serving on the Bench.</p>\n\n<p>Former deputy Chief Justice Nancy Barasa, was forced out of office for much less by the very same JSC.</p>\n\n<p>It\u2019s clear that something is terribly awry with the Judiciary. Kenya has found itself here before.</p>\n\n<p>The country tackled this through a thorough vetting of all judges and magistrates.</p>\n\n<p>The first was the radical surgery under President Mwai Kibaki, and the second was mandated by the 2010 Constitution on promulgation, through the Magistrates and Judges Vetting Board.</p>\n\n<p><strong>From the web</strong></p>\n\n</article>", "canonicalUrl": "https://www.pd.co.ke/opinion/graft-charges-facing-judges-threat-to-koomes-legacy-108996/"},{"url": "https://www.pd.co.ke/lifestyle/i-set-my-son-free-to-explore-big-things-erastus-kwaka-omollo-reflects-on-his-sons-low-high-moments-in-life-109358/", "probability": 0.9897758, "headline": "I set my son free to explore big things \u2013 Erastus Kwaka Omollo reflects on his son\u2019s low, high moments in life", "datePublished": "2022-01-12T01:00:00+03:00", "datePublishedRaw": "2022-01-12T01:00:00+03:00", "dateModified": "2022-01-11T20:17:40+03:00", "dateModifiedRaw": "2022-01-11T20:17:40+03:00", "author": "Harriet James", "authorsList": ["Harriet James"], "inLanguage": "en", "mainImage": "https://www.pd.co.ke/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/Erastus-Kwaka-Omollo.jpg", "images": ["https://www.pd.co.ke/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/Erastus-Kwaka-Omollo.jpg"], "description": "Big Ted aka Thomas Kwaka, State House Deputy Director for Branding and Events is a big name in the events and entertainment industry.", "articleBody": "Big Ted aka Thomas Kwaka, State House Deputy Director for Branding and Events is a big name in the events and entertainment industry.\n\nHis father, Erastus Kwaka Omollo, an accountant, auditor, tax consultant and one of the partners at Crowe Erastus and Company Certified Public Accountants, a company that he founded 25 years ago, has nothing, but gratitude to God for his son.\n\nErastus, who is also a bishop at Voice of Salvation and Healing Church, Buru Buru recalls the day his son was born and what inspired him to name him Thomas.\n\n\u201cI gave him the name Thomas after an English missionary friend who has visted Kenya many years ago.\n\nHe was an aeronautical engineer and is one of the people who made the first planes in England and flew them.\n\nHe came to Kenya in the late 60s and we became great friends through a Christian fellowship, which we used to attend every month.\n\nWhen Ted was born, I decided to name him after my friend,\u201d he recalls.\n\nHis son and his friend had a lot in common now that he reflects on it. For instance, they are both big in size and while his friend loved to drive Range Rovers in the 70s, Big Ted loves such cars presently.\n\nThe two also are the first in many things and are risk takers. One of the most startling things is how fast Big Ted grew up, which Erastus claims characterises how ahead of things his son has been in his industry.\n\n\u201cBig Ted crawled briefly and one day, we just saw him running around the house.

I think that if he became an accountant he would have been a great one.\n\nHe admitted later that he did that to please me so he really wasn\u2019t into it,\u201d says Erastus who is a Certified Forensic Investigation Professional (CFIP) and a member of the Institute of Certified Public Accountants of Rwanda (ICPAR), Institute of Internal Auditors (IIA) and Kenya Institute of Management (KIM).\n\nAs painful as that was, Erastus allowed his son to experiment on what his heart\u2019s desires. However, he was shocked when he heard that his son had become a DJ.\n\nTo deal with the anxiety that came with this uncertainty, Erastus says that he prayed and trusted the process and the path that his son had taken.\n\nThen at one time, his son invited him to watch his performance at Kenyatta International Convention Centre (KICC).\n\n\u201cI liked what I saw him do. He was playing Christian songs so I was happy that it wasn\u2019t vulgar,\u201d he adds.\n\nErastus watched his son try out many ventures, such as starting a garbage collection company. He admired his son\u2019s entrepreneurial spirit and tried his best not to interfere.\n\nLater on, Big Ted sold the garbage collection company and concentrated more on events.\n\nBig Ted also attempted to be a stand-up comedian briefly, but not as a career. However, his father observed that being an MC suited him well.\n\nSo good was he at his job that in 2012, he was appointed as the State House Deputy Director for branding and events in 2012.\n\nWeighty issue\n\nAnother big moment that shocked Erastus was when Big Ted travelled to India for gastric bypass surgery after several attempts of losing weight in 2017.\n\n\u201cI found out through a WhatsApp message to his wife that he had gone to India and I nearly had a heart attack.\n\nI opted to wait for him to come back to give us an explanation. He told me that he knew I would oppose,\u201d he says.\n\nAfter the surgery, Erastus observes that his son has become more agile, because he is carrying less weight and he moves around faster. The veteran MC\u2019s weight dropped from 168 kilogrammes to 97 kilogrammes.\n\n\u201cHe had to cut off many things that he used to like, such as meat. I recall in the past how he would check whether I\u2019ve brought meat whenever I came home,\u201d he adds.\n\nAnother highlight was when Big Ted brought his wife, Sophie Gitonga, home in 2019.\n\nThe bishop recalls how elated he was that his son was finally settling. \u201cHe told me he wanted me to assure her of my support and that we don\u2019t follow or practice some of the strict Luo traditions.\n\nI assured her that we were different and above all, Christians,\u201d he recalls.\n\nWatching Big Ted raise his two children makes Erastus happy. His advice to parents is that they should allow their children to explore different career paths, but should ensure that they still guide them in the right path.\n\n\u201cUnless your child is doing something horrible, let them try out things until they fail, but don\u2019t stop advising - not quarreling, forcing or being judgmental.

said.</p>\n\n<p>It had earlier accused Kenya Power of failing to pay interest accrued on delayed payments of the bills owed to Kengen of upto Sh900 million, a matter Kenya Power said was beyond its control due to the Covid-19 pandemic.</p>\n\n<p>KenGen currently sells its generated electric energy to a single off-taker, Kenya Power.</p>\n\n<p>This comes with the attendant risk of late or delayed payment for electricity sales which could have adverse effects on the KenGen\u2019s cash flow and revenues.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Geothermal drilling</strong></p>\n\n<p>Meanwhile, the power producer said its revenue from geothermal drilling activities quadrupled in the year to June 2021 thanks to Ethiopia projects.</p>\n\n<p>\u201cEarnings from the new Ethiopian operations were up four times Sh440 million last year to Sh1.7 billion in the year ending June 2021, it said in the latest annual report.</p>\n\n<p>The Ethiopia ventures which include drilling in Tulu Moye in Ethiopia contributed revenues that surpassed the expenses.</p>\n\n<p>\u201cThe diversification venture that include drilling services in Tulu Moye in Ethiopia contributed additional revenue of Shs 1,784 million compared to Shs 440 million in the previous year,\u201d the statement said in part.</p>\n\n<p>The power producer said the costs associated with the drilling of wells in Tulu Moye were Sh1.3 billion.</p>\n\n<p>Ethiopia operations increased the costs of staff, plant operations, and maintenance as well as drilling.</p>\n\n<p>KenGen, which has for long faced the risk of having one customer, Kenya Power has been keen to diversify to drilling and other ventures to secure its cashflow.</p>\n\n<p>\u201cEmployee expenses increased by 8.5 per cent to Kes 7.6 billion due costs for staff engaged in the drilling operations in Ethiopia and implementation of Collective Bargaining Agreement (CBA), and gratuity for personnel on contract terms,\u201d KenGen said.</p>\n\n</article>", "canonicalUrl":

For a long time, I did not even understand the difference between a constituency and a candidate, but I must admit I was in good company.\n\nFast forward and President Daniel arap Moi wins the 1992 election and Jaramogi Oginga Odinga, who we all thought was going to win was placed a distant 4th after Moi, Kenneth Matiba and Mwai Kibaki. Reality sinks in, I get more curious and get immersed into politics.\n\nBut the drama does not end there because Moi wins and because he wants to consolidate clout in Parliament, we have these wave of defections and petitions all over, ostensibly to weaken opposition.\n\nKanu had 100 seats in Parliament while Matiba and Jaramogi both had 31 seats with Kibaki\u2019s DP garnering 26.\n\nPro Rashid Mzee is challenged in the in Kisauni by one Karisa Maitha, and a Raila led young Turks descend there and give the petitioner a second thorough beating.\n\nIn Migori Constituency, currently Suna East and Suna West, Charles Owino Likowa who won the 1992 General Election was forced by Kanu to defect from Ford Kenya and seek a fresh mandate on a Kanu ticket.\n\nThe campaigns are heated and even Jaramogi himself comes to Migori to drum up support for the Ford Kenya candidate; George Owino Achola. The race is tight between Likowa on a Kanu ticket and Achola of Ford Kenya.\n\nThe voting is peaceful but at the tallying centre, the powerful Kanu machinery is out to frustrate the will of the people of Migori.\n\nOut of nowhere, Raila forces himself against a thousand and one odds into the tallying centre at Migori Teachers Training College, protects the votes and Achola wins, the people of Migori are happy and Ford Kenya manages to pull the numbers and end up being the official opposition party.\n\nToday when I see promises by different political leaders, I ask myself whether they have what it takes to be that leader who fights for the masses.\n\nYou see, the 1992 young Turks of Gitobu Imanyara, Paul Muite, James Orengo, Kiraitu Murungi, Gibson Kamau Kuria, Dr Willy Mutunga, Raila and other luminaries of the second liberation like John Khaminwa, George Anyonya made a big difference under the tutelage of Jaramogi, Matiba and Masinde Muliro, and they can certainly lay claim to reform and public interest credentials.\n\nThat significant journey contributed a great deal to where Kenya is today and we wouldn\u2019t be here if these leaders and their contemporaries had not become.\n\nThey had to start the journey of being what they wanted to become: reformist.\n\nFast forward and in 2002 and Kibaki wins the presidency, we get the 2010 Constitution and Uhuru Kenyatta takes the reins of power.\n\nAnd the 2017 elections almost plunge the country in chaos with some calling for secession and Handshake happens.\n\nIt brings the much needed political tranquility that accelerates distributed grand infrastructure development all over the country.\n\nCritics have opined that the investments in infrastructure and the concerted war against graft have lowered the threshold of what the next leader has to do to change the lives of Kenyans.\n\nGiven these circumstances, it is safe to say that despite the political rhetoric, no politician can be that which he or she has not become. \u2014 [email protected]", "articleBodyHtml": "<article>\n\n<figure><img src=\"https://www.pd.co.ke/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/Former-Opposition-leader-Kenneth-Matiba.gif\" alt=\"\">\n<figcaption>\nFormer Opposition leader Kenneth Matiba who died in 2018.

Reality sinks in, I get more curious and get immersed into politics.</p>\n\n<p>But the drama does not end there because Moi wins and because he wants to consolidate clout in Parliament, we have these wave of defections and petitions all over, ostensibly to weaken opposition.</p>\n\n<p>Kanu had 100 seats in Parliament while Matiba and Jaramogi both had 31 seats with Kibaki\u2019s DP garnering 26.</p>\n\n<p>Pro Rashid Mzee is challenged in the in Kisauni by one Karisa Maitha, and a Raila led young Turks descend there and give the petitioner a second thorough beating.</p>\n\n<p>In Migori Constituency, currently Suna East and Suna West, Charles Owino Likowa who won the 1992 General Election was forced by Kanu to defect from Ford Kenya and seek a fresh mandate on a Kanu ticket.</p>\n\n<p>The campaigns are heated and even Jaramogi himself comes to Migori to drum up support for the Ford Kenya candidate; George Owino Achola. The race is tight between Likowa on a Kanu ticket and Achola of Ford Kenya.</p>\n\n<p>The voting is peaceful but at the tallying centre, the powerful Kanu machinery is out to frustrate the will of the people of Migori.</p>\n\n<p>Out of nowhere, Raila forces himself against a thousand and one odds into the tallying centre at Migori Teachers Training College, protects the votes and Achola wins, the people of Migori are happy and Ford Kenya manages to pull the numbers and end up being the official opposition party.</p>\n\n<p>Today when I see promises by different political leaders, I ask myself whether they have what it takes to be that leader who fights for the masses.</p>\n\n<p>You see, the 1992 young Turks of Gitobu Imanyara, Paul Muite, James Orengo, Kiraitu Murungi, Gibson Kamau Kuria, Dr Willy Mutunga, Raila and other luminaries of the second liberation like John Khaminwa, George Anyonya made a big difference under the tutelage of Jaramogi, Matiba and Masinde Muliro, and they can certainly lay claim to reform and public interest credentials.</p>\n\n<p>That significant journey contributed a great deal to where Kenya is today and we wouldn\u2019t be here if these leaders and their contemporaries had not become.</p>\n\n<p>They had to start the journey of being what they wanted to become: reformist.</p>\n\n<p>Fast forward and in 2002 and Kibaki wins the presidency, we get the 2010 Constitution and Uhuru Kenyatta takes the reins of power.</p>\n\n<p>And the 2017 elections almost plunge the country in chaos with some calling for secession and Handshake happens.</p>\n\n<p>It brings the much needed political tranquility that accelerates distributed grand infrastructure development all over the country.</p>\n\n<p>Critics have opined that the investments in infrastructure and the concerted war against graft have lowered the threshold of what the next leader has to do to change the lives of Kenyans.</p>\n\n<p>Given these circumstances, it is safe to say that despite the political rhetoric, no politician can be that which he or she has not become.\u00a0 <strong>\u2014 <a href=\"https://www.pd.co.ke/cdn-cgi/l/email-protection\" data-cfemail=\"0d65687e6f6263656c637e68634d6a606c6461236e6260\">[email\u00a0protected]</a></strong></p>\n\n</article>", "canonicalUrl": "https://www.pd.co.ke/opinion/why-politics-is-journey-of-a-thousand-miles-109082/"},{"url": "https://www.pd.co.ke/news/junet-explains-his-kisii-sentiment-blames-tanga-tanga-for-spreading-lies-100738/", "probability": 0.9932679, "headline": "Junet explains his Kisii sentiment, blames Tanga Tanga for spreading \u2018lies\u2019", "datePublished": "2021-10-26T07:05:18+03:00", "datePublishedRaw": "2021-10-26T07:05:18+03:00", "dateModified": "2021-10-26T07:05:22+03:00", "dateModifiedRaw": "2021-10-26T07:05:22+03:00", "author": "Evans Maritim", "authorsList": ["Evans Maritim"], "inLanguage": "en", "mainImage": "https://www.pd.co.ke/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/Minority-Whip-Junet-Mohammed.gif", "description": "He said his Tanga Tanga opponents took advantage of the sentiments to portray Raila as a regional leader.", "articleBody": "By , People Daily Digital\n| < 1 min read\n\nSuna East Member of Parliament Junet Mohammed stuck to what in he said in Nyamira last week.\n\nSpeaking on Citizen Television on Monday night, the MP said he was trying to excite the locals and his sentiments did not mean Raila Odinga's government would isolate other regions.\n\n\"What I said in Nyamira county has totally been blown out of context, been misinterpreted, misreported, misdirected.\n\n\"Campaigns are local and I was addressing the Gusii community.

Hamilton then locked up at the restart when on target for second.\n\nAs the dust began to settle on the banks of the Caspian Sea, Verstappen retained his slender four point lead in the drivers standings.\n\nHis team-mate Perez gained his first win since joining Red Bull and the second of his career.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m so happy for today.
