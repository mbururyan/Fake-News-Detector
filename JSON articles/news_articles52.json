his Mrs officially and while we are all happy for the blushing bride and groom", "articleBody": "Guardian Angel has finally married his Ether Musila making her his Mrs officially and while we are all happy for the blushing bride and groom who indeed make a handsome couple, I have to point out that she has some horrible advice for women when it comes to relationships and love.\n\nGuardian Angel\u2019s wife Esther Musila explains what makes a woman happy, and it\u2019s not money!\n\nShe took to her social media account to toast to her newfound marriage and love life as she boasted about her in-depth knowledge on what not only makes women more appealing to men but when you look at the nuance, how she managed to land a man as young as seemingly out of her reach as her husband.\n\nAndrew Kibe has spoken about the matter and he too took issue with Guardian Angel and he pointed out that this is a dead-end deal for the young man who in all honesty should not be too excited for the prospects of starting a family with his wife. But today I am more interested in what Esther Musila had to say.\n\nThat said, I do understand where Mrs Guardian Angel is coming from. She is a very rare example of a 50 year old single mother of 4 who has not only found love but has also been remarried. What is a more compelling lovetale than this? Well, it isn\u2019t exactly an inspiring love story when you account for the fact that she is clearly Guardian Angel\u2019s retirement plan. The gospel singer was a midling celebrity who wasn\u2019t really minting money from his talents. It is only natural for him to want to secure the bag and who can judge him?\n\nSo I have to ask, what do normal women who aren\u2019t in jobs that pay exceptionally well have to learn about love from a 50 year old woman dating a 30 year old man who has only upsides for wanting to engage himself in a relationship that he views as a job?\n\nAnyway, allow me to refocus on Esther Musila\u2019s words of romantic wisdom:\n\n\u201cThe happiest women today are not the married ones. They\u2019re not the single ones. They\u2019re not the ones with stable careers and good incomes.\u201d\n\nThis is an easily provable falsehood on two accounts: the first being that women are currently more liberated than they have ever been in the recorded history of the world and humanity but they score the lowest in terms of the self-reported happiness index and the percentage of women make up more than the percentage of men on antidepressants. In fact, this formed the basis of a very interesting research study done about the paradox of more female liberation coming hand in hand with more female depression.\n\nAlso, I should bring up the example of Google\u2019s VP, Sarah Kennedy Ellis who is currently going through it when it comes to having failed at running IVF in order to start a family with her husband. This is a woman who has conquered the tech world, has a great career but not being able to get babies is giving her depression. So clearly Esther Musila is only speaking anecdotally which should be disregarded.\n\n\u201cThe happiest women are the ones who made a choice to love themselves wholly and truly. Women who chose to leave the past behind, worked on their self-esteem and put a high price tag on their self-esteem.\u201d\n\nThis is called solipsism and it makes women horrible partners. How do we know this? Well, Just to keep Esther Musila informed, the most self-loving women are the women in the western world and guess what? Their marriage rates are dropping to some very disturbing rates. Relationships aren\u2019t about being self-centred. They are about sacrifice and realising that you and your spouse are together to actually start a family and generate wealth. Leaving the past behind as she puts it isn\u2019t running away from the consequences of your decisions.\n\n\u201c They stopped playing victims. They stopped whining in self-pity and dining in pity parties. They moved past their anger, tears and bitterness. They realized that happiness is a personal choice and responsibility. They chose to be defined by their present, but not their bitter pasts. \u201c\n\nI agree with this. Even I can admit when a broken clock gets something right.\n\n\u201c They are happy because they don\u2019t need validation from anyone. They are happy because they know that they don\u2019t need to throw shade on anyone for them to shine. They are happy because they chose to be Queens To the ladies in the house\u2026\u2026\u2026.. \u201c\n\nLast I checked, queens marry kings or are born to nobility. Men should be advised to avoid women with delusions of grandeur. That, however, still leaves the question of what makes relationships successful? The truth is, there are no one-size-fits all. However, it takes a lot of hard-work and compromise. It takes a lot of humility. Add to this the fact that women need men who are actual men. So unless you want to be the breadwinner who pays all the significant bills for your family including giving your husband an allowance/ stipend, do not listen to Mrs Guardian Angel.\n\nclick here.

In discussing Betty Kyallo and Lillian Muli\u2019s failed relationships, there will be nothing about a Kamba curse. This is first and foremost because ethnicity has no bearing on an individual\u2019s personality and secondly because I am not a superstitious lout who puts any thought towards curses and other nonsense.\n\nThat said, the two media personalities have a lot in common including their ethnicity. But what really binds them together is the fact that they are both modern women. As a result of this fact, they have both been married and failed at that. They are both now single mothers and both have had a string of ill-fated relationships that have not just ended in heartbreak but often times public scandal to boot.\n\nBetty Kyallo had announced that she was dating a city lawyer by the name of Nick Ndeda and the internets went wild. Every single, over 30, career driven woman was elated at the news. It meant that there was hope yet for her. The same thing happened when the Nairobian, Standard Group\u2019s tabloid ran stories about Lillian Muli dating Jared Nevaton, a shadowy businessman. These two women were held up as examples of there being love at the end of the tunnel.\n\nThe two ladies are clearly capable of finding love or it\u2019s cheap imitation. So if they can attract men, why can\u2019t they seem to keep any of these men? Well, there is no single answer to that question but rather a series of interesting answers. Let\u2019s get right into the whys and the wherefores.\n\n#1. Both Betty Kyallo and Lillian Muli are boss babes\n\nForget what your favourite vapid feminist influencer tells you, no man wants to date let alone marry a boss babe. Why? Because for some reason, this makes women insufferable. No man wants to have to deal with a woman who believes herself to be in competition with him. Sure, we want a woman who has the business savvy to run their enterprises or to pursue their career but the minute I have to start competing with you in the house then I want out. Men want women who will give them peace.\n\nProverbs 27:15\nA constant dripping on a day of steady rain\nAnd a contentious woman are alike;\n\n#2. They are famous so men want to be associated with them\n\nWhen they were younger, men saw them as trophies. The cherry ontop of their successful careers or businesses. Now that they are older, men still consider a romp with them as somewhat of an achievement. They figure that sleeping with such famous celebrities is worth more than your average bedpost notch. And as a result, their DMs will forever more be flooded by thirsty men looking for that cheap thrill till their sixties.\n\n#3. They conflate sexual desire with relationship desire\n\nBack to the second point; just because a man desires you sexually doesn\u2019t mean he desires a relationship wit you. This is sadly a lesson very few women in Nairobi seem to fully grasp. Simply because you have many men in your DMs doesn\u2019t mean any one of them would jump at the opportunity to wife you up. And getting the two conflated is the reason why Betty Kyallo and Lillian Muli have had such unfulfilling and shortlived relationships. I guarantee you that they already rue not cherishing their first marriages enough. I mean, sure, a lot of men want to take them on exotic destination vacations but that is only for as long as they excite their hormones. Once that novelty is worn out, its back to the streets for the two bitter media darlings.\n\n#4. Buggage\n\nDo you think that having been in loving relationships and failing at them doesn\u2019t make a person jaded? And don\u2019t you think jaded individuals carry that attitude like a chip on their shoulder into the next relationship? The two divorces between the pair is buggage enough. No man wants to be compared to their woman\u2019s past lovers. And no man wants to have to deal with famous men in his woman\u2019s list of lovers.\nAnd seeing how they both aired out their former partners and the fathers of their children, which man would be willing to risk such publicly played out drama? No man worth his salt, that\u2019s who.\n\n#5. They are single mothers\n\nI mean, show me a single man worth his salt who would choose to take on another man\u2019s children. Any man who knows he has options with women would not. And that is even when they have children of their own because life is simply not fair. No man wants to play part time dad to Denis Okari\u2019s now Jared Nevaton\u2019s child. So both Betty Kyallo and Lillian Muli find themselves hamstrung by this fact.\n\nI am sure there are plenty of reasons more but these are the ones that jumped me at a cursory glance. Feel free to add more or debate with yourself on whether or not I am wrong.\n\nin Opinions", "articleBodyHtml": "<article>\n\n<p>Right off the bat, allow me to admit that the title was tongue-in-cheek.

Yaani we have all seen Betty Kyallo struggle with being a wife. She failed at that when she allegedly stepped out on her man for a certain Coastal Sultan. Then there have been the other abortive relationships that have either been short-lived (one night stands that played out too long?) or were just a blend of personalities that had nothing to offer each other (certainly because one was even married at the onset of the relationship).\n\nHer most recent relationship is one that is beginning to look like it is going to put Betty Kyallo to shame because after everyone mocked it, the haters are once more vindicated as it looks like her and Nick Ndeda are no longer an item. Who would have thunk it?\n\nBetty Kyallo\u2019s weightloss journey: Women need to stop lying to each other\n\nLet us use the analogy of the fisherman. If I want to learn about fishing, for starters, I wouldn\u2019t be asking the fish now would I? I say this because men gatekeep relationships just as women gatekeep sex. I cannot ask a woman how to get chosen because every man\u2019s criteria is different and they determine who they get into relationships with. Simply put, whether or not a woman wants a relationship with a man, she cannot force him into one any more than a man can force himself on a woman. And clearly, Betty Kyallo has failed at the entire relationship thing.\n\nLet us use a second analogy. I will not ask the guard dog at the house that keeps being raided and robbed how to be a good guard dog. What am I supposed to learn from its failures at being a guard dog? I do not need a negative role model. The best part about this analogy is the understanding that dogs play different roles. Some dogs aren\u2019t meant to be guard dogs, they are meant to be pampered companions for people who have no need for a guard dog. Equally, our dear host with the most has shown us that she is not wife material but she too can play a role\u2026 Catch my drift?\n\nActor Lenana Kariba Confirms He Once Dated Betty Kyallo (Screenshot)\n\nAnd there is nothing wrong with that except when we take it into the context of her show on DSTV about how to be a wife, mother and guide to finding the wy to a man\u2019s heart. Like the pieces on a chess set, everyone needs to play their position and know their role. If you are a jump off, it is more authentic and pleasant for you to teach me how to be a jump off instead of trying to tell me how to be something else. But who am I to even dream of stopping Betty Kyallo from getting her bag? She has found executives and TV producers gullible enough to not realise just how ironic this endeavour is and they have backed her up with their wallets. She would have to be a fool not to take them for all their worth.\n\nin Opinions\n\nBetty Kyallo Nick Ndeda", "articleBodyHtml": "<article>\n\n<p>I was gobsmacked to learn that Betty Kyallo has a new show meant to teach women how to win and keep their men.

Then there have been the other abortive relationships that have either been short-lived (one night stands that played out too long?) or were just a blend of personalities that had nothing to offer each other (certainly because one was even married at the onset of the relationship).</p>\n\n<figure><a href=\"http://www.ghafla.com/ke/wp-content/uploads/sites/4/2022/01/WhatsApp-Image-2022-01-08-at-11.59.51-PM.jpeg\"><img src=\"http://www.ghafla.com/ke/wp-content/uploads/sites/4/2022/01/WhatsApp-Image-2022-01-08-at-11.59.51-PM.jpeg\" alt=\"\" srcset=\"http://www.ghafla.com/ke/wp-content/uploads/sites/4/2022/01/WhatsApp-Image-2022-01-08-at-11.59.51-PM.jpeg 1061w, http://www.ghafla.com/ke/wp-content/uploads/sites/4/2022/01/WhatsApp-Image-2022-01-08-at-11.59.51-PM-300x102.jpeg 300w, http://www.ghafla.com/ke/wp-content/uploads/sites/4/2022/01/WhatsApp-Image-2022-01-08-at-11.59.51-PM-1024x349.jpeg 1024w, http://www.ghafla.com/ke/wp-content/uploads/sites/4/2022/01/WhatsApp-Image-2022-01-08-at-11.59.51-PM-768x262.jpeg 768w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1061px) 100vw, 1061px\"></a></figure>\n\n<p>Her most recent relationship is one that is beginning to look like it is going to put Betty Kyallo to shame because after everyone mocked it, the haters are once more vindicated as it looks like her and Nick Ndeda are no longer an item. Who would have thunk it?</p>\n\n<h2><a href=\"http://www.ghafla.com/ke/betty-kyallo-weightloss-journey-women-need-to-stop-lying-to-each-other/\">Betty Kyallo\u2019s weightloss journey: Women need to stop lying to each other</a></h2>\n\n<p>Let us use the analogy of the fisherman. If I want to learn about fishing, for starters, I wouldn\u2019t be asking the fish now would I? I say this because men gatekeep relationships just as women gatekeep sex. I cannot ask a woman how to get chosen because every man\u2019s criteria is different and they determine who they get into relationships with. Simply put, whether or not a woman wants a relationship with a man, she cannot force him into one any more than a man can force himself on a woman. And clearly, Betty Kyallo has failed at the entire relationship thing.</p>\n\n<figure><a href=\"http://www.ghafla.com/ke/wp-content/uploads/sites/4/2021/11/572E2A30-4E51-4B45-B7CF-F28FC2B1A7AD.jpeg\"><img src=\"http://www.ghafla.com/ke/wp-content/uploads/sites/4/2021/11/572E2A30-4E51-4B45-B7CF-F28FC2B1A7AD.jpeg\" alt=\"\" srcset=\"http://www.ghafla.com/ke/wp-content/uploads/sites/4/2021/11/572E2A30-4E51-4B45-B7CF-F28FC2B1A7AD.jpeg 652w, http://www.ghafla.com/ke/wp-content/uploads/sites/4/2021/11/572E2A30-4E51-4B45-B7CF-F28FC2B1A7AD-300x217.jpeg 300w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 652px) 100vw, 652px\"></a><figcaption><p>Betty Kyallo with boyfriend, Nick Ndeda</p></figcaption></figure>\n\n<p>Let us use a second analogy. I will not ask the guard dog at the house that keeps being raided and robbed how to be a good guard dog. What am I supposed to learn from its failures at being a guard dog? I do not need a negative role model. The best part about this analogy is the understanding that dogs play different roles. Some dogs aren\u2019t meant to be guard dogs, they are meant to be pampered companions for people who have no need for a guard dog. Equally, our dear host with the most has shown us that she is not wife material but she too can play a role\u2026 Catch my drift?</p>\n\n<h2><a href=\"http://www.ghafla.com/ke/actor-lenana-kariba-confirms-he-once-dated-betty-kyallo-screenshot/\">Actor Lenana Kariba Confirms He Once Dated Betty Kyallo (Screenshot)</a></h2>\n\n<p>And there is nothing wrong with that except when we take it into the context of her show on DSTV about how to be a wife, mother and guide to finding the wy to a man\u2019s heart. Like the pieces on a chess set, everyone needs to play their position and know their role. If you are a jump off, it is more authentic and pleasant for you to teach me how to be a jump off instead of trying to tell me how to be something else. But who am I to even dream of stopping Betty Kyallo from getting her bag? She has found executives and TV producers gullible enough to not realise just how ironic this endeavour is and they have backed her up with their wallets. She would have to be a fool not to take them for all their worth.</p>\n\n<p><br></p>\n\n<p><strong><strong>in</strong> <a href=\"http://www.ghafla.com/ke/category/opinions/\">Opinions</a></strong></p>\n\n<p><a href=\"http://www.ghafla.com/ke/tag/betty-kyallo/\">Betty Kyallo</a><a href=\"http://www.ghafla.com/ke/tag/nick-ndeda/\">Nick Ndeda</a></p>\n\n</article>", "canonicalUrl": "http://www.ghafla.com/ke/the-audacity-betty-kyallos-show-teaches-you-about-how-to-get-and-keep-a-man/"},{"url": "http://www.ghafla.com/ke/andrew-kibe-reacts-to-huddah-selling-her-womb-for-millions-labda-elfu-tano/", "probability": 0.9815502, "headline": "Andrew Kibe Reacts To Huddah Selling Her Womb For Millions- \u2018Labda Elfu Tano\u2019", "datePublished": "2022-01-10T10:47:00", "datePublishedRaw": "January 10, 2022 at 10:47", "author": "Dennis Elnino", "authorsList": ["Dennis Elnino"], "inLanguage": "en", "mainImage": "http://www.ghafla.com/ke/andrew-kibe-reacts-to-huddah-selling-her-womb-for-millions-labda-elfu-tano/fully_qualified_image_url_here", "images": ["http://www.ghafla.com/ke/wp-content/uploads/sites/4/2021/12/WhatsApp-Image-2021-12-23-at-5.23.02-AM.jpeg", "http://www.ghafla.com/ke/wp-content/uploads/sites/4/2022/01/kibehudd.png"], "description": "There\u2019s no doubt that Huddah Monroe\u2019s value has immensely increased over the years.
