Justice (Rtd) Aaron Ringera, a former Kenya Anti-Corruption Commission boss.\n\nRingera will head the Caretaker Committee that has retired local football icons JJ Masiga and Bobby Ogolla as members.\n\nOther members of the committee are retired General Moses Oyugi, Fatma Adan, Philip Musyimi, Anthony Isayi, Elisha Kiplangat, Hassan Mahmoud Hajji, Fredrick Lekesike, Ali Amour, former FKF vice president Titus Kasuve, former Kenya Rugby Union bosses Mwangi Muthee and Richard Omwela, Kenya Police FC head coach John Bobby Ogolla, AFC Leopards legend JJ Masiga and Harambee Starlets forward Neddy Atieno.\n\nIn disbanding the FKF, CS Amina urged FIFA to help the government to clean up the mess in Kenya\u2019s football and not ban the country.\n\nHowever, FIFA responded to FKF\u2019s disbandment saying the decision to disband the management of federation places Kenya at risk of inviting a FIFA ban if the CS does not rescind her decision.\n\n\u201cIn case we consider the aforementioned decision by the Cabinet Secretary to appoint an FKF Caretaker Committee in lieu of the elected FKF Executive Committee is undoubtedly contrary to the above principles,\u201d FIFA said in a letter signed by chief member associations officer Kenny Jean-Marie.\n\n\u201cShould this be considered as undue government interference in the international affairs of the FKF, it could lead to a ban imposed on the FKF by the competent Fifa body.\n\n\u201cIn such a case, all of Kenyan football would suffer the consequences, and not just the individuals directly involved in the undue interference, in actuality, it is up to Fifa alone, on the basis of serious and well-founded information as well as under exceptional circumstances, to order the dismissal of executive bodies of member associations followed by the appointment of a normalization committee.\n\n\u201cTherefore, we kindly ask you to inform the Cabinet Secretary that in the event her decision to appoint an FKF Caretaker Committee and the correlated secretariat was to upheld, we would have no other choice than to submit the present matter to the Bureau of Fifa Council for consideration and decision.\u201d\n\nHowever, Fifa\u2019s has invited experts from different parties \u2013 FKF, Sports CS, and stakeholders for a roundtable meeting to discuss the matter and decide the way forward.\n\n\u201cFinally, and as referred to in the Cabinet Secretary\u2019s letter of October 18, 2021, we would like to emphasise our willingness to hold a meeting with the FKF and the Ministry of Sports as soon as possible so as to address any concerns both sides may have and, altogether, to decide on a way forward for Kenyan football,\u201d the letter concluded.", "articleBodyHtml":

committee \u00a0to run the federation\u2019s affairs.</p>\n\n<p>FIFA\u2019s statement come after Sports Cabinet Secretary Amina Mohamed on Thursday disbanded the football federation and appointed a 15-member Caretaker Committee led by Justice (Rtd) Aaron Ringera, a former Kenya Anti-Corruption Commission boss.</p>\n\n<p>Ringera will head the Caretaker Committee that has retired local football icons JJ Masiga and Bobby Ogolla as members.</p>\n\n<p>Other members of the committee are retired General Moses Oyugi, Fatma Adan, Philip Musyimi, Anthony Isayi, Elisha Kiplangat, Hassan Mahmoud Hajji, Fredrick Lekesike, Ali Amour, former FKF vice president Titus Kasuve, former Kenya Rugby Union bosses Mwangi Muthee and Richard Omwela, Kenya Police FC head coach John Bobby Ogolla, AFC Leopards legend JJ Masiga and Harambee Starlets forward Neddy Atieno.</p>\n\n<p>In disbanding the FKF, CS Amina urged FIFA to help the government to clean up the mess in Kenya\u2019s football and not ban the country.</p>\n\n<p>However, FIFA responded to FKF\u2019s disbandment saying the decision to disband the management of federation places Kenya at risk of inviting a FIFA ban if the CS does not rescind her decision.</p>\n\n<p>\u201cIn case we consider the aforementioned decision by the Cabinet Secretary to appoint an FKF Caretaker Committee in lieu of the elected FKF Executive Committee is undoubtedly contrary to the above principles,\u201d FIFA said in a letter signed by chief member associations officer Kenny Jean-Marie.</p>\n\n<p>\u201cShould this be considered as undue government interference in the international affairs of the FKF, it could lead to a ban imposed on the FKF by the competent Fifa body.</p>\n\n<p>\u201cIn such a case, all of Kenyan football would suffer the consequences, and not just the individuals directly involved in the undue interference, in actuality, it is up to Fifa alone, on the basis of serious and well-founded information as well as under exceptional circumstances, to order the dismissal of executive bodies of member associations followed by the appointment of a normalization committee.</p>\n\n<p>\u201cTherefore, we kindly ask you to inform the Cabinet Secretary that in the event her decision to appoint an FKF Caretaker Committee and the correlated secretariat was to upheld, we would have no other choice than to submit the present matter to the Bureau of Fifa Council for consideration and decision.\u201d</p>\n\n<p>However, Fifa\u2019s has invited experts from different parties \u2013 FKF, Sports CS, and stakeholders for a roundtable meeting to discuss the matter and decide the way forward.</p>\n\n<p>\u201cFinally, and as referred to in the Cabinet Secretary\u2019s letter of October 18, 2021, we would like to emphasise our willingness to hold a meeting with the FKF and the Ministry of Sports as soon as possible so as to address any concerns both sides may have and, altogether, to decide on a way forward for Kenyan football,\u201d the letter concluded.</p>\n\n</article>", "canonicalUrl": "https://enewskenya.com/fifa-reacts-to-fkfs-disbandment/"}]
