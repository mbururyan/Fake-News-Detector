They have especially been entrenched in the Kenyan transport infrastructure aside from serving as a source of employment and livelihood to many.\n\nSo, the question is, how true are the statistics tweeted by Gabriel Oguda about \u2018boda bodas\u2019 in Kenya?\n\nPesaCheck has examined all the four claims and found out the following:\n\nOn July 18, 2020, the National Transport and Safety Authority (NTSA) began registering all boda boda operators in Kenya in a move aimed at reducing accidents and curbing criminal activities involving motorbikes.\n\nThis suggests that there is no official database with details on the exact number of motorcycles in the boda boda business, as confirmed in a 2018 report by the National Crime Research Centre (NCRC) \u2014 a State Corporation under the Ministry of Interior and Coordination of National Government.\n\n\u201cThe National Transport and Safety Authority (NTSA) reported that there were 1,393,390 motorcycles registered in Kenya as at February 2018. However, the exact numbers of these motorcycles operating as \u2018boda bodas\u2019 in the country is not known and documented.\n\nThe lacuna in policy regarding the registration, regulation, monitoring and use of motorcycles in boda boda public service vehicle (PSV) transport is a cause for alarm,\u201d read the report.\n\nAnother report by the NCRC in 2019 recommended the establishment of a database of all boda boda operators in Kenya through mandatory registration, refresher training and testing.\n\nAccording to the Kenya National Bureau of Statistics\u2019 (KNBS) Economic Survey 2020 and 2015, the combined total of the number of registered motor and auto cycles over the last 10 years is 1,427,533. Both surveys make no mention of how many of these imported units are used as boda bodas.\n\nThe Motorcycle Assemblers Association of Kenya (MAAK) told PesaCheck in an email response it estimates that there are about 900,000 motorcycles in Kenya in the boda boda business.\n\nHowever, the figures by MAAK do not take into account those units that are directly imported into the country or those that are bought for personal use; rather, only those that are assembled locally.\n\nThe National Chairman of Boda Boda Safety Association of Kenya, Kevin Mubadi, told PesaCheck that there are 1.4 million boda bodas in Kenya. Again this is also an estimated figure, based on media reports and pronouncements by government officials.\n\n\u201cWe are rolling out massive registration to ensure that all of them are digitally registered,\u201d Mr Mubadi said. However, he did not give a timeline on when this would be conducted.\n\nAccording to UNLEASH, a non-profit founded in 2016, the boda boda sector employs over 1.2 million youth.\n\nBased on the available evidence, the claim that there are 500,000 motorcycles in the boda boda business is therefore MOSTLY FALSE.\n\nClaim 2: There are 76, 000 unregistered operators in Nairobi alone.\n\nVerdict \u2014 INCONCLUSIVE\n\nThe 2018 report by the NCRC pointed out that the issue of unregistered motorcycles is one of the major impediments to addressing the issue of run-away crime plaguing the sub-sector.\n\nAnother report carried on CitizenTV in 2019, claimed an estimated 45,000 motorcycles that year were waiting for number plates but were already in use. The report attributed the figures to Motorcycle Assemblers of Kenya Chairman Isaac Kalua.\n\nBut apart from speculative news reports, there are no definitive figures about unregistered motorcycles making the claim INCONCLUSIVE.\n\nThe 2020 Economic Survey by the KNBS shows that newly registered motorcycles numbered 210,103 units in 2019. This works out to about 17,508 units per month.\n\nThe monthly average of the same for the preceding year (2018) was 15,749 and the year before that (2017) stood at 15,536.\n\nBased on the annual figures of newly registered motorcycles between 2017 to 2019, the monthly average number of motorcycle units imported over the past three years works out to about 16,264.\n\nSo the claim that 16,500 motorcycle units are imported every month largely holds true.\n\nMagdaline Karigu, an official at the Motorcycle Assemblers Association of Kenya (MAAK), also told PesaCheck in an email that currently, an average of 18,000 motorcycles are registered monthly in Kenya.\n\nThe available evidence, therefore, makes the claim that 16,500 motorcycle units are imported every month MOSTLY TRUE.\n\nClaim 4: 1,075 people already died from \u2018boda boda\u2019 accidents in 2020 alone with 301 of those being pillion passengers and 774 being motorcyclists.\n\nVerdict \u2014 TRUE\n\nThe figures mentioned in the claim are taken from a statement released by NTSA dated October 9, 2020, and which was published jointly with the National Police Service.\n\nIn the latest figures released on November 11, 2020, the NTSA said that 884 motorcyclists and 350 pillion passengers died from \u2018boda boda\u2019 accidents bringing the total fatalities to 1,244.\n\nGiven that the claim in question was posted on October 18, it is therefore TRUE.", "articleBodyHtml": "<article>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://archive.vn/N73tA\">Gabriel Oguda</a> claimed there are 500,000 motorcycles in the \u2018boda boda\u2019 business, with 16,500 units imported every month, and 76,000 unregistered operators in Nairobi alone.</p>\n\n<p>Mr Oguda further claimed 1,075 people died from boda boda accidents in 2020 alone \u2014 301 pillion passengers (a passenger that sits behind the rider on a motorbike) and 774 motorcyclists.</p>\n\n<p>However, the source of these statistics was not quoted, despite a query from one of the users who responded to Mr Oguda\u2019s tweet.</p>\n\n<p>\u2018Boda bodas\u2019 are two-wheeler commercial motorcycles that have become a popular mode of transport both in the Kenyan rural areas and urban sprawls, moving people and goods from one place to another.

However, the exact numbers of these motorcycles operating as \u2018boda bodas\u2019 in the country is not known and documented.</p>\n\n<p>The lacuna in policy regarding the registration, regulation, monitoring and use of motorcycles in boda boda public service vehicle (PSV) transport is a cause for alarm,\u201d read the report.</p>\n\n<p>Another report by the NCRC in 2019 <a href=\"https://dc.sourceafrica.net/documents/120841-Infographics-Boda-Boda-Motocycle-Crimes-in-Kenya.html\">recommended</a> the establishment of a database of all boda boda operators in Kenya through mandatory registration, refresher training and testing.</p>\n\n<p>According to the Kenya National Bureau of Statistics\u2019 (KNBS) Economic Survey <a href=\"https://dc.sourceafrica.net/documents/120842-Economic-Survey-2020.html\">2020</a> and <a href=\"https://dc.sourceafrica.net/documents/120843-Kenya-Economic-Survey-2015.html\">2015</a>, the combined total of the number of registered motor and auto cycles over the last 10 years is 1,427,533. Both surveys make no mention of how many of these imported units are used as boda bodas.</p>\n\n<p>The Motorcycle Assemblers Association of Kenya (MAAK) told PesaCheck in an email response it estimates that there are about 900,000 motorcycles in Kenya in the boda boda business.</p>\n\n<p>However, the figures by MAAK do not take into account those units that are directly imported into the country or those that are bought for personal use; rather, only those that are assembled locally.</p>\n\n<p>The National Chairman of Boda Boda Safety Association of Kenya, Kevin Mubadi, told PesaCheck that there are 1.4 million boda bodas in Kenya. Again this is also an estimated figure, based on media reports and pronouncements by government officials.</p>\n\n<p>\u201cWe are rolling out massive registration to ensure that all of them are digitally registered,\u201d Mr Mubadi said. However, he did not give a timeline on when this would be conducted.</p>\n\n<p>According to UNLEASH, a non-profit founded in 2016, the boda boda sector employs over<a href=\"https://unleash.org/solutions/boda-bora/\"> 1.2 million youth</a>.</p>\n\n<p>Based on the available evidence, the claim that there are 500,000 motorcycles in the boda boda business is therefore MOSTLY FALSE.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Claim 2:</strong> <strong>There are</strong> <strong>76, 000 unregistered operators in Nairobi alone.</strong></p>\n\n<p><strong>Verdict \u2014 INCONCLUSIVE</strong></p>\n\n<p>The 2018 report by the NCRC pointed out that the issue of <a href=\"https://dc.sourceafrica.net/documents/120840-Report-on-Boda-Boda-Motorcycle-Transport-and.html\">unregistered motorcycles </a>is one of the major impediments to addressing the issue of run-away crime plaguing the sub-sector.</p>\n\n<p>Another <a href=\"https://citizentv.co.ke/news/revealed-45000-motorcycles-operating-without-number-plates-229487/\">report</a> carried on <em>CitizenTV</em> in 2019, claimed an estimated 45,000 motorcycles that year were waiting for number plates but were already in use.

The publisher drives organisational strategy, and partnerships. The newsroom is led by a managing editor, who is the senior editorial decision-maker and who is responsible for shaping editorial priorities and signing-off on all fact-checks before publication. The managing editor is assisted by three deputy editors; a news editor who manages the NewsDesk and in-country researchers/fact-checkers across the continent; a chief copy editor who manages the multilingual CopyDesk that uses a three-step process to check all fact-checks for factual accuracy and grammatical correctness; and a special projects editor who oversees PesaCheck\u2019s digital innovations including our DebunkBot, PromiseTracker, PesaYetu and TaxClock toolkits.\n\nThe editors are supported by deputies (including Francophone and Amharic language team coordinators), as well as newsdesk-based specialist data analysts/researchers.\n\nThe PesaCheck newsdesk receives additional support from CfA\u2019s wider data journalism and infographic design teams, as well as its digital engagement (social media and multimedia) team. And, PesaCheck works closely with CfA\u2019s Academy to help mentor and train other newsrooms or civic watchdogs.\n\nOur researchers\n\nPesaCheck\u2019s editorial team is composed of fact-checkers who have extensive journalistic experience, or who are research specialists in topics such as economics, public finances or development issues.\n\nOur fact-checkers are always locally based, in the 12 countries we report from, in Burkina Faso, Burundi, Cameroon, Central African Republic, C\u00f4te d\u2019Ivoire, Ethiopia, Guinea, Kenya, Mali, Niger, Tanzania and Uganda. We also run a Francophone regional support hub in Senegal.\n\nThe fact-checkers regularly collaborate on regional verification projects, tackling cross-cutting thematic issues such as the COVID-19 health emergency, or assisting each other as part of \u2018rapid response teams\u2019 during civil wars/conflicts/coups and during the run-up/polling during elections.\n\nPesaCheck occasionally appoints additional specialists, as short-term \u2018fellows\u2019 or associates, to drive specific projects such as our research into persistent conspiracy theories on YouTube or the spread of toxic speech (such as racist incitement and other hate speech) on WhatsApp.\n\nPesaCheck\u2019s fact-checkers focus on verifying the accuracy and meaning of the actual content in mis-/disinformation claims. Another CfA initiative, the iLAB at ANCIR, uses data science and forensic investigation to probe the \u2018hidden hand\u2019 networks and digital techniques used to make misleading content go viral. PesaCheck often collaborates with the iLAB and another CfA incubated initiative, the Digital Forensic Labs (DFRLab) Africa team, to expose large-scale coordinated inauthentic behaviour (CiB) and influence operations.\n\nMore information on the core PesaCheck team can be found here.\n\nOur sources\n\nThere is a lot of mis-/disinformation and other misleading content out there. This includes claims by public figures and pundits at public events and in the mainstream media (in print media, or on TV and radio, and on their online outlets), as well as on government or political party websites, on social media (including on chat platforms such as WhatsApp) or blogging and multimedia sites such as YouTube.\n\nPesaCheck believes it is important to apply a consistent set of criteria for determining eligibility for us to fact-check public claims, so that we can be consistently even-handed in our approach.\n\nWe also collect requests from the public on claims that need checking using this online form.\n\nAs a requirement for all our fact-checks, we include multiple sources of information and references. This helps to underline the veracity of our arguments. In addition, the sources are referenced accurately. To do this, we use sourceAFRICA, a repository of actionable documents.\n\nThrough sourceAFRICA, the PesaCheck team can:\n\nArchive the source documents for future reference\nAnnotate the specific page where the information is sourced from. As newspapers do not use complete references like academic papers, hyperlinks would serve to highlight the references. It also allows the readers an opportunity to review the document in its entirety.\n\nEvery source document that is referenced in a story is saved on sourceAFRICA in order to preserve a copy and link directly to the information being referenced.\n\nAll sources and facts to be checked will be recorded on Check, where fact-check requests crowdsourced from the public and from social media will be managed and updated as they progress.\n\nWe put a premium on story ideas generated by members of the public, as this indicates that the issue is of great public importance, and it is a good source of information that may not yet be in the public eye.\n\nTo underline the credibility of PesaCheck stories, we ensure that our sources are quoted comprehensively \u2014 full name and designation.\n\nAny information from sources that seek anonymity is treated as background information only. Such information must be corroborated by evidence.\n\nPesaCheck is committed to disclosing to its readers the sources of the information in its stories to the maximum possible extent. We want to make our reporting as transparent to the readers as possible so they may know how and where we got our information. Transparency is honest and fair, two values we cherish.\n\nIdentifying claims to be checked\n\nNot all statements are created equal. Here are some criteria that we use to help establish a hierarchy of important statements to fact-check:\n\nMembers of the public can also suggest claims to be fact-checked, by emailing us at [email protected] or reach the news editor at [email protected] They can also WhatsApp out tipline: +254754999992. If claims from the public meet the public interest criteria, they\u2019ll be looked into, and feedback provided on the channel it was shared.\n\nFact-checking guidelines\n\nWe have three main rules guiding our fact-checking process:\n\nGolden Rule 1: Only one fact per fact-check. We limit each fact check to one statement only, or a set of statements that are clearly related.\nGolden Rule 2: Check every fact check. We do our best to corroborate the fact/verification. For example, rather than using a newspaper story about the budget; we use the budget document to fact check a statement.\nGolden Rule 3: Draw a conclusion based on the facts. After all the research, corroboration and interviews, we assign a label to the fact check: True, Partially True, Untrue, Partially Untrue, or Inconclusive.\n\nWe use this checklist to write and prepare our fact-checks:\n\nIs the statement being checked included verbatim?\nIs there an explainer for why this statement was selected for checking?\nHas the category of deception been identified?\nHave all the sources for the fact being checked been identified?\nAny source documents used in the fact check need to be annotated and uploaded to sourceAfrica, including any additional useful data identified in the process of fact-checking.\nHas the reason for the labeling the statement True, Not True, etc been indicated?\nIs the label (true, not true etc) mentioned briefly at the top of the story, and in more detail at the end of the story?\nHave any links to the sources and the statement being checked been included in the body of the article?\n\nFinal editing checklist\n\nWe use the following final editing checklist based in part on the PolitiFact checklist:\n\n1. Is the claim open to interpretation? Is there another way to read the claim?\n\n2. Is the rating fair and consistent with other fact checks?\n\n3. Is the rating supported by all available facts? Do questions linger?\n\nSocial media policy\n\nSocial media is a key tool that we use to distribute our fact-checks. The following are guidelines that we use to keep our social media consistent and harmonised.\n\nWe don\u2019t post anything that we cannot stand by.\nAll posts follow a consistent structure \u2014 a question statement (what), a source (who) and a link to the story (where to find more).\nExample: FACT CHECK: Did @Kandie_Phyllis misspeak about pledging Sh18bn for disabled kids? @PesaCheck finds out: p://bit.ly/2aIxrqa\nEach fact check needs a standard hashtag, for example #PesaCheck\nAll reactions and comments are looked into, especially when they lead to potential follow-up stories that may arise out of the fact check.\n\nCorrections policy\n\nTransparency is a core value for PesaCheck, and we strive for accurate and comprehensive fact-checking. We all make mistakes sometimes, and while every error is a weakness, some errors are inevitable, and we are fully open to correcting them promptly in whatever material we publish on our platforms.\n\nWhen we run a correction, clarification or editor\u2019s note, our goal is to tell readers, as clearly and quickly as possible, what was wrong and what is correct. Anyone should be able to understand how and why a mistake has been corrected.\n\nIt is necessary to use a correction, clarification or editor\u2019s note to inform readers whenever we correct a significant mistake.\n\nUpdates are used to reflect important new information or clarifications; corrections are for mistakes.\n\nClarification\n\nWhen the content is factually correct but the language used to explain the facts is not as clear or detailed as it should be, the post will be rewritten and a clarification added to the story. A clarification can also be used to note that we initially failed to seek a comment or response that has since been added to the story.\n\nEditor\u2019s notes\n\nA correction that calls into question the entire substance of an article, raises a significant ethical matter or addresses whether an article did not meet our standards, may require an Editor\u2019s Note and be followed by an explanation of what is at issue.\n\nTherefore:\n\nWhen an error is brought to our attention, we will indicate in comments that it has been corrected.\nAny erroneous information published on our social platforms will be corrected on any and all platforms it was published on.\nWe do not attribute blame to individuals, but we may note that an error was the result of incorrect information from a trusted source.\n\nTake-down (unpublish) requests\n\nAs a matter of editorial policy, we do not grant take-down requests. If the subject claims that the story was inaccurate, we are prepared to investigate and, if necessary, publish a correction.\n\nStories will be updated if we checked a claim and drew a conclusion based on facts available at the time, but there is significant new information that will warrant a change in that conclusion.\n\nIn short, our response will be to consider whether further action is warranted, but not to remove the article as though it had never been published.\n\nRight of reply\n\nPersons who are the subject of a fact-check get a reasonable opportunity to respond to us.\n\nAttribution\n\nWe strive to be truthful about the source of our information. Facts and quotations in a story that were not produced by our own reporting need an attribution. Attribution of material from other media must be total. Plagiarism is not permitted.\n\nWe place a premium value on original reporting.", "articleBodyHtml": "<article>\n\n<p>PesaCheck is headed by a <strong>publisher</strong>, who is also CfA\u2019s chief executive officer (and co-founder).

And, PesaCheck works closely with CfA\u2019s Academy to help mentor and train other newsrooms or civic watchdogs.</p>\n\n<figure><img alt=\"\" src=\"https://miro.medium.com/max/1400/1*e2qu05_tGDLMGHtIu_d6gw.png\"><figcaption>An overview of the roles in PesaCheck\u2019s newsroom</figcaption></figure>\n\n<h2>Our researchers</h2>\n\n<p>PesaCheck\u2019s editorial team is composed of fact-checkers who have extensive journalistic experience, or who are research specialists in topics such as economics, public finances or development issues.</p>\n\n<p>Our fact-checkers are always locally based, in the 12 countries we report from, in Burkina Faso, Burundi, Cameroon, Central African Republic, C\u00f4te d\u2019Ivoire, Ethiopia, Guinea, Kenya, Mali, Niger, Tanzania and Uganda. We also run a Francophone regional support hub in Senegal.</p>\n\n<figure><img alt=\"\" src=\"https://miro.medium.com/max/60/1*t-9Xx_pKTnkLMVShVlk20Q.jpeg?q=20\"></figure>\n\n<p>The fact-checkers regularly collaborate on regional verification projects, tackling cross-cutting thematic issues such as the COVID-19 health emergency, or assisting each other as part of \u2018rapid response teams\u2019 during civil wars/conflicts/coups and during the run-up/polling during elections.</p>\n\n<p>PesaCheck occasionally appoints additional specialists, as short-term \u2018fellows\u2019 or associates, to drive specific projects such as our research into persistent conspiracy theories on YouTube or the spread of toxic speech (such as racist incitement and other hate speech) on WhatsApp.</p>\n\n<p>PesaCheck\u2019s fact-checkers focus on verifying the accuracy and meaning of the actual content in mis-/disinformation claims. Another CfA initiative, the <a href=\"https://investigate.africa/ilab-reports/\"><strong>iLAB</strong></a> at ANCIR, uses data science and forensic investigation to probe the \u2018hidden hand\u2019 networks and digital techniques used to make misleading content go viral. PesaCheck often collaborates with the iLAB and another CfA incubated initiative, the <a href=\"https://medium.com/dfrlab\"><strong>Digital Forensic Labs</strong></a> (DFRLab) Africa team, to expose large-scale coordinated inauthentic behaviour (CiB) and influence operations.</p>\n\n<p>More information on the core PesaCheck team can be found <a href=\"https://pesacheck.org/about\">here</a>.</p>\n\n<h2>Our sources</h2>\n\n<p>There is a <strong><em>lot</em></strong> of mis-/disinformation and other misleading content out there. This includes claims by public figures and pundits at public events and in the mainstream media (in print media, or on TV and radio, and on their online outlets), as well as on government or political party websites, on social media (including on chat platforms such as WhatsApp) or blogging and multimedia sites such as YouTube.</p>\n\n<p>PesaCheck believes it is important to apply a consistent set of criteria for determining eligibility for us to fact-check public claims, so that we can be consistently even-handed in our approach.</p>\n\n<p>We also collect requests from the public on claims that need checking using <a href=\"https://docs.google.com/forms/d/1TBOZ3o0cauIHIl-rQStrenTvx0OWmw0RicOgxnzd7CI/edit\">this online form</a>.</p>\n\n<p>As a requirement for all our fact-checks, we include multiple sources of information and references. This helps to underline the veracity of our arguments. In addition, the sources are referenced accurately. To do this, we use<a href=\"https://sourceafrica.net/\"> sourceAFRICA,</a> a repository of actionable documents.</p>\n\n<p>Through sourceAFRICA, the PesaCheck team can:</p>\n\n<ul><li><strong>Archive</strong> the source documents for future reference</li><li><strong>Annotate</strong> the specific page where the information is sourced from. As newspapers do not use complete references like academic papers, hyperlinks would serve to highlight the references. It also allows the readers an opportunity to review the document in its entirety.</li></ul>\n\n<p>Every source document that is referenced in a story is saved on <a href=\"https://sourceafrica.net\">sourceAFRICA</a> in order to preserve a copy and link directly to the information being referenced.</p>\n\n<p>All sources and facts to be checked will be recorded on <a href=\"http://checkmedia.org\">Check</a>, where fact-check requests crowdsourced from the public and from social media will be managed and updated as they progress.</p>\n\n<p>We put a premium on story ideas generated by members of the public, as this indicates that the issue is of great public importance, and it is a good source of information that may not yet be in the public eye.</p>\n\n<p>To underline the credibility of PesaCheck stories, we ensure that our sources are quoted comprehensively \u2014 full name and designation.</p>\n\n<p>Any information from sources that seek anonymity is treated as background information only. Such information must be corroborated by evidence.</p>\n\n<p>PesaCheck is committed to disclosing to its readers the sources of the information in its stories to the maximum possible extent. We want to make our reporting as transparent to the readers as possible so they may know how and where we got our information. Transparency is honest and fair, two values we cherish.</p>\n\n<h2>Identifying claims to be checked</h2>\n\n<p>Not all statements are created equal. Here are some criteria that we use to help establish a hierarchy of important statements to fact-check:</p>\n\n<p>Members of the public can also suggest claims to be fact-checked, by emailing us at <a href=\"https://pesacheck.org/cdn-cgi/l/email-protection\" data-cfemail=\"59313c35353619293c2a383a313c3a3277362b3e\">[email\u00a0protected]</a> or reach the news editor at <a href=\"https://pesacheck.org/cdn-cgi/l/email-protection\" data-cfemail=\"fa9e95889f9f94ba8a9f899b99929f9991d495889dd4\">[email\u00a0protected]</a> They can also WhatsApp out tipline: +254754999992. If claims from the public meet the public interest criteria, they\u2019ll be looked into, and feedback provided on the channel it was shared.</p>\n\n<h2><strong>Fact-checking guidelines</strong></h2>\n\n<p>We have three main rules guiding our fact-checking process:</p>\n\n<ul><li><strong>Golden Rule 1: Only one fact per fact-check. </strong>We limit each fact check to one statement only, or a set of statements that are clearly related.</li><li><strong>Golden Rule 2: Check every fact check. </strong>We do our best to corroborate the fact/verification. For example, rather than using a newspaper story about the budget; we use the budget document to fact check a statement.</li><li><strong>Golden Rule 3: Draw a conclusion based on the facts. </strong>After all the research, corroboration and interviews, we assign a label to the fact check: <strong>True, Partially True, Untrue, Partially Untrue, </strong>or <strong>Inconclusive</strong>.</li></ul>\n\n<p>We use this <strong>checklist </strong>to write and prepare our fact-checks:</p>\n\n<ol><li>Is the statement being checked included verbatim?</li><li>Is there an explainer for why this statement was selected for checking?</li><li>Has the category of deception been identified?</li><li>Have all the sources for the fact being checked been identified? <br>Any source documents used in the fact check need to be annotated and uploaded to <a href=\"https://sourceafrica.net/\">sourceAfrica</a>, including any additional useful data identified in the process of fact-checking.</li><li>Has the reason for the labeling the statement True, Not True, etc been indicated?</li><li>Is the label (true, not true etc) mentioned briefly at the top of the story, and in more detail at the end of the story?</li><li>Have any links to the sources and the statement being checked been included in the body of the article?</li></ol>\n\n<h2><strong>Final editing checklist</strong></h2>\n\n<p>We use the following <strong>final editing checklist</strong> based in part on the <a href=\"https://www.factcheck.org/our-process/\">PolitiFact checklist</a>:</p>\n\n<p>1. Is the claim open to interpretation? Is there another way to read the claim?</p>\n\n<p>2. Is the rating fair and consistent with other fact checks?</p>\n\n<p>3. Is the rating supported by all available facts? Do questions linger?</p>\n\n<h2><strong>Social media policy</strong></h2>\n\n<p>Social media is a key tool that we use to distribute our fact-checks. The following are guidelines that we use to keep our social media consistent and harmonised.</p>\n\n<ol><li>We don\u2019t post anything that we cannot stand by.</li><li>All posts follow a consistent structure \u2014 a question statement (what), a source (who) and a link to the story (where to find more). <br>Example: <strong>FACT CHECK: Did</strong><a href=\"https://twitter.com/Kandie_Phyllis\"><strong> @Kandie_Phyllis</strong></a><strong> misspeak about pledging Sh18bn for disabled kids?</strong><a href=\"https://twitter.com/PesaCheck\"><strong> @PesaCheck</strong></a><strong> finds out: </strong><a href=\"https://t.co/385A4LbHhl\"><strong>p://bit.ly/2aIxrqa</strong></a></li><li>Each fact check needs a standard hashtag, for example <a href=\"https://twitter.com/hashtag/PesaCheck?src=hash\">#PesaCheck</a></li><li>All reactions and comments are looked into, especially when they lead to potential follow-up stories that may arise out of the fact check.</li></ol>\n\n<h2>Corrections policy</h2>\n\n<p>Transparency is a core value for PesaCheck, and we strive for accurate and comprehensive fact-checking. We all make mistakes sometimes, and while every error is a weakness, some errors are inevitable, and we are fully open to correcting them promptly in whatever material we publish on our platforms.</p>\n\n<p>When we run a correction, clarification or editor\u2019s note, our goal is to tell readers, as clearly and quickly as possible, what was wrong and what is correct. Anyone should be able to understand how and why a mistake has been corrected.</p>\n\n<p>It is necessary to use a correction, clarification or editor\u2019s note to inform readers whenever we correct a significant mistake.</p>\n\n<p>Updates are used to reflect important new information or clarifications; corrections are for mistakes.</p>\n\n<h3>Clarification</h3>\n\n<p>When the content is factually correct but the language used to explain the facts is not as clear or detailed as it should be, the post will be rewritten and a clarification added to the story. A clarification can also be used to note that we initially failed to seek a comment or response that has since been added to the story.</p>\n\n<h3>Editor\u2019s notes</h3>\n\n<p>A correction that calls into question the entire substance of an article, raises a significant ethical matter or addresses whether an article did not meet our standards, may require an Editor\u2019s Note and be followed by an explanation of what is at issue.</p>\n\n<p>Therefore:</p>\n\n<ol><li>When an error is brought to our attention, we will indicate in comments that it has been corrected.</li><li>Any erroneous information published on our social platforms will be corrected on any and all platforms it was published on.</li><li>We do not attribute blame to individuals, but we may note that an error was the result of incorrect information from a trusted source.</li></ol>\n\n<h2>Take-down (unpublish) requests</h2>\n\n<p>As a matter of editorial policy, we do not grant take-down requests. If the subject claims that the story was inaccurate, we are prepared to investigate and, if necessary, publish a correction.</p>\n\n<p>Stories will be updated if we checked a claim and drew a conclusion based on facts available at the time, but there is <strong>significant </strong>new information that will warrant a change in that conclusion.</p>\n\n<p>In short, our response will be to consider whether further action is warranted, but not to remove the article as though it had never been published.</p>\n\n<h2>Right of reply</h2>\n\n<p>Persons who are the subject of a fact-check get a reasonable opportunity to respond to us.</p>\n\n<h2>Attribution</h2>\n\n<p>We strive to be truthful about the source of our information. Facts and quotations in a story that were not produced by our own reporting need an attribution. Attribution of material from other media must be total. Plagiarism is not permitted.</p>\n\n<p>We place a premium value on original reporting.</p>\n\n<figure><img alt=\"\" src=\"https://miro.medium.com/max/60/1*IfdsF3Mdjtu2ajo23QJs5g.png?q=20\"></figure>\n\n</article>", "canonicalUrl": "https://pesacheck.org/our-methodology-f3d77521a1ee"},{"url": "https://pesacheck.org/altered-this-image-of-fighters-with-the-oromo-liberation-flag-is-doctored-8afb1fa30a29?source=rss----ab41f21aa9a9---4&gi=78479b97e40e", "probability": 0.8722022, "headline": "ALTERED: This image of fighters with the Oromo Liberation flag is doctored", "datePublished": "2021-12-14T13:00:32.654000+00:00", "datePublishedRaw": "2021-12-14T13:00:32.654Z", "dateModified": "2021-12-14T13:00:36.760000+00:00", "dateModifiedRaw": "2021-12-14T13:00:36.760Z", "author": "PesaCheck", "authorsList": ["PesaCheck"], "inLanguage": "en", "mainImage": "https://miro.medium.com/max/800/1*Bt6veCM22ND0Z4ZT8tvtKg.png", "images": ["https://miro.medium.com/max/60/0*iCBWmUlaWlaDgLbe?q=20", "https://miro.medium.com/max/1400/1*Bt6veCM22ND0Z4ZT8tvtKg.png", "https://miro.medium.com/max/54/0*DUs44bkJoksncmlS?q=20", "https://miro.medium.com/max/400/0*8RhpDRl-gug3G1mG"], "description": "The original image shows Somali Al Shabaab fighters gathering in February 2012.", "articleBody": "An image post of armed personnel in which a Facebook user claims it shows the Oromo Liberation Front (OLF) soldiers is ALTERED.\n\nThe post in Amharic has a headline that says, \u201cthe OLF Shane group has been eliminated\u201d.\n\n\u201cOLF shene, the group that allied with TPLF Junta to destabilise the country has been operating in some of Oromia regions, but its mission is being aborted,\u201d the post reads in part, adding \u201cirreversible actions were taken against the destabilizing force which planned to carry out terrorist actions in East Guji, Negelle Borana and Arsi Negelle areas\u201d.\n\nThe photo shows an armed group in military uniform standing in two lines, their heads covered with black scarves, while one holds up an OLF flag.\n\nThe names OLF Shane and Oromo Liberation Army (OLA) are widely used to refer to an armed group fighting against national troops in the Oromia regional state.\n\nReports by the Ethiopian Broadcasting Corporation, a state-owned broadcaster, seen here, here and here, say that coordinated action had been taken by Federal Police and Oromia special forces against OLF Shane on 8 December 2021.\n\nThe social media user copied the state broadcast news and shared it along with the image in the post.\n\nHowever, the attached image does not show OLF Shane or OLA, as claimed.\n\nGoogle reverse image search results show that the image shows a gathering of Somali Al Shabaab fighters in February 2012.

When these organisations rate v as false, we rank those stories significantly lower in News Feed. On average, this cuts future views by more than 80%. We also use the information from fact-checkers to improve our technology so we can identify more potential false news faster in the future.\u201d\n\nData from Portland Communications indicates that 49% Kenyans got their news about elections in August and October 2017 from social media.

The publisher drives organisational strategy, and partnerships. The newsroom is led by a managing editor, who is the senior editorial decision-maker and who is responsible for shaping editorial priorities and signing-off on all fact-checks before publication. The managing editor is assisted by three deputy editors; a news editor who manages the NewsDesk and in-country researchers/fact-checkers across the continent; a chief copy editor who manages the multilingual CopyDesk that uses a three-step process to check all fact-checks for factual accuracy and grammatical correctness; and a special projects editor who oversees PesaCheck\u2019s digital innovations including our DebunkBot, PromiseTracker, PesaYetu and TaxClock toolkits.\n\nThe editors are supported by deputies (including Francophone and Amharic language team coordinators), as well as newsdesk-based specialist data analysts/researchers.\n\nThe PesaCheck newsdesk receives additional support from CfA\u2019s wider data journalism and infographic design teams, as well as its digital engagement (social media and multimedia) team. And, PesaCheck works closely with CfA\u2019s Academy to help mentor and train other newsrooms or civic watchdogs.\n\nOur researchers\n\nPesaCheck\u2019s editorial team is composed of fact-checkers who have extensive journalistic experience, or who are research specialists in topics such as economics, public finances or development issues.\n\nOur fact-checkers are always locally based, in the 12 countries we report from, in Burkina Faso, Burundi, Cameroon, Central African Republic, C\u00f4te d\u2019Ivoire, Ethiopia, Guinea, Kenya, Mali, Niger, Tanzania and Uganda. We also run a Francophone regional support hub in Senegal.\n\nThe fact-checkers regularly collaborate on regional verification projects, tackling cross-cutting thematic issues such as the COVID-19 health emergency, or assisting each other as part of \u2018rapid response teams\u2019 during civil wars/conflicts/coups and during the run-up/polling during elections.\n\nPesaCheck occasionally appoints additional specialists, as short-term \u2018fellows\u2019 or associates, to drive specific projects such as our research into persistent conspiracy theories on YouTube or the spread of toxic speech (such as racist incitement and other hate speech) on WhatsApp.\n\nPesaCheck\u2019s fact-checkers focus on verifying the accuracy and meaning of the actual content in mis-/disinformation claims. Another CfA initiative, the iLAB at ANCIR, uses data science and forensic investigation to probe the \u2018hidden hand\u2019 networks and digital techniques used to make misleading content go viral. PesaCheck often collaborates with the iLAB and another CfA incubated initiative, the Digital Forensic Labs (DFRLab) Africa team, to expose large-scale coordinated inauthentic behaviour (CiB) and influence operations.\n\nMore information on the core PesaCheck team can be found here.\n\nOur sources\n\nThere is a lot of mis-/disinformation and other misleading content out there. This includes claims by public figures and pundits at public events and in the mainstream media (in print media, or on TV and radio, and on their online outlets), as well as on government or political party websites, on social media (including on chat platforms such as WhatsApp) or blogging and multimedia sites such as YouTube.\n\nPesaCheck believes it is important to apply a consistent set of criteria for determining eligibility for us to fact-check public claims, so that we can be consistently even-handed in our approach.\n\nWe also collect requests from the public on claims that need checking using this online form.\n\nAs a requirement for all our fact-checks, we include multiple sources of information and references. This helps to underline the veracity of our arguments. In addition, the sources are referenced accurately. To do this, we use sourceAFRICA, a repository of actionable documents.\n\nThrough sourceAFRICA, the PesaCheck team can:\n\nArchive the source documents for future reference\nAnnotate the specific page where the information is sourced from. As newspapers do not use complete references like academic papers, hyperlinks would serve to highlight the references. It also allows the readers an opportunity to review the document in its entirety.\n\nEvery source document that is referenced in a story is saved on sourceAFRICA in order to preserve a copy and link directly to the information being referenced.\n\nAll sources and facts to be checked will be recorded on Check, where fact-check requests crowdsourced from the public and from social media will be managed and updated as they progress.\n\nWe put a premium on story ideas generated by members of the public, as this indicates that the issue is of great public importance, and it is a good source of information that may not yet be in the public eye.\n\nTo underline the credibility of PesaCheck stories, we ensure that our sources are quoted comprehensively \u2014 full name and designation.\n\nAny information from sources that seek anonymity is treated as background information only. Such information must be corroborated by evidence.\n\nPesaCheck is committed to disclosing to its readers the sources of the information in its stories to the maximum possible extent. We want to make our reporting as transparent to the readers as possible so they may know how and where we got our information. Transparency is honest and fair, two values we cherish.\n\nIdentifying claims to be checked\n\nNot all statements are created equal. Here are some criteria that we use to help establish a hierarchy of important statements to fact-check:\n\nMembers of the public can also suggest claims to be fact-checked, by emailing us at [email protected] or reach the news editor at [email protected] They can also WhatsApp out tipline: +254754999992. If claims from the public meet the public interest criteria, they\u2019ll be looked into, and feedback provided on the channel it was shared.\n\nFact-checking guidelines\n\nWe have three main rules guiding our fact-checking process:\n\nGolden Rule 1: Only one fact per fact-check. We limit each fact check to one statement only, or a set of statements that are clearly related.\nGolden Rule 2: Check every fact check. We do our best to corroborate the fact/verification. For example, rather than using a newspaper story about the budget; we use the budget document to fact check a statement.\nGolden Rule 3: Draw a conclusion based on the facts. After all the research, corroboration and interviews, we assign a label to the fact check: True, Partially True, Untrue, Partially Untrue, or Inconclusive.\n\nWe use this checklist to write and prepare our fact-checks:\n\nIs the statement being checked included verbatim?\nIs there an explainer for why this statement was selected for checking?\nHas the category of deception been identified?\nHave all the sources for the fact being checked been identified?\nAny source documents used in the fact check need to be annotated and uploaded to sourceAfrica, including any additional useful data identified in the process of fact-checking.\nHas the reason for the labeling the statement True, Not True, etc been indicated?\nIs the label (true, not true etc) mentioned briefly at the top of the story, and in more detail at the end of the story?\nHave any links to the sources and the statement being checked been included in the body of the article?\n\nFinal editing checklist\n\nWe use the following final editing checklist based in part on the PolitiFact checklist:\n\n1. Is the claim open to interpretation? Is there another way to read the claim?\n\n2. Is the rating fair and consistent with other fact checks?\n\n3. Is the rating supported by all available facts? Do questions linger?\n\nSocial media policy\n\nSocial media is a key tool that we use to distribute our fact-checks. The following are guidelines that we use to keep our social media consistent and harmonised.\n\nWe don\u2019t post anything that we cannot stand by.\nAll posts follow a consistent structure \u2014 a question statement (what), a source (who) and a link to the story (where to find more).\nExample: FACT CHECK: Did @Kandie_Phyllis misspeak about pledging Sh18bn for disabled kids? @PesaCheck finds out: p://bit.ly/2aIxrqa\nEach fact check needs a standard hashtag, for example #PesaCheck\nAll reactions and comments are looked into, especially when they lead to potential follow-up stories that may arise out of the fact check.\n\nCorrections policy\n\nTransparency is a core value for PesaCheck, and we strive for accurate and comprehensive fact-checking. We all make mistakes sometimes, and while every error is a weakness, some errors are inevitable, and we are fully open to correcting them promptly in whatever material we publish on our platforms.\n\nWhen we run a correction, clarification or editor\u2019s note, our goal is to tell readers, as clearly and quickly as possible, what was wrong and what is correct. Anyone should be able to understand how and why a mistake has been corrected.\n\nIt is necessary to use a correction, clarification or editor\u2019s note to inform readers whenever we correct a significant mistake.\n\nUpdates are used to reflect important new information or clarifications; corrections are for mistakes.\n\nClarification\n\nWhen the content is factually correct but the language used to explain the facts is not as clear or detailed as it should be, the post will be rewritten and a clarification added to the story. A clarification can also be used to note that we initially failed to seek a comment or response that has since been added to the story.\n\nEditor\u2019s notes\n\nA correction that calls into question the entire substance of an article, raises a significant ethical matter or addresses whether an article did not meet our standards, may require an Editor\u2019s Note and be followed by an explanation of what is at issue.\n\nTherefore:\n\nWhen an error is brought to our attention, we will indicate in comments that it has been corrected.\nAny erroneous information published on our social platforms will be corrected on any and all platforms it was published on.\nWe do not attribute blame to individuals, but we may note that an error was the result of incorrect information from a trusted source.\n\nTake-down (unpublish) requests\n\nAs a matter of editorial policy, we do not grant take-down requests. If the subject claims that the story was inaccurate, we are prepared to investigate and, if necessary, publish a correction.\n\nStories will be updated if we checked a claim and drew a conclusion based on facts available at the time, but there is significant new information that will warrant a change in that conclusion.\n\nIn short, our response will be to consider whether further action is warranted, but not to remove the article as though it had never been published.\n\nRight of reply\n\nPersons who are the subject of a fact-check get a reasonable opportunity to respond to us.\n\nAttribution\n\nWe strive to be truthful about the source of our information. Facts and quotations in a story that were not produced by our own reporting need an attribution. Attribution of material from other media must be total. Plagiarism is not permitted.\n\nWe place a premium value on original reporting.", "articleBodyHtml": "<article>\n\n<p>PesaCheck is headed by a <strong>publisher</strong>, who is also CfA\u2019s chief executive officer (and co-founder).

A clarification can also be used to note that we initially failed to seek a comment or response that has since been added to the story.</p>\n\n<h3>Editor\u2019s notes</h3>\n\n<p>A correction that calls into question the entire substance of an article, raises a significant ethical matter or addresses whether an article did not meet our standards, may require an Editor\u2019s Note and be followed by an explanation of what is at issue.</p>\n\n<p>Therefore:</p>\n\n<ol><li>When an error is brought to our attention, we will indicate in comments that it has been corrected.</li><li>Any erroneous information published on our social platforms will be corrected on any and all platforms it was published on.</li><li>We do not attribute blame to individuals, but we may note that an error was the result of incorrect information from a trusted source.</li></ol>\n\n<h2>Take-down (unpublish) requests</h2>\n\n<p>As a matter of editorial policy, we do not grant take-down requests. If the subject claims that the story was inaccurate, we are prepared to investigate and, if necessary, publish a correction.</p>\n\n<p>Stories will be updated if we checked a claim and drew a conclusion based on facts available at the time, but there is <strong>significant </strong>new information that will warrant a change in that conclusion.</p>\n\n<p>In short, our response will be to consider whether further action is warranted, but not to remove the article as though it had never been published.</p>\n\n<h2>Right of reply</h2>\n\n<p>Persons who are the subject of a fact-check get a reasonable opportunity to respond to us.</p>\n\n<h2>Attribution</h2>\n\n<p>We strive to be truthful about the source of our information. Facts and quotations in a story that were not produced by our own reporting need an attribution. Attribution of material from other media must be total. Plagiarism is not permitted.</p>\n\n<p>We place a premium value on original reporting.</p>\n\n<figure><img alt=\"\" src=\"https://miro.medium.com/max/60/1*IfdsF3Mdjtu2ajo23QJs5g.png?q=20\"></figure>\n\n</article>", "canonicalUrl": "https://pesacheck.org/our-methodology-f3d77521a1ee"},{"url": "https://pesacheck.org/false-this-image-does-not-show-tplf-sudanese-or-egyptian-troops-trying-to-enter-ethiopia-f503003d6f5?source=post_page-----f503003d6f5-----------------------------------&gi=6f5411ac27d5", "probability": 0.9304013, "headline": "FALSE: This image does not show TPLF, Sudanese or Egyptian troops trying to enter Ethiopia", "datePublished": "2021-12-14T13:17:20.005000+00:00", "datePublishedRaw": "2021-12-14T13:17:20.005Z", "dateModified": "2021-12-14T13:17:30.811000+00:00", "dateModifiedRaw": "2021-12-14T13:17:30.811Z", "author": "PesaCheck", "authorsList": ["PesaCheck"], "inLanguage": "en", "mainImage": "https://miro.medium.com/max/800/1*Bt6veCM22ND0Z4ZT8tvtKg.png", "images": ["https://miro.medium.com/max/1400/1*Bt6veCM22ND0Z4ZT8tvtKg.png", "https://miro.medium.com/max/60/0*4hEo9Bo2vgqstfe_?q=20", "https://miro.medium.com/max/400/0*eHVPUzg79p-wQyZa"], "description": "The image has been uploaded to different websites since 2020 and is associated with reports of the border dispute between Ethiopia and\u2026", "articleBody": "An image posted on Facebook with a claim that it shows the Tigray People\u2019s Liberation Front (TPLF), along with Sudanese and Egyptian troops attempting to enter Ethiopia through Sudan is FALSE.\n\nThe post is accompanied by text in Amharic that reads in part,\n\n\u201cAction was taken by the Ethiopian Coalition forces on the troops trained in Sudan and sent to Ethiopia by TPLF.

The publisher drives organisational strategy, and partnerships. The newsroom is led by a managing editor, who is the senior editorial decision-maker and who is responsible for shaping editorial priorities and signing-off on all fact-checks before publication. The managing editor is assisted by three deputy editors; a news editor who manages the NewsDesk and in-country researchers/fact-checkers across the continent; a chief copy editor who manages the multilingual CopyDesk that uses a three-step process to check all fact-checks for factual accuracy and grammatical correctness; and a special projects editor who oversees PesaCheck\u2019s digital innovations including our DebunkBot, PromiseTracker, PesaYetu and TaxClock toolkits.\n\nThe editors are supported by deputies (including Francophone and Amharic language team coordinators), as well as newsdesk-based specialist data analysts/researchers.\n\nThe PesaCheck newsdesk receives additional support from CfA\u2019s wider data journalism and infographic design teams, as well as its digital engagement (social media and multimedia) team. And, PesaCheck works closely with CfA\u2019s Academy to help mentor and train other newsrooms or civic watchdogs.\n\nOur researchers\n\nPesaCheck\u2019s editorial team is composed of fact-checkers who have extensive journalistic experience, or who are research specialists in topics such as economics, public finances or development issues.\n\nOur fact-checkers are always locally based, in the 12 countries we report from, in Burkina Faso, Burundi, Cameroon, Central African Republic, C\u00f4te d\u2019Ivoire, Ethiopia, Guinea, Kenya, Mali, Niger, Tanzania and Uganda. We also run a Francophone regional support hub in Senegal.\n\nThe fact-checkers regularly collaborate on regional verification projects, tackling cross-cutting thematic issues such as the COVID-19 health emergency, or assisting each other as part of \u2018rapid response teams\u2019 during civil wars/conflicts/coups and during the run-up/polling during elections.\n\nPesaCheck occasionally appoints additional specialists, as short-term \u2018fellows\u2019 or associates, to drive specific projects such as our research into persistent conspiracy theories on YouTube or the spread of toxic speech (such as racist incitement and other hate speech) on WhatsApp.\n\nPesaCheck\u2019s fact-checkers focus on verifying the accuracy and meaning of the actual content in mis-/disinformation claims. Another CfA initiative, the iLAB at ANCIR, uses data science and forensic investigation to probe the \u2018hidden hand\u2019 networks and digital techniques used to make misleading content go viral. PesaCheck often collaborates with the iLAB and another CfA incubated initiative, the Digital Forensic Labs (DFRLab) Africa team, to expose large-scale coordinated inauthentic behaviour (CiB) and influence operations.\n\nMore information on the core PesaCheck team can be found here.\n\nOur sources\n\nThere is a lot of mis-/disinformation and other misleading content out there. This includes claims by public figures and pundits at public events and in the mainstream media (in print media, or on TV and radio, and on their online outlets), as well as on government or political party websites, on social media (including on chat platforms such as WhatsApp) or blogging and multimedia sites such as YouTube.\n\nPesaCheck believes it is important to apply a consistent set of criteria for determining eligibility for us to fact-check public claims, so that we can be consistently even-handed in our approach.\n\nWe also collect requests from the public on claims that need checking using this online form.\n\nAs a requirement for all our fact-checks, we include multiple sources of information and references. This helps to underline the veracity of our arguments. In addition, the sources are referenced accurately. To do this, we use sourceAFRICA, a repository of actionable documents.\n\nThrough sourceAFRICA, the PesaCheck team can:\n\nArchive the source documents for future reference\nAnnotate the specific page where the information is sourced from. As newspapers do not use complete references like academic papers, hyperlinks would serve to highlight the references. It also allows the readers an opportunity to review the document in its entirety.\n\nEvery source document that is referenced in a story is saved on sourceAFRICA in order to preserve a copy and link directly to the information being referenced.\n\nAll sources and facts to be checked will be recorded on Check, where fact-check requests crowdsourced from the public and from social media will be managed and updated as they progress.\n\nWe put a premium on story ideas generated by members of the public, as this indicates that the issue is of great public importance, and it is a good source of information that may not yet be in the public eye.\n\nTo underline the credibility of PesaCheck stories, we ensure that our sources are quoted comprehensively \u2014 full name and designation.\n\nAny information from sources that seek anonymity is treated as background information only. Such information must be corroborated by evidence.\n\nPesaCheck is committed to disclosing to its readers the sources of the information in its stories to the maximum possible extent. We want to make our reporting as transparent to the readers as possible so they may know how and where we got our information. Transparency is honest and fair, two values we cherish.\n\nIdentifying claims to be checked\n\nNot all statements are created equal. Here are some criteria that we use to help establish a hierarchy of important statements to fact-check:\n\nMembers of the public can also suggest claims to be fact-checked, by emailing us at [email protected] or reach the news editor at [email protected] They can also WhatsApp out tipline: +254754999992. If claims from the public meet the public interest criteria, they\u2019ll be looked into, and feedback provided on the channel it was shared.\n\nFact-checking guidelines\n\nWe have three main rules guiding our fact-checking process:\n\nGolden Rule 1: Only one fact per fact-check. We limit each fact check to one statement only, or a set of statements that are clearly related.\nGolden Rule 2: Check every fact check. We do our best to corroborate the fact/verification. For example, rather than using a newspaper story about the budget; we use the budget document to fact check a statement.\nGolden Rule 3: Draw a conclusion based on the facts. After all the research, corroboration and interviews, we assign a label to the fact check: True, Partially True, Untrue, Partially Untrue, or Inconclusive.\n\nWe use this checklist to write and prepare our fact-checks:\n\nIs the statement being checked included verbatim?\nIs there an explainer for why this statement was selected for checking?\nHas the category of deception been identified?\nHave all the sources for the fact being checked been identified?\nAny source documents used in the fact check need to be annotated and uploaded to sourceAfrica, including any additional useful data identified in the process of fact-checking.\nHas the reason for the labeling the statement True, Not True, etc been indicated?\nIs the label (true, not true etc) mentioned briefly at the top of the story, and in more detail at the end of the story?\nHave any links to the sources and the statement being checked been included in the body of the article?\n\nFinal editing checklist\n\nWe use the following final editing checklist based in part on the PolitiFact checklist:\n\n1. Is the claim open to interpretation? Is there another way to read the claim?\n\n2. Is the rating fair and consistent with other fact checks?\n\n3. Is the rating supported by all available facts? Do questions linger?\n\nSocial media policy\n\nSocial media is a key tool that we use to distribute our fact-checks. The following are guidelines that we use to keep our social media consistent and harmonised.\n\nWe don\u2019t post anything that we cannot stand by.\nAll posts follow a consistent structure \u2014 a question statement (what), a source (who) and a link to the story (where to find more).\nExample: FACT CHECK: Did @Kandie_Phyllis misspeak about pledging Sh18bn for disabled kids? @PesaCheck finds out: p://bit.ly/2aIxrqa\nEach fact check needs a standard hashtag, for example #PesaCheck\nAll reactions and comments are looked into, especially when they lead to potential follow-up stories that may arise out of the fact check.\n\nCorrections policy\n\nTransparency is a core value for PesaCheck, and we strive for accurate and comprehensive fact-checking. We all make mistakes sometimes, and while every error is a weakness, some errors are inevitable, and we are fully open to correcting them promptly in whatever material we publish on our platforms.\n\nWhen we run a correction, clarification or editor\u2019s note, our goal is to tell readers, as clearly and quickly as possible, what was wrong and what is correct. Anyone should be able to understand how and why a mistake has been corrected.\n\nIt is necessary to use a correction, clarification or editor\u2019s note to inform readers whenever we correct a significant mistake.\n\nUpdates are used to reflect important new information or clarifications; corrections are for mistakes.\n\nClarification\n\nWhen the content is factually correct but the language used to explain the facts is not as clear or detailed as it should be, the post will be rewritten and a clarification added to the story. A clarification can also be used to note that we initially failed to seek a comment or response that has since been added to the story.\n\nEditor\u2019s notes\n\nA correction that calls into question the entire substance of an article, raises a significant ethical matter or addresses whether an article did not meet our standards, may require an Editor\u2019s Note and be followed by an explanation of what is at issue.\n\nTherefore:\n\nWhen an error is brought to our attention, we will indicate in comments that it has been corrected.\nAny erroneous information published on our social platforms will be corrected on any and all platforms it was published on.\nWe do not attribute blame to individuals, but we may note that an error was the result of incorrect information from a trusted source.\n\nTake-down (unpublish) requests\n\nAs a matter of editorial policy, we do not grant take-down requests. If the subject claims that the story was inaccurate, we are prepared to investigate and, if necessary, publish a correction.\n\nStories will be updated if we checked a claim and drew a conclusion based on facts available at the time, but there is significant new information that will warrant a change in that conclusion.\n\nIn short, our response will be to consider whether further action is warranted, but not to remove the article as though it had never been published.\n\nRight of reply\n\nPersons who are the subject of a fact-check get a reasonable opportunity to respond to us.\n\nAttribution\n\nWe strive to be truthful about the source of our information. Facts and quotations in a story that were not produced by our own reporting need an attribution. Attribution of material from other media must be total. Plagiarism is not permitted.\n\nWe place a premium value on original reporting.", "articleBodyHtml": "<article>\n\n<p>PesaCheck is headed by a <strong>publisher</strong>, who is also CfA\u2019s chief executive officer (and co-founder).

To do this, we use<a href=\"https://sourceafrica.net/\"> sourceAFRICA,</a> a repository of actionable documents.</p>\n\n<p>Through sourceAFRICA, the PesaCheck team can:</p>\n\n<ul><li><strong>Archive</strong> the source documents for future reference</li><li><strong>Annotate</strong> the specific page where the information is sourced from. As newspapers do not use complete references like academic papers, hyperlinks would serve to highlight the references. It also allows the readers an opportunity to review the document in its entirety.</li></ul>\n\n<p>Every source document that is referenced in a story is saved on <a href=\"https://sourceafrica.net\">sourceAFRICA</a> in order to preserve a copy and link directly to the information being referenced.</p>\n\n<p>All sources and facts to be checked will be recorded on <a href=\"http://checkmedia.org\">Check</a>, where fact-check requests crowdsourced from the public and from social media will be managed and updated as they progress.</p>\n\n<p>We put a premium on story ideas generated by members of the public, as this indicates that the issue is of great public importance, and it is a good source of information that may not yet be in the public eye.</p>\n\n<p>To underline the credibility of PesaCheck stories, we ensure that our sources are quoted comprehensively \u2014 full name and designation.</p>\n\n<p>Any information from sources that seek anonymity is treated as background information only. Such information must be corroborated by evidence.</p>\n\n<p>PesaCheck is committed to disclosing to its readers the sources of the information in its stories to the maximum possible extent. We want to make our reporting as transparent to the readers as possible so they may know how and where we got our information. Transparency is honest and fair, two values we cherish.</p>\n\n<h2>Identifying claims to be checked</h2>\n\n<p>Not all statements are created equal. Here are some criteria that we use to help establish a hierarchy of important statements to fact-check:</p>\n\n<p>Members of the public can also suggest claims to be fact-checked, by emailing us at <a href=\"https://pesacheck.org/cdn-cgi/l/email-protection\" data-cfemail=\"87efe2ebebe8c7f7e2f4e6e4efe2e4eca9e8f5e0\">[email\u00a0protected]</a> or reach the news editor at <a href=\"https://pesacheck.org/cdn-cgi/l/email-protection\" data-cfemail=\"d2b6bda0b7b7bc92a2b7a1b3b1bab7b1b9fcbda0b5fc\">[email\u00a0protected]</a> They can also WhatsApp out tipline: +254754999992. If claims from the public meet the public interest criteria, they\u2019ll be looked into, and feedback provided on the channel it was shared.</p>\n\n<h2><strong>Fact-checking guidelines</strong></h2>\n\n<p>We have three main rules guiding our fact-checking process:</p>\n\n<ul><li><strong>Golden Rule 1: Only one fact per fact-check. </strong>We limit each fact check to one statement only, or a set of statements that are clearly related.</li><li><strong>Golden Rule 2: Check every fact check. </strong>We do our best to corroborate the fact/verification. For example, rather than using a newspaper story about the budget; we use the budget document to fact check a statement.</li><li><strong>Golden Rule 3: Draw a conclusion based on the facts. </strong>After all the research, corroboration and interviews, we assign a label to the fact check: <strong>True, Partially True, Untrue, Partially Untrue, </strong>or <strong>Inconclusive</strong>.</li></ul>\n\n<p>We use this <strong>checklist </strong>to write and prepare our fact-checks:</p>\n\n<ol><li>Is the statement being checked included verbatim?</li><li>Is there an explainer for why this statement was selected for checking?</li><li>Has the category of deception been identified?</li><li>Have all the sources for the fact being checked been identified? <br>Any source documents used in the fact check need to be annotated and uploaded to <a href=\"https://sourceafrica.net/\">sourceAfrica</a>, including any additional useful data identified in the process of fact-checking.</li><li>Has the reason for the labeling the statement True, Not True, etc been indicated?</li><li>Is the label (true, not true etc) mentioned briefly at the top of the story, and in more detail at the end of the story?</li><li>Have any links to the sources and the statement being checked been included in the body of the article?</li></ol>\n\n<h2><strong>Final editing checklist</strong></h2>\n\n<p>We use the following <strong>final editing checklist</strong> based in part on the <a href=\"https://www.factcheck.org/our-process/\">PolitiFact checklist</a>:</p>\n\n<p>1. Is the claim open to interpretation? Is there another way to read the claim?</p>\n\n<p>2. Is the rating fair and consistent with other fact checks?</p>\n\n<p>3. Is the rating supported by all available facts? Do questions linger?</p>\n\n<h2><strong>Social media policy</strong></h2>\n\n<p>Social media is a key tool that we use to distribute our fact-checks. The following are guidelines that we use to keep our social media consistent and harmonised.</p>\n\n<ol><li>We don\u2019t post anything that we cannot stand by.</li><li>All posts follow a consistent structure \u2014 a question statement (what), a source (who) and a link to the story (where to find more). <br>Example: <strong>FACT CHECK: Did</strong><a href=\"https://twitter.com/Kandie_Phyllis\"><strong> @Kandie_Phyllis</strong></a><strong> misspeak about pledging Sh18bn for disabled kids?</strong><a href=\"https://twitter.com/PesaCheck\"><strong> @PesaCheck</strong></a><strong> finds out: </strong><a href=\"https://t.co/385A4LbHhl\"><strong>p://bit.ly/2aIxrqa</strong></a></li><li>Each fact check needs a standard hashtag, for example <a href=\"https://twitter.com/hashtag/PesaCheck?src=hash\">#PesaCheck</a></li><li>All reactions and comments are looked into, especially when they lead to potential follow-up stories that may arise out of the fact check.</li></ol>\n\n<h2>Corrections policy</h2>\n\n<p>Transparency is a core value for PesaCheck, and we strive for accurate and comprehensive fact-checking. We all make mistakes sometimes, and while every error is a weakness, some errors are inevitable, and we are fully open to correcting them promptly in whatever material we publish on our platforms.</p>\n\n<p>When we run a correction, clarification or editor\u2019s note, our goal is to tell readers, as clearly and quickly as possible, what was wrong and what is correct. Anyone should be able to understand how and why a mistake has been corrected.</p>\n\n<p>It is necessary to use a correction, clarification or editor\u2019s note to inform readers whenever we correct a significant mistake.</p>\n\n<p>Updates are used to reflect important new information or clarifications; corrections are for mistakes.</p>\n\n<h3>Clarification</h3>\n\n<p>When the content is factually correct but the language used to explain the facts is not as clear or detailed as it should be, the post will be rewritten and a clarification added to the story. A clarification can also be used to note that we initially failed to seek a comment or response that has since been added to the story.</p>\n\n<h3>Editor\u2019s notes</h3>\n\n<p>A correction that calls into question the entire substance of an article, raises a significant ethical matter or addresses whether an article did not meet our standards, may require an Editor\u2019s Note and be followed by an explanation of what is at issue.</p>\n\n<p>Therefore:</p>\n\n<ol><li>When an error is brought to our attention, we will indicate in comments that it has been corrected.</li><li>Any erroneous information published on our social platforms will be corrected on any and all platforms it was published on.</li><li>We do not attribute blame to individuals, but we may note that an error was the result of incorrect information from a trusted source.</li></ol>\n\n<h2>Take-down (unpublish) requests</h2>\n\n<p>As a matter of editorial policy, we do not grant take-down requests. If the subject claims that the story was inaccurate, we are prepared to investigate and, if necessary, publish a correction.</p>\n\n<p>Stories will be updated if we checked a claim and drew a conclusion based on facts available at the time, but there is <strong>significant </strong>new information that will warrant a change in that conclusion.</p>\n\n<p>In short, our response will be to consider whether further action is warranted, but not to remove the article as though it had never been published.</p>\n\n<h2>Right of reply</h2>\n\n<p>Persons who are the subject of a fact-check get a reasonable opportunity to respond to us.</p>\n\n<h2>Attribution</h2>\n\n<p>We strive to be truthful about the source of our information. Facts and quotations in a story that were not produced by our own reporting need an attribution. Attribution of material from other media must be total. Plagiarism is not permitted.</p>\n\n<p>We place a premium value on original reporting.</p>\n\n<figure><img alt=\"\" src=\"https://miro.medium.com/max/60/1*IfdsF3Mdjtu2ajo23QJs5g.png?q=20\"></figure>\n\n</article>", "canonicalUrl": "https://pesacheck.org/our-methodology-f3d77521a1ee"},{"url": "https://pesacheck.org/false-this-video-doesnt-show-kenya-s-president-kenyatta-ignoring-covid-19-guidelines-6301e4ee4c39?source=post_internal_links---------0-------------------------------&gi=3d1377a165e9", "probability": 0.953225, "headline": "FALSE: This video doesn\u2019t show Kenya\u2019s President Kenyatta ignoring COVID-19 guidelines", "datePublished": "2020-10-27T21:31:39.886000+00:00", "datePublishedRaw": "2020-10-27T21:31:39.886Z", "dateModified": "2020-10-27T21:31:40.130000+00:00", "dateModifiedRaw": "2020-10-27T21:31:40.130Z", "author": "PesaCheck", "authorsList": ["PesaCheck"], "inLanguage": "en", "mainImage": "https://miro.medium.com/max/800/1*zqdFH88uJDMNCORHabmIYg.png", "images": ["https://miro.medium.com/max/1400/1*zqdFH88uJDMNCORHabmIYg.png", "https://miro.medium.com/max/50/0*okJif4I2fM9zyEZv?q=20", "https://miro.medium.com/max/400/0*EIa6SHzCGrljqore", "https://miro.medium.com/max/60/0*HIRclSNjx629NVeS?q=20"], "description": "The claim uses a 2017 video of President Uhuru Kenyatta dancing in a crowd without a mask to show that the political class are ignoring\u2026", "articleBody": "The claim uses a 2017 video of President Uhuru Kenyatta dancing in a crowd without a mask to show that the political class are ignoring the pandemic.\n\nA video shared on Twitter claiming to show President Uhuru Kenyatta dancing in a crowd without a face mask in spite of the COVID-19 pandemic is FALSE.\n\nThe tweet, posted on October 26, via @bob_odhiambo\u2019s handle, condemns President Kenyatta for not caring about the safety of others.\n\nWhile it is true that the president was dancing without a mask, a search using the keywords \u2018Uhuru dancing to Kenya kipenzi chetu\u2019 shows the video was taken in 2017, and not in 2020 as alleged in the post.\n\nIt was first shared on YouTube on October 31, 2017, long before the advent of the global outbreak of the coronavirus disease, and shows President Kenyatta singing and dancing to the song \u2018Kenya kipenzi changu\u2019.\n\nPesaCheck has looked into the claim that a video shared on Twitter shows President Uhuru Kenyatta dancing in a crowd without a mask during the COVID-19 pandemic and finds it to be FALSE.", "articleBodyHtml": "<article>\n\n<h2><strong>The claim uses a 2017 video of President Uhuru Kenyatta dancing in a crowd without a mask to show that the political class are ignoring the pandemic.</strong></h2>\n\n<figure><img alt=\"\" src=\"https://miro.medium.com/max/1400/1*zqdFH88uJDMNCORHabmIYg.png\"></figure>\n\n<p>A video <a href=\"https://archive.ph/Iau3B\">shared on Twitter</a> claiming to show President Uhuru Kenyatta dancing in a crowd without a face mask in spite of the COVID-19 pandemic is FALSE.</p>\n\n<p>The tweet, posted on October 26, via @bob_odhiambo\u2019s handle, condemns President Kenyatta for not caring about the safety of others.</p>\n\n<figure><img alt=\"\" src=\"https://miro.medium.com/max/50/0*okJif4I2fM9zyEZv?q=20\"></figure>\n\n<p>While it is true that the president was dancing without a mask, a <a href=\"https://www.google.com/search?q=Uhuru+dancing+kenya+kipenzi+chetu&amp;rlz=1C5CHFA_enKE888KE888&amp;oq=Uhuru+dancing+kenya+kipenzi+chetu&amp;aqs=chrome..69i57.13290j0j7&amp;sourceid=chrome&amp;ie=UTF-8\">search using the keywords </a>\u2018Uhuru dancing to Kenya kipenzi chetu\u2019 shows the video was taken in 2017, and not in 2020 as alleged in the post.</p>\n\n<p>It was first shared on <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I3aken0J1D0&amp;feature=emb_logo\">YouTube</a> on October 31, 2017, long before the advent of the global outbreak of the coronavirus disease, and shows President Kenyatta singing and dancing to the song \u2018Kenya kipenzi changu\u2019.</p>\n\n<p>PesaCheck has looked into the claim that a video shared on Twitter shows President Uhuru Kenyatta dancing in a crowd without a mask during the COVID-19 pandemic and finds it to be FALSE.</p>\n\n</article>", "canonicalUrl": "https://pesacheck.org/false-this-video-doesnt-show-kenya-s-president-kenyatta-ignoring-covid-19-guidelines-6301e4ee4c39"}]
