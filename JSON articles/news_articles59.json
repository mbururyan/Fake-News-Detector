It was upon HJO to adduce evidence to prove the existence of traditional marriage or presumption of marriage. A mere allegation that they got married in 2010 without proof is not sustainable,\u201d said the judge.\n\nJustice Onyiego observed that the only evidence available is that the woman got married to the man in 2015, which is five years after the disputed property was acquired.\n\nAlso, the court noted that there was no evidence of improvements done on the property during the coverture and, therefore, the same is not the subject of matrimonial property for division or distribution.\n\n\u201cTo that extent, the issue of contribution does not arise whether directly or indirectly,\u201d said Justice Onyiego.\n\nThe court battle between the couple started in 2017 after the man filed for divorce before the Kadhi\u2019s Court in Mombasa.\n\nThe couple accused each other of infidelity, dishonesty, cruelty amongst other allegations, and asked that the marriage be dissolved because it had irretrievably broken.\n\nThe man asked that the woman be ordered to compensate him for causing the divorce.\n\nThe man told the court that he came to Kenya in 2007 as a businessman and engaged in buying shoes from Tanzania and selling the same in Mombasa.\n\n\u201cI then started cohabiting with the woman in 2009. I took her to Tanzania the following year and had our union solemnized in accordance with the Maasai culture and customs,\u201d he said.\n\nHe claimed that they together bought the land on December 5, 2010, before putting up a modern house consisting of more than 8 rooms.\n\nAccording to HJO, the property could not be registered in his name because he had not obtained the necessary documentation hence the reason his name did not appear in the ownership documents.\n\nThey then moved to the house in 2014, converted to Islam religion, and solemnized their Islamic marriage the following year before the Kadhi.\n\nIn her defense, the woman accused the man of being irresponsible as he never supported her financially and that he was a dishonest person who never disclosed that he had another wife in Tanzania.\n\nShe further denied ever engaging in any Maasai traditional marriage ceremony with the man or ever being introduced to any of the man\u2019s relatives. She, however, admitted celebrating Islamic marriage with the man in 2015.\n\n\u201cI was single when I bought and developed the subject plot, we had not started cohabiting,\u201d she said\n\nAfter listening to the two, Kadhi\u2019s court dissolved the marriage but directed that the couple share the property on a 50:50 basis.\n\nThis decision aggrieved the woman, who preferred an appeal to the High Court, Family Division, lamenting that the Kadhi\u2019s court ignored her evidence that she had bought the property and built it single-handedly before she married the man.\n\nJustice Onyiego agreed with the woman after reviewing the evidence, noting that he could not find a record of how the man contributed to the purchase and development of the property.\n\nBut more importantly, the judge noted that the property was acquired by the woman before the coverture.\n\n\u201cA declaration thereof made herein that the said property was solely acquired by the woman before marriage to the man and, therefore, her property 100 per cent,\u201d said the judge.", "articleBodyHtml": "<article>\n\n<h2><a href=\"https://www.businessdailyafrica.com/bd/news/east-africa/tanzania\"

She, however, admitted celebrating Islamic marriage with the man in 2015.</p>\n\n<p>\u201cI was single when I bought and developed the subject plot, we had not started cohabiting,\u201d she said</p>\n\n<p>After listening to the two, Kadhi\u2019s court dissolved the marriage but directed that the couple share the property on a 50:50 basis.</p>\n\n<p>This decision aggrieved the woman, who preferred an appeal to the High Court, Family Division, lamenting that the Kadhi\u2019s court ignored her evidence that she had bought the property and built it single-handedly before she married the man.</p>\n\n<p>Justice Onyiego agreed with the woman after reviewing the evidence, noting that he could not find a record of how the man contributed to the purchase and development of the property.</p>\n\n<p>But more importantly, the judge noted that the property was acquired by the woman before the coverture.</p>\n\n<p>\u201cA declaration thereof made herein that the said property was solely acquired by the woman before marriage to the man and, therefore, her property 100 per cent,\u201d said the judge.</p>\n\n</article>", "canonicalUrl": "https://www.businessdailyafrica.com/bd/news/east-africa/tanzania/tanzanian-loses-his-property-kenyan-in-marriage-dispute-3677780"},{"url": "https://www.businessdailyafrica.com/bd/news/counties/kenya-railways-loses-rent-battle-with-firm-3679086", "probability": 0.96016276, "headline": "Kenya Railways loses rent battle with firm, told to refund millions", "datePublished": "2022-01-11T21:00:00+00:00", "datePublishedRaw": "2022-01-11T21:00:00Z", "dateModified": "2022-01-11T15:16:24+00:00", "dateModifiedRaw": "2022-01-11T15:16:24Z", "author": "BRIAN OCHARO", "authorsList": ["BRIAN OCHARO"], "inLanguage": "en", "breadcrumbs": [{"name": "Home", "link": "https://www.businessdailyafrica.com/bd"}, {"name": "News", "link": "https://www.businessdailyafrica.com/bd/news"}, {"name": "Counties", "link": "https://www.businessdailyafrica.com/bd/news/counties"}], "mainImage": "https://www.businessdailyafrica.com/resource/blob/3679088/0e3b1a664d7ba699d0819e79c34ae99d/kr-data.jpg", "description": "\nKenya Railways Corporation has suffered a blow in a rent dispute with a container and tableware manufacture after a court in Mombasa ordered it to refund the firm millions of shillings.", "articleBody": "Counties\n\nKenya Railways Corporation has suffered a blow in a rent dispute with a container and tableware manufacture after a court in Mombasa ordered it to refund the firm millions of shillings it has been collecting illegally as rent.\n\nCourt records show that the corporation has been demanding Sh10.2 million annually as rent from Milly Glass Works Ltd since 2012 as opposed to Sh146,000 that it was supposed to collect from the firm over the same period.\n\nThis means that if the firm complied and made the payment of Sh10.2 million annually, then Kenya Railways has so far received more than Sh90 million instead of Sh1.4 million.\n\nEnvironment and Land Court Judge Sila Munyao has termed this as an unjust enrichment that the court cannot close its eyes to.\n\n\u201cI will use my wide discretion to order KR to refund to the firm all sums paid which exceed the annual amount of Sh146,000 per year.

The third failure happened after 5 pm and was yet to be resolved by the time of going to press.\n\nThe blackouts resulted in yet-to-be quantified financial losses due to economic disruptions.\n\nKenya Power said the mid-morning outage on its grid happened after towers supporting a high-voltage power line linking Nairobi to the Kiambere hydroelectric dam collapsed at around 10.45 am.\n\nThe monopoly did not publicly disclose what caused the fall of the towers, but insiders said earlier indications pointed to possible vandalism of the installation based at Nairobi\u2019s Imara Daima area.\n\n\u201cIt appears this is a case of vandalism, but this is not yet conclusive. The line is near a slum dwelling,\u201d the Kenya Power official said. \u201cYes, it is an old-line, but it has been very stable at least for the longest time I have been here.\u201d\n\nThe 10.45 am outage took nearly four hours before some parts were restored after repair works by Kenya Power.\n\nBy 5 pm, the utility said power had been restored to all parts of the country except Kitui, Mwingi and Garissa which it expected to reconnect supply by 6 pm.\n\nThe utility, however, reported another major fault on the Suswa-Embakasi high-voltage line, affecting sections of the Nairobi Central Business District, Kilimani, Hurlingham, Syokimau, Athi River, Kitengela, Mlolongo and adjacent areas.\n\nIt was not immediately clear what caused the third hitch, with Kenya Power indicating its engineers were working with those from Ketraco \u201cto locate the fault and address it\u201d.\n\nManufacturers, commercial building owners, warehouses, farmers and small businesses such as salons and barbershops largely depend on electricity to operate.\n\nAn extended outage usually leads to losses and additional expenses from using generators.\n\nFrequent blackouts due to supply shortfalls \u2014 and sometimes because of ageing distribution and transmission infrastructure \u2014 have forced most businesses and wealthy homes to have standby generators or install solar systems.\n\n\u201cWhenever there\u2019s a fault on one of our major lines, it destabilises the entire network,\u201d the Kenya Power source said.\n\nMore than seven million customers were hit by the early morning outage of May 9, 2020 following a fault on a section of a high-voltage line transmitting electricity to Nairobi from the Olkaria geothermal power plants near Naivasha.\n\nThe fault in May 2020, which also affected Uganda since the grids in the two countries are inter-connected, resulted in \u201cpower loss on the critical power line, thus overloading the other power generators countrywide\u201d.\n\nA similar outage was reported on January 9, 2018, due to a \u201ctechnical hitch\u201d and also disrupted supply in Uganda.\n\nTuesday\u2019s blackout came barely two weeks after the State-controlled utility firm and Ketraco restored power transmission from 310.25-megawatt Lake Turkana Wind Power (LTWP) on Loiyangalani line to the Suswa substation which had collapsed in December.\n\nThis had resulted in power rationing in some parts of the country, including Nairobi, during peak hours from 7pm to 9.30pm.\n\nLatest data, however, suggests the frequency and longevity of blackouts has fallen in recent years.\n\nFor example, the average time customers were cut off power supply \u2014 technically referred to as Customer Average Interruption Duration Index (CAIDI) \u2014 dropped to 4.03 hours in the year ended June 2021 compared with 4.52 hours in the prior year.\n\n\u201cBy expeditiously addressing network outages and improving our system reliability in general, we managed to improve our sales by 34GWh, which is approximately Sh360 million in revenues,\u201d Kenya Power wrote in annual report for the period through June 2021.\n\nThe blackout came at a time the Energy and Petroleum Regulatory Authority (Epra) is seeking to compel electricity utilities to compensate consumers for financial losses, equipment damage, physical injuries and death due to power outages.\n\nCurrently, Kenya Power compensates for injuries and damaged kits but does not pay for financial loss as a result of being cut off electricity supply.\n\nThe draft regulations will see Kenya adopt the model in most European countries that require utilities to compensate users whose homes and businesses are cut off power for prolonged periods if it becomes law.\n\nIn 2015, the government rejected a proposed law that required Kenya Power to compensate businesses whose power is cut off for more than three hours within a day.\n\nThe Bill, which had been sponsored by Mvita MP Abdulswamad Nassir, had proposed that Kenya Power include the compensation in power bills and use it to offset future electricity costs.", "articleBodyHtml": "<article>\n\n<figure><img

Ports Authority (KPA) acquired a Sh1.9 billion multipurpose salvage tugboat.", "articleBody": "Efficiency at the port of Mombasa is set to be boosted after the Kenya Ports Authority (KPA) acquired a Sh1.9 billion multipurpose salvage tugboat and three ship-to-shore gantry cranes at Sh3.3 billion.\n\nThe salvage tugboat bought from Turkey and three ship-to-shore gantry cranes from Japan will boost efficiency and bulk handling activities at the second container terminal. This follows President Uhuru Kenyatta\u2019s order for port efficiency to boost businesses in East Africa.\n\nLast week, when he visited the Kipevu Oil Terminal which will be fully commissioned, the Head of State urged port officials to boost efficiency and deal with many challenges including congestion.\n\nThe multipurpose tugboat boat will provide rescue services, marine salvage, fire suppression at sea and control maritime pollution.\n\nKPA general manager operation and harbour, Sudi Mwasingo said the newly acquired salvage tugboat will open new markets for port operators.\n\nKPA has already received business requests for the use of the tugboat for rescue marine operations during emergencies.\n\n\"The authority can recover the sum spent to acquire the tugboat during its operations. It will not only assist in salvage operations at sea but open a new market,\" he said while addressing the media during the reception of the new tugboat at the new dockyard tug jetty at the Port of Mombasa.\n\nMr Sudi said the cranes will assist the port in terms of efficiency, increased berth throughput, faster ship turnaround and reduced waiting time.\n\n\u201cThe decision to acquire the salvage boat was reached after we established that KPA was incurring a lot of expenses in hiring salvage services. The tugboat has been christened Mkokozi 11, it took 20 days to arrive from Turkey,\u201d said Mr Mwasingo.\n\n\u201cLast year MV Theresa Arctic ran aground near the entrance to the Kilifi Creek while sailing to the port of Mombasa, KPA was forced to take services of an international firm to salvage the vessel. The boat will boost KPA\u2019s revenue streams,\u201d he added.\n\nMr Mwasingo an engineer by profession said in the entire African region it is only in South Africa that has salvage boats.\n\nThe tugboat was built by Med Marine in Turkey. It is installed with Two SCHOTTEL Rudder Propellers type SRP 710.\n\nMkokozi 11 is equipped with main and auxiliary systems from SCHOTTEL to enable it to achieve an expected bollard pull of more than 120 tonnes. The Robert Allan RAstar 4200 (MED-A42120) design vessel is considered the largest tugboat on the East African coast of the Indian Ocean.\n\nThe new vessel will be driven by two SCHOTTEL RudderPropellers type SRP 710 with an input power of 3,700 kW each at an input speed of 1,000 rpm. The SRPs feature propellers measuring 3.4 meters in diameter. The azimuth thrusters will be powered by diesel engines.\n\nFurthermore, one hydraulically-driven SCHOTTEL Transverse Thruster type STT 170 (250 kW) will ensure maximum maneuverability.\n\nKPA in a statement said the highly effective propulsion system will enable the tug to provide more efficient ship handling and coastal towing services.\n\nMeasuring 42 meters in length at a width of 16 meters, the salvage tug is equipped with extensive towing facilities, extinguishing monitors for firefighting, external bilge systems for leak detection, workshops, ship cranes and dinghies.\n\nActing general manager KPA engineering services, Javan Wanga said offloading and commissioning of the gantry cranes to make them ready for use will take two months.\n\nHe said the equipment will position the port for Mombasa to be a hub port within the region. The facility can do more than 550,000 TEUs annually.

PHOTO | KEVIN ODIT | NMG</p></figcaption></figure>\n\n<p>Efficiency at the port of Mombasa is set to be boosted after the Kenya Ports Authority (KPA) acquired a Sh1.9 billion multipurpose salvage tugboat and three ship-to-shore gantry cranes at Sh3.3 billion.</p>\n\n<p>The salvage tugboat bought from Turkey and three ship-to-shore gantry cranes from Japan will boost efficiency and bulk handling activities at the second container terminal. This follows President Uhuru Kenyatta\u2019s order for port efficiency to boost businesses in East Africa.</p>\n\n<p>Last week, when he visited the Kipevu Oil Terminal which will be fully commissioned, the Head of State urged port officials to boost efficiency and deal with many challenges including congestion.</p>\n\n<p>The multipurpose tugboat boat will provide rescue services, marine salvage, fire suppression at sea and control maritime pollution.</p>\n\n<p>KPA general manager operation and harbour, Sudi Mwasingo said the newly acquired salvage tugboat will open new markets for port operators.</p>\n\n<p>KPA has already received business requests for the use of the tugboat for rescue marine operations during emergencies.</p>\n\n<p>\"The authority can recover the sum spent to acquire the tugboat during its operations. It will not only assist in salvage operations at sea but open a new market,\" he said while addressing the media during the reception of the new tugboat at the new dockyard tug jetty at the Port of Mombasa.</p>\n\n<p>Mr Sudi said the cranes will assist the port in terms of efficiency, increased berth throughput, faster ship turnaround and reduced waiting time.</p>\n\n<p>\u201cThe decision to acquire the salvage boat was reached after we established that KPA was incurring a lot of expenses in hiring salvage services. The tugboat has been christened Mkokozi 11, it took 20 days to arrive from Turkey,\u201d said Mr Mwasingo.</p>\n\n<p>\u201cLast year MV Theresa Arctic ran aground near the entrance to the Kilifi Creek while sailing to the port of Mombasa, KPA was forced to take services of an international firm to salvage the vessel. The boat will boost KPA\u2019s revenue streams,\u201d he added.</p>\n\n<p>Mr Mwasingo an engineer by profession said in the entire African region it is only in South Africa that has salvage boats.</p>\n\n<p>The tugboat was built by Med Marine in Turkey. It is installed with Two SCHOTTEL Rudder Propellers type SRP 710.</p>\n\n<p>Mkokozi 11 is equipped with main and auxiliary systems from SCHOTTEL to enable it to achieve an expected bollard pull of more than 120 tonnes. The Robert Allan RAstar 4200 (MED-A42120) design vessel is considered the largest tugboat on the East African coast of the Indian Ocean.</p>\n\n<p>The new vessel will be driven by two SCHOTTEL RudderPropellers type SRP 710 with an input power of 3,700 kW each at an input speed of 1,000 rpm. The SRPs feature propellers measuring 3.4 meters in diameter. The azimuth thrusters will be powered by diesel engines.</p>\n\n<p>Furthermore, one hydraulically-driven SCHOTTEL Transverse Thruster type STT 170 (250 kW) will ensure maximum maneuverability.</p>\n\n<p>KPA in a statement said the highly effective propulsion system will enable the tug to provide more efficient ship handling and coastal towing services.</p>\n\n<p>Measuring 42 meters in length at a width of 16 meters, the salvage tug is equipped with extensive towing facilities, extinguishing monitors for firefighting, external bilge systems for leak detection, workshops, ship cranes and dinghies.</p>\n\n<p>Acting general manager KPA engineering services, Javan Wanga said offloading and commissioning of the gantry cranes to make them ready for use will take two months.</p>\n\n<p>He said the equipment will position the port for Mombasa to be a hub port within the region. The facility can do more than 550,000 TEUs annually. Currently, the port is doing 1.2 million.</p>\n\n<p>\u201cThe crane has a capacity of moving to and fro the ship containers 40 moves per hour with a hoisting speed of the load a maximum of 80 metres per minute traveling along the rails above 45 metres per minute. It\u2019s modern equipment.

rail transport along the northern corridor.", "articleBody": "Traders and transport players are banking on the plan to kick off operations between Naivasha Inland Container Depot from the Standard Gauge Railway (SGR) to the old meter-gauge railway (MGR) to significantly ease transport of goods.\n\nTraders and players say the move will underpin seamless and efficient rail transport along the northern corridor.\n\n\u201cThe integration of the SGR and MGR lines will remarkably improve the flow of cargo right from the port to the hinterland serving Uganda, Rwanda, Burundi, South Sudan and parts of eastern Democratic Republic of Congo,\u201d said KRC managing director Philip Mainga.\n\nKenya Railways Corporation (KRC) has already started trial runs for freight train services to offer seamless cargo transfer at the Naivasha Inland Container Depot from the standard gauge railway (SGR) to the old metre gauge railway (MGR).\n\nThe trial of 22 containers to be ferried to Kampala through Malaba using MGR started this week before full operations can resume in March this year.\n\nThis happens as the government continues to address a number of issues to increase efficiency at the Naivasha Inland Container Depot which has the capacity to hold handle 120,000 twenty-feet equivalent units (TEUS) annually.\n\nTo entice more users, the government has offered 30-day free storage and quick cargo processing and transshipment of the wagons\n\nIn December 2021, KRC announced promotional tariffs to ferry cargo using MGR where a 20-foot container of up to 30 tonnes from Naivasha to Malaba will cost up to Sh39,550 and Sh50,850 for 30 tonnes.\n\nThe government a gazetted a 40-foot container weighing up to 30 tonnes in the same direction will cost Sh51,980 while one above 30 tonnes will be charged Sh68,930.\n\nCharges for containerised cargo from Kilindini to Malaba for a 20-foot container weighing 0-30 will cost Sh97,180 and Sh108,480 for a container above 30 tonnes.\n\nThe Kenya International Freight and Warehousing Association (KIFWA) Chairperson Roy Mwanthi said KRC might give an encouraging offer to haul cargo but they need to address reverse strategy to ensure

They thrive on falsehood and mistrust of others. Could this be a mental issue?\n\n*****\n\nOn the face of it, yours is a rather simple question that can be dismissed in a few sentences and perhaps without much thought.\n\nIn reality, you have asked a very deep question that must take us through considerations of who relatives are, why we need them, and indeed ask the question, what is the meaning and purpose of community living. It is only with answers to these questions that we can meaningfully address yours.\n\nPut differently you have asked a question that demands that we look at human evolution and more specifically at language development.\n\nComing back to your question briefly and by way of paraphrasing, you would like to know why your relatives are such gossips, but you would also like us to help you deal with the negative aspects of gossip. That in a nutshell would seem to be your question.\n\nBefore we help you deal with your gossiping relatives, you may want to consider the fact that the art of gossiping is a relatively new human activity, having come to us only in the last 60,000 years of human existence.\n\nBefore that, we could not gossip because we did not have the language with which to do so! Like our cousins the chimpanzees and bonobos, we communicated by making sounds and touching each other, as in scratching each other in the back to express friendship.\n\nIn time, over the years, as we came down from life in the trees, we became upright and did not need to walk on all fours. Our brains became bigger and more complex. Put differently we evolved as humans and the size of our brains relative to the rest of the body became very large.\n\nWith this sudden increase in the size of our brains came the evolution of language which soon saw the development of gossip. We could, at last, be able to tell our relatives where to find the best berries and where water could be found with ease and in time, we told each other which were the best hunting routes.\n\nIt even became possible to tell each other who were the good and which were the bad people. The kind and considerate relatives and neighbours were also discussed in words! Mean and cruel people could be avoided even if one had not met them before, because, by the use of this new tool, one could gossip for the benefit and safety of those he cared for.\n\nLanguage had changed the way life was to be lived forever. Stories became possible and humans could travel in their stories to places they had never been to. Because of this ability the size of the groups one could belong to, increased in size to its present number of 150 people. Language leads to many changes in society that are uniquely human.\n\nIn this theory, one has a maximum number of five intimate relationships, knows a maximum of 1500 people by name and has meaningful relationships with a maximum of 150 people. All this is aided by the fact that we can gossip to each other. We have sounds that we make that mean the same thing to those that have large brains like us.\n\nComing back to your relatives and their talking about you, you must remember that gossiping started its life as a good thing and that some experts in human psychology have argued that gossiping (also called exchange of ideas) is a normal human instinct that should not be suppressed.\n\nYou may also want to think about the fact that most people gossip about people who have desirable characteristics that the gossiper does not have (a new boyfriend, a car, a house or even a new job).\n\nAs your relatives continue to gossip about you, what is it that you do that they are jealous about? Also, why do you want them to stop admiring you? You must be doing something right!\n\nThe only person who must not be in a position to spread what you call \u201cfalsehood\u201d about you is yourself. You must evaluate yourself and make sure that your judgement of yourself and self-worth is promotive of good mental health.\n\nSome people come to us because of low self-esteem.

FILE PHOTO | NMG</p></figcaption></figure>\n\n<p><strong><em>Question:\u00a0</em></strong><em>Sorry this may have been asked before but how do you politely deal with relatives who are so judgmental about everything? They thrive on falsehood and mistrust of others. Could this be a mental issue?</em></p>\n\n<p><em>*****</em></p>\n\n<p>On the face of it, yours is a rather simple question that can be dismissed in a few sentences and perhaps without much thought.</p>\n\n<p>In reality, you have asked a very deep question that must take us through considerations of who relatives are, why we need them, and indeed ask the question, what is the meaning and purpose of community living. It is only with answers to these questions that we can meaningfully address yours.</p>\n\n<p>Put differently you have asked a question that demands that we look at human evolution and more specifically at language development.</p>\n\n<p>Coming back to your question briefly and by way of paraphrasing, you would like to know why your relatives are such gossips, but you would also like us to help you deal with the negative aspects of gossip. That in a nutshell would seem to be your question.</p>\n\n<p>Before we help you deal with your gossiping relatives, you may want to consider the fact that the art of gossiping is a relatively new human activity, having come to us only in the last 60,000 years of human existence.</p>\n\n<p>Before that, we could not gossip because we did not have the language with which to do so! Like our cousins the chimpanzees and bonobos, we communicated by making sounds and touching each other, as in scratching each other in the back to express friendship.</p>\n\n<p>In time, over the years, as we came down from life in the trees, we became upright and did not need to walk on all fours. Our brains became bigger and more complex. Put differently we evolved as humans and the size of our brains relative to the rest of the body became very large.</p>\n\n<p>With this sudden increase in the size of our brains came the evolution of language which soon saw the development of gossip. We could, at last, be able to tell our relatives where to find the best berries and where water could be found with ease and in time, we told each other which were the best hunting routes.</p>\n\n<p>It even became possible to tell each other who were the good and which were the bad people. The kind and considerate relatives and neighbours were also discussed in words! Mean and cruel people could be avoided even if one had not met them before, because, by the use of this new tool, one could gossip for the benefit and safety of those he cared for.</p>\n\n<p>Language had changed the way life was to be lived forever. Stories became possible and humans could travel in their stories to places they had never been to. Because of this ability the size of the groups one could belong to, increased in size to its present number of 150 people. Language leads to many changes in society that are uniquely human.</p>\n\n<p>In this theory, one has a maximum number of five intimate relationships, knows a maximum of 1500 people by name and has meaningful relationships with a maximum of 150 people. All this is aided by the fact that we can gossip to each other. We have sounds that we make that mean the same thing to those that have large brains like us.</p>\n\n<p>Coming back to your relatives and their talking about you, you must remember that gossiping started its life as a good thing and that some experts in human psychology have argued that gossiping (also called exchange of ideas) is a normal human instinct that should not be suppressed.</p>\n\n<p>You may also want to think about the fact that most people gossip about people who have desirable characteristics that the gossiper does not have (a new boyfriend, a car, a house or even a new job).</p>\n\n<p>As your relatives continue to gossip about you, what is it that you do that they are jealous about? Also, why do you want them to stop admiring you? You must be doing something right!</p>\n\n<p>The only person who must not be in a position to spread what you call \u201cfalsehood\u201d about you is yourself. You must evaluate yourself and make sure that your judgement of yourself and self-worth is promotive of good mental health.</p>\n\n<p>Some people come to us because of low self-esteem. They feel that others are better off in one way or another. That, (coming back to your question), can be a sign of a mental illness such as depression.</p>\n\n<p>Happily for you as you have seen, relatives talking about you harshly and passing falsehood are acts of a 60,000-year-old attribute of human evolution. When you meet them again, give them what they need, a brief history of human and language development.</p>\n\n</article>", "canonicalUrl": "https://www.businessdailyafrica.com/bd/lifestyle/society/how-handle-those-meddlesome-relatives-3678806"},{"url": "https://www.businessdailyafrica.com/bd/lifestyle/health-fitness/good-oral-health-can-help-prevent-mental-illness-3679028", "probability": 0.9764065, "headline": "Good oral health can help prevent mental illness", "datePublished": "2022-01-11T21:00:00+00:00", "datePublishedRaw": "2022-01-11T21:00:00Z", "dateModified": "2022-01-11T14:46:17+00:00", "dateModifiedRaw": "2022-01-11T14:46:17Z", "author": "SARAH OOKO", "authorsList": ["SARAH OOKO"], "inLanguage": "en", "breadcrumbs": [{"name": "Home", "link": "https://www.businessdailyafrica.com/bd"}, {"name": "Lifestyle", "link": "https://www.businessdailyafrica.com/bd/lifestyle"}, {"name": "Health & Fitness", "link": "https://www.businessdailyafrica.com/bd/lifestyle/health-fitness"}], "mainImage": "https://www.businessdailyafrica.com/resource/blob/3679030/90c7ca99474790aa5c0360b64c0be7e9/dental-data.jpg", "description": "\nA majority of Kenyans brush at least once daily, so they can enjoy fresh breath and avoid stinking mouths.", "articleBody": "Dental hygiene is a matter that many people take for granted. A majority of Kenyans brush at least once daily, so they can enjoy fresh breath and avoid stinking mouths, which cause embarrassments during social interactions.\n\nEven though the motivation for brushing teeth among many people is to avoid foul breath, health experts note that this side effect is actually less severe, compared to other serious health ailments linked to poor oral health that most people are unaware of.\n\nFor instance, past studies have linked oral conditions due to bad hygiene - such as periodontitis (gum disease) - to an increase in diabetes and cardiovascular diseases such as hypertension or heart problems.\n\nMore recently, scientists have also discovered that poor oral health could be a contributor to mental health challenges which are increasingly on the rise globally.\n\nA new study published in the British Medical Journal (BMJ) indicates that there is an increased rate of patients developing mental ill-health and heart conditions if they have a medical history of gum disease.\n\nThe research was conducted by scientists from the universities of Oxford, Birmingham, Newcastle among other organisations based in the UK.\n\nThey analysed data of 64,379 patients who had a recorded history of gum disease and looked at their probability of developing cardiovascular disease as well as mental health conditions like depression and anxiety over a three-year period.\n\nThe results of the study showed that patients with a history of gum disease had an increased risk (37 percent) of developing mental problems compared to others that had not suffered from it.\n\nIn addition, the findings of the research showed that they were also more likely to develop the autoimmune and cardiovascular disease by 33 percent and 18 percent respectively.\n\n\u201cPoor oral health is extremely common globally.

It reinforces the importance of prevention, early identification and treatment of the condition, as well as the need for members of the public to attend regular oral health checks with a dentist or dental care professional,\u201d stated Dr Devan Raindi, a gum disease specialist at the University of Birmingham\u2019s School of Dentistry.\n\nIn Kenya, it is estimated that about one in every four people suffer from a mental health problem. Studies have shown that in health facilities, up to 25 percent and 40 percent of out-patients and in-patients respectively, suffer from mental conditions.\n\nThe influx in these cases has been linked to various causes such as substance abuse, economic challenges, conflicts, as well as violence in society.\n\nBut now, thanks to the findings of this new research, health experts advise that people should pay keen attention to their oral health as this could also go a long way in preventing mental health challenges.\n\nHeeding this call will require many Kenyans to 'pull up their sock' on oral health and begin taking it more seriously.\n\nBased on the World Health Organisation (WHO) guidelines, people are supposed to brush their teeth at least twice daily after meals, and especially before going to bed so as to maintain good oral hygiene.\n\nYet, Ministry of Health statistics from the 2015 Kenya Stepwise survey for non-communicable diseases found that whereas 89 percent of Kenyans clean their teeth once daily, only 36 percent do so twice daily.

Perhaps the greatest of these is the mobile phone and its associated auxiliaries such as application software.\n\nIt also helps a great deal that increased affordability of mobile phones has resulted in a greater than 100 percent mobile telephony penetration in sub \u2013 Saharan Africa.\n\nThis digitally progressive wave provides an immense opportunity for creative, out-of-the-box thinking in the entire spectra of healthcare products and services.\n\nIt also helps that a large number of funders now have an increased appetite for innovative approaches to solving long-standing healthcare challenges; particularly those that can be scaled up. It is a game of numbers!\n\nIn healthcare financing, mobile phones have become instrumental in increasing financial access to healthcare through various products that merge demand, supply and payment mechanisms.

An opportunity that China embraced by negotiating deals to fund infrastructure development with natural resources, a funding model that China perfected.\n\nThis is how infrastructure development and funding, became the hallmark of Chinese presence in Africa. This is when the West (-US, Europe) was preoccupied with the global war against terror to the extent of being blind to Chinese global expansion.\n\nThis was also the time when the West through the World Trade Organisation was advocating globalisation and liberalisation of trade, which further helped China\u2019s economic expansion, mostly through unfiltered access to western technologies, education and even capital.\n\nChina\u2019s economic emergence in Africa filled a vacuum created when the West rushed to invest in the new markets of post-cold war USSR and China. Africa was left to the mercy of Bretton Woods institutions and their difficult funding conditionalities.\n\nWhen US President Trump came to power, China was already a major global economic and geopolitical power having formed a formidable China/Russia/Iran economic and political alliance. When President Biden took office, he appeared more focused on Chinese global military ambitions, plus democracy and human rights- very opaque nouns to the Chinese leadership.\n\nChina has also been upping its global game to high-level diplomatic engagements, especially with those nations viewed to have problems with the West. There is every evidence of an emerging \u201ccold war\u201d between the West and China, and Africa is likely to be an unwilling pawn.\n\nIn Africa, the West is planning a late return after nearly 30 years of virtual absence in key areas of infrastructure development, control of strategic technology minerals, and an export market dominated by China. Recently military cooperation has been added to the Chinese shopping list in developing countries, further compounding the West\u2019s dilemma.\n\nAfrica has to navigate through the China vs West divide without having to painfully take sides in a cold war that is in the making. Africa is heavily indebted to China, and still has easy access to further Chinese development credit. Africa is also aware that the \u201cdebt capture\u201d can be used by China to coerce countries into geopolitical acquiescence.\n\nWe saw this happen last year when China restricted imports of coal from Australia over the mundane subject of the origins of Covid virus.\n\nAfrica can make best endeavours to diversify sources of infrastructure funds, including the use of public, private partnership (PPP) models popular with the West. Directionally, Africa should delink project funding from Engineering, Procurement and Construction (EPC) contracts to permit wider project participation. Further, Africa should embark on developing its own construction expertise and capacity to maximise local content and reduce dependence on foreign project contractors.\n\nTo correct existing huge trade imbalances, China should proactively make it easy to export African produce to its shores. Above all, African governments should protect local enterprises from unfair competition from Chinese imports.\n\nThere persists a major perceptions gap between China and Africa. First, China is conspicuously absent in humanitarian areas creating a perception of uncaring meanness. We need to see Chinese aid organisations working alongside JICA, USAID, DFID, GIZ and others.\n\nSecondly, China negotiates deals to significantly maximise gains for itself at the expense of weaker developing countries. These are unfortunate perceptions that China will need to correct to win genuine Africa friendship.\n\nMy observations are that China\u2019s Belt and Road Initiative has already reached the Middle East and is now looking for bridges across the Red Sea into Africa through the Horn of Africa by targeting existing links with Eritrea and Djibouti.

apparent retaliation against Dubai to ban all passenger flights from Kenya over fake Covid certificates.\n\nThe ban comes barely a few days after UAE extended the Kenya flight ban after it established that travellers from Nairobi were testing positive for Covid-19 on arrival in the Middle East nation, despite carrying negative test results.\n\nThe Ministry of Health is investigating the testing racket with a promise to punish health officials who were involved.\n\nBut even as the ministry takes action, Kenya and UAE must come back to the table and find more diplomatic ways to end the stalemate, which promises to hurt tourism and trade as well as inconvenience travellers.\n\nThe two countries must ensure that passengers travelling into their nations are fully vaccinated and seal all loopholes leading to the issuance of fake Covid tests.\n\nIt is worth noting that a ban on passenger travel is likely to see Emirates Airlines, as well as Kenya Airways #ticker:KQ, lose millions of shillings in passenger revenues.\n\nThe ban is also likely to deal a blow to the struggling aviation industry and even the countries image in the global war against the pandemic.",

Consequently, their month-to-month participation also shows a dip to less than 50 per cent (Q3, 2021) from a five year average of 64 per cent.\n\nNotably, turnover rate has also declined from 6.81 per cent (2017) to 3.6 per cent (H1 2021) while the NSE #ticker:NSE 20 Share Index has also lost an average of 10 per cent annually since 2017. There\u2019s one main question on investors' minds: what could be the driver of these large outflows?\n\nSeveral aspects come to mind, one of which you\u2019ve probably read from the headlines lamenting - the strong dollar is punishing stocks. There\u2019s an interpretation that a weak shilling indicates a lack of confidence in the Kenyan economy - the Shilling has lost almost eight per cent of its value since 2017.\n\nFrom a foreign investor\u2019s standpoint, a weaker shilling means the value of stock market investments are devalued by changes in currency exchange rates.\n\nIt\u2019s good to note that most foreign investors typically do not fully insure against FX risks on the grounds of cost and complexity. Thus, portfolio adjustments are made to protect from further weakness.\n\nTo add to this point, a weak shilling causes imports to be more expensive. With Kenya being a net importer, it means more expensive imports will have an outsized effect, making products more expensive, slowing growth and generally increasing inflation.\n\nAll these have a negative effect on the stock market rating, lowering PE ratios and raising earning yields.\n\nAnother possible reason would be the ongoing global uncertainties. Outflows are expected to increase given the key events such the Covid-19 and the monetary tightening by developed countries.\n\nThis year\u2019s most anticipated event is the expected hiking of rates (forecasted to be at least three strikes) by the US Fed including its plans to reduce the stimulus. One more factor is the increasing downgrades on emerging/frontier market securities.\n\nAs an example, last year Kenya's credit rating was downgraded to 'B' by Standard & Poor due to rising fiscal and external pressures. Regionally, 11 African countries were downgraded in the first half of 2020 and 12 had their outlooks changed to negative.\n\nInvestment bank, JP Morgan also recommended selling emerging market currencies with views shared by Morgan Stanley and CitiBank. As a result, investors have taken note of the deterioration of macroeconomic fundamentals (due to the impact of high-interest rates) and withdrawn their capital.\n\nIn summary, it was bound to happen. As the participation of international investors has increased over the years, their portfolio allocation decisions, now significant drivers of overall capital flow into Kenya\u2019s stock market, means we are vulnerable to these flows.\n\nCapital flow reversals are an integral part of international portfolio adjustment. But if the current situation worsens, it could further keep prices in a state of \u201cfunk\u201d.", "articleBodyHtml": "<article>\n\n<h2><a href=\"https://www.businessdailyafrica.com/bd/opinion-analysis/columnists\" title=\"Columnists\">Columnists</a></h2>\n\n<figure><img src=\"data:image/png;base64,iVBORw0KGgoAAAANSUhEUgAAAAEAAAABCAQAAAC1HAwCAAAAC0lEQVR42mNkYAAAAAYAAjCB0C8AAAAASUVORK5CYII=\" alt=\"col\" title=\"\" data-cm-responsive-media='[{\"name\":\"landscape_ratio16x9\",\"ratioWidth\":16,\"ratioHeight\":9,\"linksForWidth\":{\"200\":\"/resource/image/3678828/landscape_ratio16x9/200/112/f1bef97b453d53aa0eff4cb30808821/db/col.jpg\",\"300\":\"/resource/image/3678828/landscape_ratio16x9/300/168/f1bef97b453d53aa0eff4cb30808821/Xv/col.jpg\",\"400\":\"/resource/image/3678828/landscape_ratio16x9/400/225/f1bef97b453d53aa0eff4cb30808821/iO/col.jpg\",\"1160\":\"/resource/image/3678828/landscape_ratio16x9/1160/652/f1bef97b453d53aa0eff4cb30808821/eG/col.jpg\"}},{\"name\":\"portrait_ratio2x3\",\"ratioWidth\":2,\"ratioHeight\":3,\"linksForWidth\":{\"200\":\"/resource/image/3678828/portrait_ratio2x3/200/300/d771b484ef74f70668005dc5e199fd0/VA/col.jpg\",\"400\":\"/resource/image/3678828/portrait_ratio2x3/400/600/d771b484ef74f70668005dc5e199fd0/pV/col.jpg\",\"768\":\"/resource/image/3678828/portrait_ratio2x3/768/1152/d771b484ef74f70668005dc5e199fd0/zx/col.jpg\"}},{\"name\":\"landscape_ratio2x1\",\"ratioWidth\":2,\"ratioHeight\":1,\"linksForWidth\":{\"200\":\"/resource/image/3678828/landscape_ratio2x1/200/100/a68e977b60343c43600a743cd7320d73/Ng/col.jpg\"}},{\"name\":\"landscape_ratio3x2\",\"ratioWidth\":3,\"ratioHeight\":2,\"linksForWidth\":{\"300\":\"/resource/image/3678828/landscape_ratio3x2/300/200/ca88e2476d1d4451028469ed8c75e834/pL/col.jpg\",\"400\":\"/resource/image/3678828/landscape_ratio3x2/400/267/ca88e2476d1d4451028469ed8c75e834/jB/col.jpg\",\"768\":\"/resource/image/3678828/landscape_ratio3x2/768/512/ca88e2476d1d4451028469ed8c75e834/nr/col.jpg\"}},{\"name\":\"portrait_ratio1x1\",\"ratioWidth\":1,\"ratioHeight\":1,\"linksForWidth\":{\"50\":\"/resource/image/3678828/portrait_ratio1x1/50/50/12b51a612f7a5b2c0ffd7a41314cf9ef/ah/col.jpg\",\"60\":\"/resource/image/3678828/portrait_ratio1x1/60/60/12b51a612f7a5b2c0ffd7a41314cf9ef/Te/col.jpg\",\"200\":\"/resource/image/3678828/portrait_ratio1x1/200/200/12b51a612f7a5b2c0ffd7a41314cf9ef/MW/col.jpg\",\"400\":\"/resource/image/3678828/portrait_ratio1x1/400/400/12b51a612f7a5b2c0ffd7a41314cf9ef/xU/col.jpg\",\"768\":\"/resource/image/3678828/portrait_ratio1x1/768/768/12b51a612f7a5b2c0ffd7a41314cf9ef/Xt/col.jpg\"}},{\"name\":\"landscape_ratio4x3\",\"ratioWidth\":4,\"ratioHeight\":3,\"linksForWidth\":{\"200\":\"/resource/image/3678828/landscape_ratio4x3/200/150/e8130af191c0390bc3527bb236479d85/bg/col.jpg\",\"400\":\"/resource/image/3678828/landscape_ratio4x3/400/300/e8130af191c0390bc3527bb236479d85/cr/col.jpg\",\"768\":\"/resource/image/3678828/landscape_ratio4x3/768/576/e8130af191c0390bc3527bb236479d85/ZH/col.jpg\"}}]'></figure>\n\n<p>Since 2017, foreign portfolio investors have been net sellers in the market except for 2019 when they were net buyers.</p>\n\n<p>Cumulatively, in the five years, they have pulled out nearly Sh64 billion or over half a billion dollars from the local market.

"\nSince the advent of devolution in 2013, the national government has been embroiled in disputes with county governments over control of regional development authorities.", "articleBody": "Data Hub\n\nSince the advent of devolution in 2013, the national government has been embroiled in disputes with county governments over control of regional development authorities (RDAs).\n\nAfter going through never-ending wrangling, the Council of Governors (CoG) sued six development authorities and the Attorney-General, seeking a declaration that integrated planning, coordination and implementation of projects and programmes is a function of county governments.\n\nThey also wanted part of the law governing the authorities\u2019 establishment and functions to be declared unconstitutional.\n\nThe six development authorities\u2014Lake Basin, Kerio Valley, Tana and Athi River, Ewaso Ng\u2019iro South River, Coast and Ewaso Ng\u2019iro North River Basin\u2014control huge resources and are key in shaping the socio-economic fortunes in their spheres of operation.\n\nTo end this push and pull between devolved units and RDAs, the Ministry of East African Community & Regional Development is now working on a Regional Development Policy 2021 (RDP 2021), which Cabinet Secretary Adan Mohammed says will end the fight over these authorities.\n\nAccording to Mr Mohammed, the policy, which is currently at the public participation stage, will ensure that effective planning, coordination and monitoring of the exploitation and management of the natural resources in Kenya.\n\nIt will also help in obtaining sustainable socio-economic development in the regions and the country at large.\n\n\u201cFollowing the promulgation of the Constitution of Kenya 2010, some activities that were being undertaken by the RDAs were devolved to the County Governments, and therefore the Regional Development Policy is aligned to this development,\u201d said the CS.\n\nHe says that the policy aims at resolving the contentious issue of clashing of roles between RDAs and counties as well as weed out duplication of functions.\n\n\u201cThe overall goal of this Policy is to provide a framework to achieve sustainable utilisation and management of natural resources to spur harmonious, equitable and sustainable socio-economic development across the regions,\u201d Mr Mohammed said.\n\nLake Basin Development Authority chairman Odoyo Owidi says both the counties and RDAs have to work together in achieving various development projects hence there is no need of clashing and duplication.\n\n\u201cJust like county governments, RDAs get their funds from the national government hence there is no need for fighting and that is why we have come up with this policy which will harmonise our activities with those of devolved units,\u201d he said.\n\nThe county chiefs have consistently called for the scrapping of the parastatals whose roles overlap those of the devolved units, and their multi-billion-shilling budgetary allocation given to counties.\n\nThey variously point to the Presidential Taskforce on Parastatal Reforms (PTPRs) report that was released in November 2013, and which recommended that parastatals be reduced from 262 to 187.\n\nThe task force said 42 parastatals \u2014 mostly in the agricultural sector \u2014 should be dissolved, 28 merged and 22 others have their roles transferred to other institutions. Some 21 agencies were to be reclassified as professional bodies.\n\nThe idea was to rationalise the operations of the state-owned enterprises by removing overlaps, duplication and redundancies to eliminate wastage of public funds, enhance efficiency and bolster productivity.\n\nMost of these affected bodies are still around today, however, and very much aligned to the national government.\n\nAccording to Mr Mohammed, the new policy review is looking to redefine the treatment of these authorities at the national government level. It takes a view of the important role Nairobi plays in the management of basin-based resources if only to ensure that RDAs function optimally.\n\nIn a move to ensure that the RDAs execute their mandate efficiently and effectively, the Ministry recommends that a review of the Acts governing the RDAs be carried out, to align their functions with the Constitution of Kenya 2010 and also to develop supporting regulations.\n\n\u201cAs the RDAs were established before the coming into force of the constitution there is need to review the legislations establishing the RDAs to realign their functions to discharge the national government functions as per the constitution. In addition, regulations are required to enable the effective carrying of the mandates, powers and functions performed by the RDAs,\u201d reads the draft policy in part.\n\nThe policy also proposes coming up with a framework for planning, coordination and implementation of National integrated and multipurpose region-wide development projects and programmes.\n\nOther policy objectives include Mainstream climate change resilience, mitigation and adaptation initiatives and other cross-cutting issues in the basin-based development, establishing basin-based research and development framework and an institutional framework for efficient basin-based development.", "articleBodyHtml": "<article>\n\n<h2><a href=\"https://www.businessdailyafrica.com/bd/data-hub\" title=\"Data Hub\">Data Hub</a></h2>\n\n<figure><img src=\"data:image/png;base64,iVBORw0KGgoAAAANSUhEUgAAAAEAAAABCAQAAAC1HAwCAAAAC0lEQVR42mNkYAAAAAYAAjCB0C8AAAAASUVORK5CYII=\" alt=\"gov\" title=\"\" data-cm-responsive-media='[{\"name\":\"landscape_ratio16x9\",\"ratioWidth\":16,\"ratioHeight\":9,\"linksForWidth\":{\"200\":\"/resource/image/3679068/landscape_ratio16x9/200/112/f103b97a61edca32d929c2aeae19a5fe/GE/gov.jpg\",\"300\":\"/resource/image/3679068/landscape_ratio16x9/300/168/f103b97a61edca32d929c2aeae19a5fe/sI/gov.jpg\",\"400\":\"/resource/image/3679068/landscape_ratio16x9/400/225/f103b97a61edca32d929c2aeae19a5fe/BP/gov.jpg\",\"1160\":\"/resource/image/3679068/landscape_ratio16x9/1160/652/f103b97a61edca32d929c2aeae19a5fe/KT/gov.jpg\"}},{\"name\":\"portrait_ratio2x3\",\"ratioWidth\":2,\"ratioHeight\":3,\"linksForWidth\":{\"200\":\"/resource/image/3679068/portrait_ratio2x3/200/300/4bb169a5c372d2a50990f1552dfa5285/Hx/gov.jpg\",\"400\":\"/resource/image/3679068/portrait_ratio2x3/400/600/4bb169a5c372d2a50990f1552dfa5285/Qy/gov.jpg\",\"768\":\"/resource/image/3679068/portrait_ratio2x3/768/1152/4bb169a5c372d2a50990f1552dfa5285/Pq/gov.jpg\"}},{\"name\":\"landscape_ratio2x1\",\"ratioWidth\":2,\"ratioHeight\":1,\"linksForWidth\":{\"200\":\"/resource/image/3679068/landscape_ratio2x1/200/100/f3e89e0cf361d713033bcd1685be5882/QJ/gov.jpg\"}},{\"name\":\"landscape_ratio3x2\",\"ratioWidth\":3,\"ratioHeight\":2,\"linksForWidth\":{\"300\":\"/resource/image/3679068/landscape_ratio3x2/300/200/6fb09037c23f1bfd55105ec14adeae01/CY/gov.jpg\",\"400\":\"/resource/image/3679068/landscape_ratio3x2/400/267/6fb09037c23f1bfd55105ec14adeae01/Ee/gov.jpg\",\"768\":\"/resource/image/3679068/landscape_ratio3x2/768/512/6fb09037c23f1bfd55105ec14adeae01/Mo/gov.jpg\"}},{\"name\":\"portrait_ratio1x1\",\"ratioWidth\":1,\"ratioHeight\":1,\"linksForWidth\":{\"50\":\"/resource/image/3679068/portrait_ratio1x1/50/50/7cbd4b4dc8710c8121193fa35b17c9f5/YQ/gov.jpg\",\"60\":\"/resource/image/3679068/portrait_ratio1x1/60/60/7cbd4b4dc8710c8121193fa35b17c9f5/HV/gov.jpg\",\"200\":\"/resource/image/3679068/portrait_ratio1x1/200/200/7cbd4b4dc8710c8121193fa35b17c9f5/lp/gov.jpg\",\"400\":\"/resource/image/3679068/portrait_ratio1x1/400/400/7cbd4b4dc8710c8121193fa35b17c9f5/LT/gov.jpg\",\"768\":\"/resource/image/3679068/portrait_ratio1x1/768/768/7cbd4b4dc8710c8121193fa35b17c9f5/aY/gov.jpg\"}},{\"name\":\"landscape_ratio4x3\",\"ratioWidth\":4,\"ratioHeight\":3,\"linksForWidth\":{\"200\":\"/resource/image/3679068/landscape_ratio4x3/200/150/fe803aac12bfd501c03c9353477ca3b2/Yl/gov.jpg\",\"400\":\"/resource/image/3679068/landscape_ratio4x3/400/300/fe803aac12bfd501c03c9353477ca3b2/iM/gov.jpg\",\"768\":\"/resource/image/3679068/landscape_ratio4x3/768/576/fe803aac12bfd501c03c9353477ca3b2/jI/gov.jpg\"}}]'>\n\n<figcaption><p>Council of Governors (CoG) Chairman Martin Wambora.

It takes a view of the important role Nairobi plays in the management of basin-based resources if only to ensure that RDAs function optimally.</p>\n\n<p>In a move to ensure that the RDAs execute their mandate efficiently and effectively, the Ministry recommends that a review of the Acts governing the RDAs be carried out, to align their functions with the Constitution of Kenya 2010 and also to develop supporting regulations.</p>\n\n<p>\u201cAs the RDAs were established before the coming into force of the constitution there is need to review the legislations establishing the RDAs to realign their functions to discharge the national government functions as per the constitution. In addition, regulations are required to enable the effective carrying of the mandates, powers and functions performed by the RDAs,\u201d reads the draft policy in part.</p>\n\n<p>The policy also proposes coming up with a framework for planning, coordination and implementation of National integrated and multipurpose region-wide development projects and programmes.</p>\n\n<p>Other policy objectives include Mainstream climate change resilience, mitigation and adaptation initiatives and other cross-cutting issues in the basin-based development, establishing basin-based research and development framework and an institutional framework for efficient basin-based development.</p>\n\n</article>", "canonicalUrl": "https://www.businessdailyafrica.com/bd/data-hub/new-policy-aims-to-end-development-agencies-3679060"},{"url": "https://www.businessdailyafrica.com/bd/data-hub/data-shows-extent-unequal-water-supply-in-nairobi-3679050", "probability": 0.97037125, "headline": "Data shows extent of unequal water supply in Nairobi", "datePublished": "2022-01-11T21:00:00+00:00", "datePublishedRaw": "2022-01-11T21:00:00Z", "dateModified": "2022-01-11T14:59:40+00:00", "dateModifiedRaw": "2022-01-11T14:59:40Z", "inLanguage": "en", "breadcrumbs": [{"name": "Home", "link": "https://www.businessdailyafrica.com/bd"}, {"name": "Data Hub", "link": "https://www.businessdailyafrica.com/bd/data-hub"}], "mainImage": "https://www.businessdailyafrica.com/resource/blob/3679054/5efb51045a58577160794cc770d83e18/water-data.jpg", "description": "\nMany African cities struggle to supply safe, potable water to their residents. ", "articleBody": "Data Hub\n\nMany African cities struggle to supply safe, potable water to their residents. One of the main reasons for this is urbanisation; cities\u2019 populations grow rapidly as more people move to them from rural areas. Another reason, in some regions, is water scarcity.\n\nResearchers have long suspected that informal urban neighbourhoods are lagging behind their formal counterparts when it comes to accessing safe drinking water. But this reality can be obscured when data is aggregated to city-scale rather than being examined at a granular, localised level.\n\nNumerous studies have been conducted to examine inequalities in safe water access. Most measure this access through source type, such as access to tap water. Some have incorporated other dimensions of water service delivery, notably water quality. However, relatively few studies have examined intra-urban differences in the volumes of water consumed.\n\nIn our study in the Kenyan capital, Nairobi, we examined patterns of domestic piped water distribution between 1985 and 2018.\n\nWe used data from Nairobi\u2019s water and sewerage utility using small areas they call \u201citineraries\u201d. These have an average population of 700.\n\nWe also examined granular population data from the WorldPop mapping initiative and we drew on spatial data about the age of different neighbourhoods for the years between 1975 and 2014 from the Global Human Settlement project.\n\nThis data allowed us to examine differences between neighbourhoods insufficient domestic water consumption, cost, and water access. Crucially, we could examine changes over time. The data revealed that newly developed low-income urban neighbourhoods \u2013 home to up to a third of Nairobi\u2019s population \u2013 are not as well serviced as older, wealthier and less densely populated areas.\n\nOur hope is that these findings may influence governance and policy in the water sector. Water supply must be reliable, safe and affordable to everyone who lives in Nairobi.\n\nKey findings\n\nThe data showed that water sufficiency in Nairobi differs according to several factors. These include the age of a neighbourhood, income level, type of water access and the size of the population per itinerary.\n\nThe World Health Organisation (WHO) recommends at least 1500 litres of water per individual per month for domestic use. We found that residents in high- and middle-income areas were six and four times more likely to receive 1500 litres. Less densely populated areas were more likely to receive higher volumes of water.\n\nThe manner in which people access water differs according to income, too. People in high- and middle-income areas tend to have piped connections in their homes. Those in middle to low and low-income areas were more often getting water from communal taps or water kiosks (water vendors who sell water purchased from the utility company).\n\nWe also found that a great deal of water \u2013 an average of 3.5 billion litres per month \u2013 is being wasted either through burst pipes, theft or irregular meters. This is more than twice the amount of water needed for every one of the city\u2019s residents, across all areas, to access the recommended 1500 litres a month.\n\nTackling the problem\n\nThere are three ways to address the spatial inequality of water access in Nairobi: good data to plan water services and tariffs, investing in infrastructure, and governance.\n\nData on water supply and consumption is key in assessing the gaps in the water distribution process. It can also help to ensure better management of sometimes scarce or limited water supplies. Historically, government data has been poorly stored.\n\nHowever, there have been positive improvements in this regard as governments increasingly ensure that their data is accessible, electronically stored, complete and consistent. This enables research and future planning. Kenya has digitised the water consumption data and made the water tariff structure publicly available.\n\nGood governance\n\nImproving water sufficiency will also require the right investments from the government. Growth in city population should be accompanied by investments in infrastructure to support the provision of safe water to the population \u2013 including proper funding of water utility companies to enhance their performance.\n\nInvestments should be organised based on residential category and neighbourhood age, with a focus on the groups the data shows are not being well serviced.\n\nFinally, good governance is required to minimise both water losses and social inequalities. There should be a deliberate prioritisation of water supply and infrastructure development in low-income areas, both in newer and older neighbourhoods and in densely populated areas.\n\nThis is critical if Kenya is to achieve the water access targets outlined in the African Union\u2019s Agenda 2063 and the 2030 United Nations\u2019 Sustainable Development Goals.", "articleBodyHtml": "<article>\n\n<h4><a href=\"https://www.businessdailyafrica.com/bd/data-hub\" title=\"Data Hub\">Data Hub</a></h4>\n\n<figure><img src=\"data:image/png;base64,iVBORw0KGgoAAAANSUhEUgAAAAEAAAABCAQAAAC1HAwCAAAAC0lEQVR42mNkYAAAAAYAAjCB0C8AAAAASUVORK5CYII=\" alt=\"water\" title=\"\" data-cm-responsive-media='[{\"name\":\"landscape_ratio16x9\",\"ratioWidth\":16,\"ratioHeight\":9,\"linksForWidth\":{\"200\":\"/resource/image/3679054/landscape_ratio16x9/200/112/c85416ce13ddce0059fe85b2bfb7730a/ht/water.jpg\",\"300\":\"/resource/image/3679054/landscape_ratio16x9/300/168/c85416ce13ddce0059fe85b2bfb7730a/DR/water.jpg\",\"400\":\"/resource/image/3679054/landscape_ratio16x9/400/225/c85416ce13ddce0059fe85b2bfb7730a/HM/water.jpg\",\"1160\":\"/resource/image/3679054/landscape_ratio16x9/1160/652/c85416ce13ddce0059fe85b2bfb7730a/qo/water.jpg\"}},{\"name\":\"portrait_ratio2x3\",\"ratioWidth\":2,\"ratioHeight\":3,\"linksForWidth\":{\"200\":\"/resource/image/3679054/portrait_ratio2x3/200/300/1cca34decf6fcf4f6eb293491dda59e6/il/water.jpg\",\"400\":\"/resource/image/3679054/portrait_ratio2x3/400/600/1cca34decf6fcf4f6eb293491dda59e6/VO/water.jpg\",\"768\":\"/resource/image/3679054/portrait_ratio2x3/768/1152/1cca34decf6fcf4f6eb293491dda59e6/Ce/water.jpg\"}},{\"name\":\"landscape_ratio2x1\",\"ratioWidth\":2,\"ratioHeight\":1,\"linksForWidth\":{\"200\":\"/resource/image/3679054/landscape_ratio2x1/200/100/d75aa3ff93c64bd80edd7efaffbc20b9/yS/water.jpg\"}},{\"name\":\"landscape_ratio3x2\",\"ratioWidth\":3,\"ratioHeight\":2,\"linksForWidth\":{\"300\":\"/resource/image/3679054/landscape_ratio3x2/300/200/7fb7a59ae166136bbc08637f042e5129/uz/water.jpg\",\"400\":\"/resource/image/3679054/landscape_ratio3x2/400/267/7fb7a59ae166136bbc08637f042e5129/rd/water.jpg\",\"768\":\"/resource/image/3679054/landscape_ratio3x2/768/512/7fb7a59ae166136bbc08637f042e5129/Ej/water.jpg\"}},{\"name\":\"portrait_ratio1x1\",\"ratioWidth\":1,\"ratioHeight\":1,\"linksForWidth\":{\"50\":\"/resource/image/3679054/portrait_ratio1x1/50/50/8913e14f29d31d82d612738057e132e7/lp/water.jpg\",\"60\":\"/resource/image/3679054/portrait_ratio1x1/60/60/8913e14f29d31d82d612738057e132e7/ta/water.jpg\",\"200\":\"/resource/image/3679054/portrait_ratio1x1/200/200/8913e14f29d31d82d612738057e132e7/re/water.jpg\",\"400\":\"/resource/image/3679054/portrait_ratio1x1/400/400/8913e14f29d31d82d612738057e132e7/cM/water.jpg\",\"768\":\"/resource/image/3679054/portrait_ratio1x1/768/768/8913e14f29d31d82d612738057e132e7/tp/water.jpg\"}},{\"name\":\"landscape_ratio4x3\",\"ratioWidth\":4,\"ratioHeight\":3,\"linksForWidth\":{\"200\":\"/resource/image/3679054/landscape_ratio4x3/200/150/58ac0282634458758b74ce2e8bd8dd3e/ri/water.jpg\",\"400\":\"/resource/image/3679054/landscape_ratio4x3/400/300/58ac0282634458758b74ce2e8bd8dd3e/qV/water.jpg\",\"768\":\"/resource/image/3679054/landscape_ratio4x3/768/576/58ac0282634458758b74ce2e8bd8dd3e/ml/water.jpg\"}}]'>\n\n<figcaption><p>An NMS water supply point in Southlands Kijiji in Lang'ata on August 25, 2021.

The rest are held by other institutions and individuals.\n\nOn the other hand, NIC was owned by the Ndegwa family through First Chartered Securities with 15.84 percent, ICEA Asset Management Ltd, also partly owned by the family, had 9.16 percent and Livingstone Registrars with 8.73 percent among other\n\nThis saw a link between two big families and the same investor on the entity.\n\nNCBA chief executive John Gachora has dismissed critics who attribute its meteoric rise to the current regime.\n\nMr Gachora says the biggest investment is in digital lending where the bank has cast its nets to serve over 50 million customers, making NCBA Group the largest banking entity in Africa.\n\nHaving combined with a big asset financier, NCBA has emerged as one of the biggest beneficiaries in infrastructural and private construction projects, and asset financing.\n\nThe lender, listed on the Nairobi Securities Exchange, is the fourth-largest in Kenya with a Sh562.63 billion asset base in the nine months to September, an 8.4 percent growth compared to a similar period last year.\n\nIt follows Equity Group #ticker:EQTY (Sh1.18 trillion) as the pacemaker, KCB Group #ticker:KCB (Sh1.12 trillion) and Co-op Group #ticker:COOP (Sh592.89 billion.)\n\nThe merger resulted in more than doubling of net earnings in 2019 at Sh7.84 billion, from Sh3.24 billion registered by NIC Bank in 2013, which held 4.17 percent market share while CBA Bank was at 5.12 percent at the time.\n\nNCBA had a market share of 9.7 percent by December last year, dropping from 10.1 percent in 2019 due to pandemic. The lender reported Sh4.57 billion in net profit that year.\n\nThe Kenyattas have a 13.2 percent stake in NCBA while the family of the late Phillip Ndegwa owns 11.75 percent.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s important to note we are two-year-old. Two years ago there was no NCBA,\u201d said Mr Gachora in an interview with Business Daily, adding that the bank is no government favourite.\n\n\u201cIt would be true if we were banking the government. If you look at our customer base it\u2019s not government as you would see in other banks. We have never seen a directive saying open an account at NCBA...\u201d\n\nHe also credits the growth to a good brand, strategic growth and its workforce.\n\n\u201cToday the bank is known everywhere in Kenya and East Africa. There is also brand beauty that we have done. A lot of work and investment has gone to that.\u201d\n\nThe bank recruited 340 staff this year out of which 220 are permanent employees, almost overturning a lay-off move last year. The lender has opened seven new branches in Nyeri, Karatina, Embu, Ruiru, Kakamega, Bungoma, and Kericho this year.\n\nIt planned to open 15 branches in 2021 to be utilised as sales points, advisory, brand visibility and seller.\n\nThe lender also seeks to expand its operations with physical branches in Kiambu, Ngong, Naivasha and Gikomba, to increase customer base and deposits mobilisation targeting the retail and SME clients.\n\nThe lender spent Sh742 million on a voluntary early retirement programme in 2020 that saw the exit of 130 employees amid the pandemic.\n\nThe recruitment has pushed the staff costs up by 10.8 percent to Sh5.89 billion compared to a similar period last year.\n\nThe bank has been focused on lending through digital products including Fuliza, Mshwari and Loop, minting revenues through fees and interest, just like most local banks.\n\nThe bank lent over Sh423 billion in the nine months to September through Fuliza (Sh346 billion) Mshwari (Sh66) and the rest distributed between Loop, Mokash Uganda, Mokash Rwanda and M-Pawa in Tanzania.\n\n\u201cDigital lending is important to us in a number of ways. From a financial perspective, it is quite remunerating. We get to play a role in financial inclusion.\n\nThere are savings from people who put aside small amounts like Sh30 to Sh3,000 from small businesses, beginners and even college students, giving us a lot of satisfaction,\u201d he adds.\n\nThe bank has partnered with South African-based telco firm MTN in Ivory Coast and Bridge Bank to dominate in some markets outside Kenya.\n\nMr Gachora said they are still looking for other partnerships in Africa.\n\n\u201cFrom a digital perspective, we are always looking for partnerships.

However, a wind of change is sweeping across the region with farmers embracing export crops like avocado as maize farming becomes less profitable in the wake of the high cost of production.\n\nAfter incurring losses resulting from high production costs and low returns on maize cultivation, Kevin Koimat decided to try his luck on the avocado to improve his earnings.\n\nThe 27-year-old petroleum engineer could only make Sh25,000 from an acre of maize after waiting for a year. For him, the maize venture was no longer attractive in the wake of lucrative avocado farming that is now gaining traction in the North Rift.\n\nIn 2017, Mr Koimat shifted to avocado cultivation after learning from other farmers and receiving some training in the production of this fruit from export firm Habex Agro Limited, which is at the moment signing a 10-year purchase contract with farmers.\n\nIn the first year of harvesting, the young farmer earned Sh50,000 from three-quarters of an acre of land with production starting earlier than expected.\n\nNormally, the yielding of this fruit starts at three years but with good agronomic practices, they can start at 24 months.\n\n\u201cWith avocado, I harvest twice a year and earn twice what I could get from maize, I do not regret having shifted from maize to this crop,\u201d said Mr Koimat, a farmer in Uasin Gishu.\n\nMr Koimat, who is the face of young farmers in the region, says one of the biggest challenges that they face in their farming activities is convincing their old folks to give them land for an alternative crop.\n\n\u201cIt took time to convince my mother to give me some land for avocado farming as she still believed in maize farming,\u201d said the farmer.\n\nHowever, after seeing the first harvest and returns from avocado, his mother has now agreed to give him more land to scale up his avocado venture.\n\nMr Koimat is just one of the many farmers who have shifted from growing maize to avocado on a large, medium and small scale.\n\nReturns from avocado are substantially higher than earnings from maize or wheat. For instance, a grower would comfortably make a net of Sh600,000 per annum from an acre of the avocado when the fruit attains peak yields, returns that will take a maize farmer years to earn.\n\nMicah Cheserem, chairman and the owner of Equator Flowers Kenya Limited, says avocado is the surest way of alleviating poverty among farmers, which has been occasioned by reliance on maize.\n\nMr Cheserem, who has put more than 200 acres of land under the avocado and plans to add more in the coming years, started fruit farming in 2017 as he diversifies from the rose flower.\n\n\u201cWe should stop relying on maize and turn to other value crops that bring not only good but reliable income to farmers,\u201d said Mr Cheserem, the former governor of the Central Bank of Kenya.\n\nEquator has opened a state-of-the-art academy in Uasin Gishu where farmers will undergo training in growing avocado.\n\nThe initial training will be free but farmers will start paying after some time.

This has made it easy for producers to obtain the planting material with much ease.\n\n\u201cOur terms have been very good to the farmers and despite signing a 10-year contract, the price that we give is what is in the market at a given time.

However, a wind of change is sweeping across the region with farmers embracing export crops like avocado as maize farming becomes less profitable in the wake of the high cost of production.</p>\n\n<p>After incurring losses resulting from high production costs and low returns on maize cultivation, Kevin Koimat decided to try his luck on the avocado to improve his earnings.</p>\n\n<p>The 27-year-old petroleum engineer could only make Sh25,000 from an acre of maize after waiting for a year. For him, the maize venture was no longer attractive in the wake of lucrative avocado farming that is now gaining traction in the North Rift.</p>\n\n<p>In 2017, Mr Koimat shifted to avocado cultivation after learning from other farmers and receiving some training in the production of this fruit from export firm Habex Agro Limited, which is at the moment signing a 10-year purchase contract with farmers.</p>\n\n<p>In the first year of harvesting, the young farmer earned Sh50,000 from three-quarters of an acre of land with production starting earlier than expected.</p>\n\n<p>Normally, the yielding of this fruit starts at three years but with good agronomic practices, they can start at 24 months.</p>\n\n<p>\u201cWith avocado, I harvest twice a year and earn twice what I could get from maize, I do not regret having shifted from maize to this crop,\u201d said Mr Koimat, a farmer in Uasin Gishu.</p>\n\n<p>Mr Koimat, who is the face of young farmers in the region, says one of the biggest challenges that they face in their farming activities is convincing their old folks to give them land for an alternative crop.</p>\n\n<p>\u201cIt took time to convince my mother to give me some land for avocado farming as she still believed in maize farming,\u201d said the farmer.</p>\n\n<p>However, after seeing the first harvest and returns from avocado, his mother has now agreed to give him more land to scale up his avocado venture.</p>\n\n<p>Mr Koimat is just one of the many farmers who have shifted from growing maize to avocado on a large, medium and small scale.</p>\n\n<p>Returns from avocado are substantially higher than earnings from maize or wheat. For instance, a grower would comfortably make a net of Sh600,000 per annum from an acre of the avocado when the fruit attains peak yields, returns that will take a maize farmer years to earn.</p>\n\n<p>Micah Cheserem, chairman and the owner of Equator Flowers Kenya Limited, says avocado is the surest way of alleviating poverty among farmers, which has been occasioned by reliance on maize.</p>\n\n<p>Mr Cheserem, who has put more than 200 acres of land under the avocado and plans to add more in the coming years, started fruit farming in 2017 as he diversifies from the rose flower.</p>\n\n<p>\u201cWe should stop relying on maize and turn to other value crops that bring not only good but reliable income to farmers,\u201d said Mr Cheserem, the former governor of the Central Bank of Kenya.</p>\n\n<p>Equator has opened a state-of-the-art academy in Uasin Gishu where farmers will undergo training in growing avocado.</p>\n\n<p>The initial training will be free but farmers will start paying after some time. Those who will be trained will also have an opportunity to acquire avocado seedlings from the firm\u2019s nursery and sell fruits to the company once their crop matures.</p>\n\n<p>Equator plans to open a value-addition plant as it seeks to start a direct export market in the near future and that is the reason why it is building farmers\u2019 capacity to get more supplies from the outgrowers to meet the requisite export volumes.</p>\n\n<p>The North Rift region has unique harvesting seasons in the country, making the avocados from this region earn farmers a premium price as it comes to the market when all other regions are done with harvesting.</p>\n\n<p>\u201cOur harvesting season runs from July to October when the demand for the produce is very high in the market,\u201d said Norah Cheserem, a director at Equator.</p>\n\n<p>The demand for seedlings has outstripped the supply with counties and private nurseries working round the clock to ensure they have enough to meet farmers\u2019 needs.</p>\n\n<p>Antonina Lutta, senior horticulture officer, Horticulture Crops Directorate (HCD) says the challenge with the growing of avocado, especially in the North Rift where the venture is still new, is getting clean material.</p>\n\n<p>\u201cClean planting materials has been a challenge, especially in the Rift Valley region where avocado farming is new,\u201d said Ms Lutta.</p>\n\n<p>The officer said there, however, have been efforts by the directorate to licence private nurseries that are now offering high-quality seedlings to the farmers.</p>\n\n<p>Ms Lutta said the challenge has been with the roadside nurseries that are selling low-quality seedlings to the farmers, adding that counties and other State agencies have stepped up efforts to regulate the market.</p>\n\n<p>\u201cWe insist on regulated nurseries because of traceability issues, which is important not only to the farmer but also the consumer, hence the need to ensure planting materials are clean,\u201d she said.</p>\n\n<p>Uasin Gishu County chief executive committee member for Agriculture Samuel Yego said there has been a shift in the region that has for years been renowned for maize farming as growers now seek high-value crops to increase their earnings.</p>\n\n<p>Mr Yego said the trend in maize was precipitated by the high cost of planting maize, declined earnings and unpredictable market.</p>\n\n<p>\u201cThere has been a shift in the recent years as more farmers move from maize and wheat to high-value crop,\u201d said Mr Yego.</p>\n\n<p>He said, for instance, the cost of planting wheat has in recent years gone up drastically because of the fungi infection that has become notorious in the region.</p>\n\n<p>This has forced farmers to spray their farms several times even as the cost of the fungicide has gone up due to the 16 percent duty charged on the chemical.</p>\n\n<p>\u201cIn the next one year, we do not want to be the breadbasket of maize alone but also of diversified high-value crops such as avocados,\u201d said the official.</p>\n\n<p>The county has now been promoting the export of high-value crops in the region and has over the years distributed seedlings for not only avocado but also other plants such as tissue culture banana, coffee and macadamia.</p>\n\n<p>He said the county has so far distributed 150,000 seedlings of avocado, more than 50,000 of tissue culture banana and 700,000 seedlings of coffee to farmers in Uasin Gishu.</p>\n\n<p>Whereas Mr Yego says maize is still crucial for the country because of food security, they are still keen to have farmers diversify to other crops.</p>\n\n<p>In Trans-Nzoia, the county has subsidised the fruit seedlings that it gives to farmers as it moves to attract more people into planting high-value crops.</p>\n\n<p>Trans Nzoia Agriculture CEC Mary Nzomo says the uptake of avocado in the county has been good over the last three years and that they are still sensitising more growers, especially the youth to join this venture.</p>\n\n<p>\u201cWe have been doing a serious campaign on avocado development in our county given that studies have shown that the environment here is good for this crop,\u201d she said.</p>\n\n<p>Dr Nzomo said the future of avocado in Trans Nzoia is bright, especially after farmers started harvesting the crop in 2020 and witnessed the returns.</p>\n\n<p>Habex Agro Limited has been giving farmers seedlings on credit with the cost recovered once the farmers start harvesting.

The monopoly did not publicly disclose what caused the fall of the towers, but insiders said earlier indications pointed to possible vandalism of the installation based at Nairobi\u2019s Imara Daima area.\n\n\u201cIt appears this is a case of vandalism, but this is not yet conclusive. The line is near a slum dwelling,\u201d the Kenya Power official said. \u201cYes, it is an old-line, but it has been very stable at least for the longest time I have been here.\u201d\n\nThe outage which was reported around 10.45 am took nearly four hours before being restored to parts of the country after repair works by the Kenya Power engineers.\n\nBy 5 pm, the utility said power had been restored to all parts of the country except Kitui, Mwingi and Garissa which it expected to reconnect supply by 6 pm.\n\nManufacturers, commercial building owners, warehouses, farmers and small businesses such as salons and barbershops largely depend on electricity to operate.\n\nAn extended outage usually leads to losses and additional expenses from using generators.\n\nFrequent blackouts due to supply shortfalls \u2014 and sometimes because of aging distribution and transmission infrastructure \u2014 have forced most businesses and wealthy homes to have standby generators.\n\n\u201cWhenever there\u2019s a fault on one of our major lines, it destabilises the entire network,\u201d the Kenya Power source said.\n\nThis is the third major countrywide blackout in recent years.\n\nMore than seven million customers were hit by a major early morning outage on May 9, 2020, following a fault on a section of a high-voltage line transmitting electricity to Nairobi from the Olkaria geothermal power plants near Naivasha.\n\nThe fault in May 2020, which also affected Uganda since the grids in the two countries are inter-connected, resulted in \u201cpower loss on the critical power line thus overloading the other power generators countrywide\u201d.\n\nA similar outage was reported on January 9, 2018, due to a \u201ctechnical hitch\u201d and also disrupted supply in Uganda.\n\nTuesday\u2019s blackout came barely two weeks after the state-controlled utility firm and Kenya Electricity Transmission Company restored power transmission from 310.25-megawatt Lake Turkana Wind Power (LTWP) on Loiyangalani line to the Suswa substation which had collapsed in December.\n\nThis had resulted in power rationing in some parts of the country, including Nairobi, during peak hours from 7 pm to 9.30 pm.\n\nThe latest data, however, suggests the frequency and longevity of blackouts have fallen in recent years.\n\nFor example, the average time customers were cut off power supply \u2014 technically referred to as Customer Average Interruption Duration Index (CAIDI) \u2014 dropped to 4.03 hours in the year ended June 2021 compared with 4.52 hours in the prior year.\n\n\u201cBy expeditiously addressing network outages and improving our system reliability in general, we managed to improve our sales by 34GWh, which is approximately Sh360 million in revenues,\u201d Kenya Power wrote an annual report for the period through June 2021.\n\nThe blackout came at a time the Energy and Petroleum Regulatory Authority (Epra) is seeking to compel electricity utilities to compensate consumers for financial losses, equipment damage, physical injuries and death due to power outages.\n\nCurrently, Kenya Power compensates for injuries and damaged kits but does not pay for financial loss as a result of being cut off the electricity supply.\n\nThe draft regulations will see Kenya adopt the model in most European countries that require utilities to compensate users whose homes and businesses are cut off from power for prolonged periods if they become law.\n\nIn 2015, the government rejected a proposed law that required Kenya Power to compensate businesses whose power is cut off for more than three hours within a day.\n\nThe Bill, which had been sponsored by Mvita MP Abdulswamad Nassir, had proposed that Kenya Power include the compensation in power bills and use it to offset future electricity costs.", "articleBodyHtml": "<article>\n\n<figure><img

third major countrywide blackout in recent years.</p>\n\n<p>More than seven million customers were hit by a major early morning outage on May 9, 2020, following a fault on a section of a high-voltage line transmitting electricity to Nairobi from the Olkaria geothermal power plants near Naivasha.</p>\n\n<p>The fault in May 2020, which also affected Uganda since the grids in the two countries are inter-connected, resulted in \u201cpower loss on the critical power line thus overloading the other power generators countrywide\u201d.</p>\n\n<p>A similar outage was reported on January 9, 2018, due to a \u201ctechnical hitch\u201d and also disrupted supply in Uganda.</p>\n\n<p>Tuesday\u2019s blackout came barely two weeks after the state-controlled utility firm and Kenya Electricity Transmission Company restored power transmission from 310.25-megawatt Lake Turkana Wind Power (LTWP) on Loiyangalani line to the Suswa substation which had collapsed in December.</p>\n\n<p>This had resulted in power rationing in some parts of the country, including Nairobi, during peak hours from 7 pm to 9.30 pm.</p>\n\n<p>The latest data, however, suggests the frequency and longevity of blackouts have fallen in recent years.</p>\n\n<p>For example, the average time customers were cut off power supply \u2014 technically referred to as Customer Average Interruption Duration Index (CAIDI) \u2014 dropped to 4.03 hours in the year ended June 2021 compared with 4.52 hours in the prior year.</p>\n\n<p>\u201cBy expeditiously addressing network outages and improving our system reliability in general, we managed to improve our sales by 34GWh, which is approximately Sh360 million in revenues,\u201d Kenya Power wrote an annual report for the period through June 2021.</p>\n\n<p>The blackout came at a time the Energy and Petroleum Regulatory Authority (Epra) is seeking to compel electricity utilities to compensate consumers for financial losses, equipment damage, physical injuries and death due to power outages.</p>\n\n<p>Currently, Kenya Power compensates for injuries and damaged kits but does not pay for financial loss as a result of being cut off the electricity supply.</p>\n\n<p>The draft regulations will see Kenya adopt the model in most European countries that require utilities to compensate users whose homes and businesses are cut off from power for prolonged periods if they become law.</p>\n\n<p>In 2015, the government rejected a proposed law that required Kenya Power to compensate businesses whose power is cut off for more than three hours within a day.</p>\n\n<p>The Bill, which had been sponsored by Mvita MP Abdulswamad Nassir, had proposed that Kenya Power include the compensation in power bills and use it to offset future electricity costs.</p>\n\n</article>", "canonicalUrl": "https://www.businessdailyafrica.com/bd/economy/kenya-power-confirms-nationwide-blackout-major-line-breaks-3678664"},{"url":

have informed Equity\u2019s strategy to target long term products.\n\nEquity has chosen life insurance which comprises Sh102 billion in annual premiums or 43.4 per cent per cent of the overall insurance business.\n\n\u201cOur market, however, is still general business driven and I call upon Equity Life Assurance to identify strategies of increasing insurance growth in the long-term business,\u201d IRA chief executive Godfrey Kiptum said.\n\nEquity\u2019s entry into insurance has been enabled by legal and regulatory changes that allowed lenders to go into non-banking businesses after undergoing the necessary corporate restructurings.\n\nMost of the big banks have transformed into non-operating holding companies which are free to own banking and non-banking subsidiaries.\n\nThe holding companies are, however, still regulated by the Central Bank of Kenya.\n\nEquity Group formed Equity Group Insurance Holdings Limited to house its underwriting business,

gauge railway (MGR).\n\nKRC managing director Philip Mainga said the trial runs on the newly constructed link connecting the SGR and the MGR at Naivasha started yesterday with a view to tighten all the loose ends before full operations can resume in the next two months.\n\nThe corporation is looking forward to offer end-to-end rail delivery of cargo from Mombasa to the Ugandan ports of Jinja and Port Bell through Kisumu port vessels, and the direct main line through Naivasha-Malaba-Kampala, which is ready for operation.\n\n\u201cOur clients will now enjoy seamless transportation of cargo from

in the year ended December 2020.", "articleBody": "Airtel Kenya\u2019s mobile money business made a profit of Sh79 million in the year ended December 2020, sharply contrasting with the company\u2019s voice division whose losses rose to Sh6 billion in the period.\n\nThe mobile money unit recorded revenue of Sh245 million in the period, the company\u2019s financial results show, and although expenses were higher at Sh282.3 million, it was able to turn a profit due to finance income of Sh37.5 million and a foreign exchange gain of Sh80.1 million.\n\nThe firm does not operate the mobile money unit as a separate entity, but Central Bank of Kenya (CBK) rules requires telcos to show the results of the mobile money businesses.\n\nThe voice business recorded revenues of Sh26.45 billion in the period, with the unit\u2019s loss after tax hitting Sh6.07 billion on the back of higher operating expenses and finance costs.\n\nThe profit of the Airtel Money unit, therefore, had only a marginal effect on the firm\u2019s total loss, which stood at Sh5.99 billion in 2020.\n\nAirtel\u2019s mobile money business also trails that of Safaricom by a wide margin, reflecting the financial benefit of the large market share advantage enjoyed by the country\u2019s leading telco.\n\nSafaricom #ticker:SCOM does not disclose the profit it makes from its mobile money platform M-Pesa but the figure runs into billions of shillings per annum, dwarfing Airtel Money\u2019s earnings.\n\nIn the year ended March 2021, Safaricom reported revenue of Sh82.7 billion from M-Pesa, which represented 31.3 percent of the company\u2019s total full-year sales of Sh264.03 billion.\n\nM-Pesa has more than 90 percent share of the mobile money market, with its 34.06 million active mobile subscribers accounting for 98.5 percent of the industry total.\n\nThe platform offers a wide range of financial services including cash transfers, credit and payments, entrenching its hold on customers from the many use cases and network effect.\n\nRival Telkom Kenya in November last year sought to have Parliament compel Safaricom cut the fees it charges on its M-Pesa service for cash transfers to rival platforms, claiming that high charges for these transfers discourage cross-platform money transfers that would lift the other networks\u2019 revenue performance.\n\nSafaricom in its submissions defended itself against the accusations that it is using its outsize market power to the detriment of rivals, saying that there was healthy competition in the industry and that any player could build its market share through increased investments and innovation.", "articleBodyHtml": "<article>\n\n<figure><img

I don\u2019t even know how people cope with it emotionally, where they find the resilience, or how they must feel each hungry day. But that the Covid pandemic and all the measures we lived through have made it worse, as reported this week, can come as no surprise.\n\nPollsters Geopoll put out poll results that showed earnings fell immediately the pandemic started, from April to July 2020, and then fell again and by much more from August to November of the same year.\n\nAs a consequence, villages filled up with former city residents, returning home as a safety net, with their jobs gone, or in retreat from the unmeetable sum of a cut salary coming in, but a city rent going out.\n\nBehind that migration sat city landlords with now empty income-less properties who were buying less, employing fewer. Closed offices dropped messengers and askari. The working from home hit matatus and SACCOs.\n\nIn the great swirling mass of interrupted activity that hit earnings everywhere, the only oddity of it all is that it didn\u2019t add up to a bigger overall economic contraction.\n\nKenya\u2019s GDP growth did fall from an expected 5.4 per cent in 2020 to a now adjusted contraction of 0.3 per cent, according to the World Bank, or 0.1 per cent, according to the IMF. But, either way, both tiny contractions, and hard to grasp as the outcome of so many dropped incomes: who was earning more to balance out all those everywhere losses?\n\nYet, in 2021, the consensus is that Kenyan GDP grew, and by more than 5 per cent.\n\nSo now we have a sheep and goats issue playing out: two types of businesses, two types of employers, two types of vision, and two types of relationships with stakeholders and staff \u2013 the ones who have restored salary levels, and the ones who have not.\n\nFor only some of the salary cuts of 2020 have ever been restored. For many, the 40 per cent or 50 per cent cut then, is a rate still in place in 2022.\n\nOf course, businesses have taken a hit. Hotels sat virtually empty, newspapers dropped advertisers, manufacturers sat idle on raw material hold ups, and sold less when they were producing. These are all losses.\n\nBut when an organisation that is a group of people in various functions takes a hit, there is a unique kind of destruction that can follow from it being the powerful who decide how the losses are distributed. That is especially so when those powerful decide that it is those with the least power and the fewest resources that will carry the can for everyone.\n\nSo, in those companies, the employees and casual workers are still paying back the losses that the whole organisation suffered from their own salaries, to maintain or improve returns to shareholders, or maintain the same price to customers.\n\nFor sure, in Kenya\u2019s culture, built as it is, every tendency is towards pushing the losses down to those with the least voice and the fewest alternatives.\n\nBut little wonder then, that people are leaving jobs as never before.

I don\u2019t even know how people cope with it emotionally, where they find the resilience, or how they must feel each hungry day. But that the Covid pandemic and all the measures we lived through have made it worse, as reported this week, can come as no surprise.</p>\n\n<p>Pollsters Geopoll put out poll results that showed earnings fell immediately the pandemic started, from April to July 2020, and then fell again and by much more from August to November of the same year.</p>\n\n<p>As a consequence, villages filled up with former city residents, returning home as a safety net, with their jobs gone, or in retreat from the unmeetable sum of a cut salary coming in, but a city rent going out.</p>\n\n<p>Behind that migration sat city landlords with now empty income-less properties who were buying less, employing fewer. Closed offices dropped messengers and askari. The working from home hit matatus and SACCOs.</p>\n\n<p>In the great swirling mass of interrupted activity that hit earnings everywhere, the only oddity of it all is that it didn\u2019t add up to a bigger overall economic contraction.</p>\n\n<p>Kenya\u2019s GDP growth did fall from an expected 5.4 per cent in 2020 to a now adjusted contraction of 0.3 per cent, according to the World Bank, or 0.1 per cent, according to the IMF. But, either way, both tiny contractions, and hard to grasp as the outcome of so many dropped incomes: who was earning more to balance out all those everywhere losses?</p>\n\n<p>Yet, in 2021, the consensus is that Kenyan GDP grew, and by more than 5 per cent.</p>\n\n<p>So now we have a sheep and goats issue playing out: two types of businesses, two types of employers, two types of vision, and two types of relationships with stakeholders and staff \u2013 the ones who have restored salary levels, and the ones who have not.</p>\n\n<p>For only some of the salary cuts of 2020 have ever been restored. For many, the 40 per cent or 50 per cent cut then, is a rate still in place in 2022.</p>\n\n<p>Of course, businesses have taken a hit. Hotels sat virtually empty, newspapers dropped advertisers, manufacturers sat idle on raw material hold ups, and sold less when they were producing. These are all losses.</p>\n\n<p>But when an organisation that is a group of people in various functions takes a hit, there is a unique kind of destruction that can follow from it being the powerful who decide how the losses are distributed. That is especially so when those powerful decide that it is those with the least power and the fewest resources that will carry the can for everyone.</p>\n\n<p>So, in those companies, the employees and casual workers are still paying back the losses that the whole organisation suffered from their own salaries, to maintain or improve returns to shareholders, or maintain the same price to customers.</p>\n\n<p>For sure, in Kenya\u2019s culture, built as it is, every tendency is towards pushing the losses down to those with the least voice and the fewest alternatives.</p>\n\n<p>But little wonder then, that people are leaving jobs as never before. And little wonder, too, that poverty is up, now including the family of the askari who has been earning 30 per cent less for coming up for two years.</p>\n\n<p>In truth, we should be examining firms that are holding on to pay cuts in 2022 for their real, underlying performance, both as shareholders and as employees.</p>\n\n<p>For, if last year brought over 5 per cent GDP growth, if the hotels are back up to near-previous occupancy levels, if the ports are open and the tourists are moving if the curfew is gone and the widespread absenteeism too, then why would salaries be down now, even by 5 per cent?</p>\n\n<p>Yes, the hits left a hole in profits and in cash flow, but after two years there are ways to look at pricing formulas, and if a business is without the innovation to see any new opportunities, honestly: get out.

the breakdown of a 220kV Kiambere \u2013 Embakasi electricity transmission line.", "articleBody": "Kenya was on Tuesday plunged into another nationwide blackout following the breakdown of a 220kV Kiambere \u2013 Embakasi electricity transmission line at 10.45 am.\n\nThe line evacuates power from the 168-megawatt Kiambere Hydropower Station which is part of the Seven Forks hydropower stations located along Tana River.\n\nThe latest blackout comes on the back of an increasing trend of breakdowns that continue to inconvenience millions of Kenyans and deny thousands of businesses the chance to participate in the economy.\n\nThe outage has seen hundreds of businesses across major towns in Kenya resort to generators to power their operations, increasing the cost of doing business.\n\nThe incident is happening barely a few weeks after the firm limited electricity supply to some consumers in parts of the country, including Nairobi after a key high-voltage power line collapsed.\n\nKenya Power #ticker:KPLC said then that parts of the 430 kilometer-long 400 kilovolts (kV) transmission line from Loiyangalani to the Suswa substation collapsed in December, cutting off the 310.25-megawatt Lake Turkana Wind Power (LTWP) plant in Marsabit, which supplies about 17 percent of Kenya\u2019s total peak power demand.\n\nThe transmission lines and Suswa substation are owned and operated by the Kenya Electricity Transmission Company (Ketraco).\n\nThe power rationing brings back memories of load shedding at the turn of the past decade that left homes in periodic darkness for hours due to low power supply from hydropower plants following an intense drought that saw demand outstrip supply.\n\nThe frequent blackouts should now concern the energy ministry which must move swiftly to establish the root causes of the transmission breakdowns.\n\nThe investigation should help rule out sabotage coming at a time when Kenya Power is preparing to hand over the operating systems to Ketraco and remove the burden from the utility company.\n\nIt should establish the weaknesses in the transmission systems, find out if some of the old aging lines need to be replaced but most importantly put in

He said billions were being siphoned annually through corruption, denying Kenyans services.\n\nAnd to walk the talk, President Kenyatta ensured heads started rolling, and in a few months, Cabinet secretaries, PSs, governors and senior government officials were arraigned over charges of corruption, in what came to be known informally as Kamata Kamata Fridays.\n\nSome of the big names taken to court included CSs Henry Rotich (Treasury), Hassan Wario (Sports), former Youth and Gender PS Lillian Omollo, Richard Lesiyampe (Agriculture), Sammy Itemere (Broadcasting) and Richard Ekai (Sports).\n\nGovernors included former Mike Sonko (Nairobi), his predecessor Evans Kidero, Sospeter Ojaamong (Busia), Moses Lenolkulal (Samburu) and Ferdinand Waititu (Kiambu).\n\nBut other than the case against Dr Wario and his co-accused, which has been concluded and the prosecution securing two convictions, all the others have been going on at a snail-pace partly due to disruptions caused by Covid-19.\n\nDr Wario was found guilty together with Chef De Mission to the Rio Olympics in 2016 Stephen Arap Soi. He was sentenced to six years with an option of paying a fine of Sh3.6 million, which he paid and got back his freedom. Mr Soi was sentenced to 17 years in jail after he failed to pay a fine of Sh105.6 million.\n\nAnother win for the prosecution was the jailing of Grace Wakhungu and Sirisia MP John Waluke. She was sentenced to jail for 69 years after chief magistrate Elizabeth Juma found her guilty of five counts in connection to theft at National Cereals and Produce Board (NCPB).\n\nMr Waluke was equally found guilty and sentenced to 67 years in prison, with both fined more than Sh2.1 billion as an alternative to the jail terms.\n\nThe two were later released on cash bail after spending about three months in jail and have appealed the conviction and sentences, saying it was excessive and that the prosecution shifted the burden of proof to them.\n\nBut many other cases are yet to be concluded. They include those facing former National Land Commission chairman Muhammad Swazuri, former Kenya Railways boss Atanas Maina and former managing directors Joe Sang (Kenya Pipeline Company), Ben Chumo and Ken Tarus (Kenya Power).\n\nDirector of Public Prosecutions Noordin Haji also promised to secure convictions by proving how the acts and omissions by those implicated were not only negligent but also well-calculated schemes to siphon public funds.\n\nBut when the first case of Covid-19 was reported in March last year, courts were among the hardest hit as the Judiciary was forced to scale down its services to stop the spread of coronavirus.\n\nChief Justice David Maraga later announced virtual hearings for urgent matters but criminal cases that had a large number of accused persons were suspended.\n\nWhen the open court resumed in June last year, judges and magistrates were forced to conduct sessions at the Judiciary car park as opposed to courtrooms. This is because the courtrooms are not big enough to accommodate a huge number of accused persons and litigants while observing social distancing measures.\n\nBefore resorting to open spaces, officials from the Health Ministry conducted a check at Milimani Law Courts and recommended open-air court sessions. They warned open court sessions could expose more people to Covid-19.\n\nAnd for cases that must be heard in open court, the ministry advised the Judiciary to take major precautionary measures, including reorganising sitting arrangements and limiting the number of people allowed into the premises, to ensure social distancing.\n\nChief Registrar of Judiciary Anne Amadi later directed courts to handle a maximum of five criminal cases a day and that witnesses would be given the specific dates and time to testify.\n\nWith the new directives, big corruption cases, which Kenyans expected to see concluded quickly, are hardly making traction.\n\nThis has seen some of the accused persons, among them Ms Omollo, file applications to strike out their cases for the long delay.\n\nThe law \u2014 Section 62(1) of the Anti-Corruption and Economic Crimes Act \u2014 states that a public or state officer who is charged with corruption or economic crime shall be suspended at half pay with effect from the date of the charge until the conclusion of the case. The law further says the case shall be determined within 24 months.\n\nMs Omollo argued in her application that the court has no authority to handle the case since the statutory timelines have since lapsed.\n\n\u201cThe jurisdiction of this court has been extinguished by effluxion of statutory timelines for determination of the case. This court has ceased to have jurisdiction to hear and determine the charges,\u201d she said through her lawyer.\n\nMs Omollo was charged on May 29, 2018, together with other senior officials at the National Youth Services staff such as former director-general Richard Ndubai, and suppliers with various counts including misuse of office, conspiracy to commit felony and money laundering.\n\nThe cases were divided among three months with the more than 30 civil servants, ranging from senior, middle and lower cadre, appearing in all the 10 files but the traders implicated in the matters, placed in different files.\n\nThe traders alleged to have received funds include Ameri Traders, belonging to James Katululu and George Mvuli (Sh28,766) and Ms Catherine Kamuyu and Sarah Murugu of Ersatz Enterprises (Sh26.6 million for goods not supplied).\n\nAnn Wambere Wanjiku of Annwaw Investments was accused of receiving Sh59.8 million, while Lucy Wambui Ngirita of Waluko Investment, Phylis Njeri Ngirita and Jeremiah Gichini Ngirita of Jerrycathy Enterprises were said to have received Sh72.2 million for goods not supplied.\n\nOthers are Anderine Grace Nyambura of Kalabash Food Supplies (Sh9 million from NYS), Firstling, whose directors are Kenneth Mwathi Mburu, James Thuita Nderitu and Yvonne Wanjiku, accused of receiving Sh115.5 for goods not supplied.\n\nPeter Wagurah Kimani and Anthony Makara Wamiti of Arkroad Holdings allegedly received Sh24.8 million while Catherine Wanjiku Mwai of Kunjiwa Enterprises is accused of receiving Sh23.4 million.\n\nAnother accused person, Benson Muturi, who is facing charges together with former Kenya Power CEOs, Dr Chumo and Mr Tarus, has also filed an application to quash his charges on grounds of the delay in the conclusion of the trial. They were charged on July 16, 2018.\n\nMr Muturi says it\u2019s been three years since they were charged and the indefinite pendency of the matter, suspension and his half-pay as a suspended public officer amounts to infringement of his constitutional rights to be presumed innocent until found guilty.\n\nIt is the same scenario for 26 people, among them former Devolution PS Peter Mangiti, former NYS director-general Nelson Githinji, businessman Ben Gethi and Josephine Kabura, who were charged earlier with the loss of Sh791 million at the State agency.\n\nThe wheels of justice have been slow despite a move by former CJ Maraga to increase the number of magistrates at Milimani, to hear the graft cases.\n\nBut in a recent address, Chief Justice Martha Koome acknowledged that more Judges and magistrates alone will not solve the slow wheels of justice.\n\n\u201cImproved procedures alone will not ease the backlog, to accomplish 100 percent case clearance rate, will require a combination of various factors such as effective use of technology, inter-agency coordination, adequate staffing and funding, habitable courtrooms and working stations, in addition to the single most important ingredient \u2014 the service of dedicated judges, judicial officers and supporting personnel in courts,\u201d she said.\n\nThe CJ said the Judiciary must continue to expand the use of trained court administrators, modern technology and modern business methods.\n\nThe office of the DPP has also been exploring the use of alternative dispute resolution mechanisms and plea bargains to help cases move along faster.\n\nFor instance, in the case facing former Treasury Cabinet secretary, Mr Rotich, over the Kimwarer and Arror dam scandals, the State withdrew charges against his co-accused \u2014 former PSs Kamau Thugge (Treasury) and Susan Koech (Tourism) \u2014 and turned them into State witnesses in the matter to improve he chances of securing a conviction.", "articleBodyHtml":

They were charged on July 16, 2018.</p>\n\n<p>Mr Muturi says it\u2019s been three years since they were charged and the indefinite pendency of the matter, suspension and his half-pay as a suspended public officer amounts to infringement of his constitutional rights to be presumed innocent until found guilty.</p>\n\n<p>It is the same scenario for 26 people, among them former Devolution PS Peter Mangiti, former NYS director-general Nelson Githinji, businessman Ben Gethi and Josephine Kabura, who were charged earlier with the loss of Sh791 million at the State agency.</p>\n\n<p>The wheels of justice have been slow despite a move by former CJ Maraga to increase the number of magistrates at Milimani, to hear the graft cases.</p>\n\n<p>But in a recent address, Chief Justice Martha Koome acknowledged that more Judges and magistrates alone will not solve the slow wheels of justice.</p>\n\n<p>\u201cImproved procedures alone will not ease the backlog, to accomplish 100 percent case clearance rate, will require a combination of various factors such as effective use of technology, inter-agency coordination, adequate staffing and funding, habitable courtrooms and working stations, in addition to the single most important ingredient \u2014 the service of dedicated judges, judicial officers and supporting personnel in courts,\u201d she said.</p>\n\n<p>The CJ said the Judiciary must continue to expand the use of trained court administrators, modern technology and modern business methods.</p>\n\n<p>The office of the DPP has also been exploring the use of alternative dispute resolution mechanisms and plea bargains to help cases move along faster.</p>\n\n<p>For instance, in the case facing former Treasury Cabinet secretary, Mr Rotich, over the Kimwarer and Arror dam scandals, the State withdrew charges against his co-accused \u2014 former PSs Kamau Thugge (Treasury) and Susan Koech (Tourism) \u2014 and turned them into State witnesses in the matter to improve he chances of securing a conviction.</p>\n\n</article>", "canonicalUrl": "https://www.businessdailyafrica.com/bd/data-hub"},{"url": "https://www.businessdailyafrica.com/bd/economy/ex-dubai-bank-chair-former-kq-bosses-over-sh0-5bn-theft-3679122", "probability": 0.95415336, "headline": "Ex-Dubai bank chair, former KQ bosses charged over Sh0.5bn theft", "datePublished": "2022-01-11T21:00:00+00:00", "datePublishedRaw": "2022-01-11T21:00:00Z", "dateModified": "2022-01-11T15:50:59+00:00", "dateModifiedRaw": "2022-01-11T15:50:59Z", "author": "SAM KIPLAGAT", "authorsList": ["SAM KIPLAGAT"], "inLanguage": "en", "breadcrumbs": [{"name": "Home", "link": "https://www.businessdailyafrica.com/bd"}, {"name": "Economy", "link": "https://www.businessdailyafrica.com/bd/economy"}], "mainImage": "https://www.businessdailyafrica.com/resource/blob/3679140/f9de3b4407fab49a8495615b116b876b/dubai-data.jpg", "description": "\nFormer Dubai Bank chairman Hassan Ahmed Zubeidi and former senior managers at Kenya Airways were on Tuesday charged with stealing Sh521.9 million from the national carrier.", "articleBody": "Economy\n\nFormer Dubai Bank chairman Hassan Ahmed Zubeidi and former senior managers at Kenya Airways #ticker:KQ were on Tuesday charged with stealing Sh521.9 million from the national carrier.\n\nMr Zubeidi was charged together with former managers at KQ, Elijah Itegi Githinji, Grace Wamuyu Mathenge, Jane Wanjiru Kiboi, Jackson Kiruti Njiiri and Elias Kyalo Ngao.\n\nThey allegedly committed the offence between 2013 and 2015 at Dubai Bank, which is currently under liquidation.\n\nThe Central Bank of Kenya placed Dubai Bank Kenya under a receiver in 2015 after the lender started experiencing liquidity and capital deficiencies which raised concerns that it was unlikely to meet its financial obligations.\n\nThey denied seven counts including conspiracy to steal, stealing, forgery and money laundering charges.\n\nMr Zubeidi was to be charged in 2018 but he moved to the High Court and stopped his prosecution.\n\nThe first count stated that all six accused persons conspired to steal Sh521.9 million from Kenya Airways.\n\nMr Zubeidi and Mr Githinji are further accused of stealing Sh13.5 million at Dubai Bank, Eastleigh branch, an offence they allegedly committed between February 11, 2015, and January 13, 2015.

jump posted in the same period in 2016 when the bill stood at Sh82.83 billion.\n\nRetailers link the jump to the growing popularity of online trading that has increased direct ordering and shipping of food and a deficiency in condiments \u2014 used to add flavour or colour to food like barbecue sauce, compound butter, teriyaki sauce.\n\n\u201cThere has been a rise in online trading that has now made it possible for people to source varieties that are not available locally and bring them. It is also cheaper to get most of the products abroad than locally,\u201d Wambui Mbarire, CEO of Retail Trade Association of Kenya (Retrak).\n\n\u201cThe deficiency of general food condiments that include sauces, meat sauce, mint sauce and prepared mustard has also driven the imports,\u201d\n\nLast year\u2019s food import bill was Sh22.82 billion more than the amount spent in the first nine months of 2017 when a biting drought hurt crop and fodder production.\n\nThe food crisis in 2017 prompted the Treasury to allow subsidies and waiver of import duties for a smooth purchase of key food items such as maize, rice and milk powder from abroad.\n\nThe data shows that food imports for industrial use rose to Sh31.66 billion last September from Sh21.87 billion in January.\n\nOverall the import bill for primary foods and beverages by households and industries grew to Sh35.55 billion in September from Sh26.13 billion at the start of last year.\n\nThe record food import bill also came as a ravaging drought put about 2.1 million Kenyans at risk of starvation at the back of poor and delayed rains, especially in the coastal and northeastern counties.\n\nKenya recorded poor rains in March and May last year prompting the United Nations to warn of a looming crisis.\n\nThe UN had said that Kenya needed an estimated Sh9.4 billion to mitigate the drought between July and November last year.", "articleBodyHtml": "<article>\n\n<figure><img src=\"data:image/png;base64,iVBORw0KGgoAAAANSUhEUgAAAAEAAAABCAQAAAC1HAwCAAAAC0lEQVR42mNkYAAAAAYAAjCB0C8AAAAASUVORK5CYII=\" alt=\"maize\" title=\"\" data-cm-responsive-media='[{\"name\":\"landscape_ratio16x9\",\"ratioWidth\":16,\"ratioHeight\":9,\"linksForWidth\":{\"200\":\"/resource/image/3677910/landscape_ratio16x9/200/112/3cbcc00d481764c6d5839c9d0a3f13bd/kA/maize.jpg\",\"300\":\"/resource/image/3677910/landscape_ratio16x9/300/168/3cbcc00d481764c6d5839c9d0a3f13bd/FY/maize.jpg\",\"400\":\"/resource/image/3677910/landscape_ratio16x9/400/225/3cbcc00d481764c6d5839c9d0a3f13bd/gX/maize.jpg\",\"1160\":\"/resource/image/3677910/landscape_ratio16x9/1160/652/3cbcc00d481764c6d5839c9d0a3f13bd/Af/maize.jpg\"}},{\"name\":\"portrait_ratio2x3\",\"ratioWidth\":2,\"ratioHeight\":3,\"linksForWidth\":{\"200\":\"/resource/image/3677910/portrait_ratio2x3/200/300/20d8f7cfb28f769692b32e736c1e0624/Yi/maize.jpg\",\"400\":\"/resource/image/3677910/portrait_ratio2x3/400/600/20d8f7cfb28f769692b32e736c1e0624/wn/maize.jpg\",\"768\":\"/resource/image/3677910/portrait_ratio2x3/768/1152/20d8f7cfb28f769692b32e736c1e0624/pH/maize.jpg\"}},{\"name\":\"landscape_ratio2x1\",\"ratioWidth\":2,\"ratioHeight\":1,\"linksForWidth\":{\"200\":\"/resource/image/3677910/landscape_ratio2x1/200/100/1593e616a571cf3fb5dc33a42c37c670/Wa/maize.jpg\"}},{\"name\":\"landscape_ratio3x2\",\"ratioWidth\":3,\"ratioHeight\":2,\"linksForWidth\":{\"300\":\"/resource/image/3677910/landscape_ratio3x2/300/200/58b71fb31ba52280b8d0354d76570679/Yu/maize.jpg\",\"400\":\"/resource/image/3677910/landscape_ratio3x2/400/267/58b71fb31ba52280b8d0354d76570679/YM/maize.jpg\",\"768\":\"/resource/image/3677910/landscape_ratio3x2/768/512/58b71fb31ba52280b8d0354d76570679/gm/maize.jpg\"}},{\"name\":\"portrait_ratio1x1\",\"ratioWidth\":1,\"ratioHeight\":1,\"linksForWidth\":{\"50\":\"/resource/image/3677910/portrait_ratio1x1/50/50/842bc090d5610887b53cd70b7af2d85e/tG/maize.jpg\",\"60\":\"/resource/image/3677910/portrait_ratio1x1/60/60/842bc090d5610887b53cd70b7af2d85e/Ar/maize.jpg\",\"200\":\"/resource/image/3677910/portrait_ratio1x1/200/200/842bc090d5610887b53cd70b7af2d85e/jr/maize.jpg\",\"400\":\"/resource/image/3677910/portrait_ratio1x1/400/400/842bc090d5610887b53cd70b7af2d85e/XN/maize.jpg\",\"768\":\"/resource/image/3677910/portrait_ratio1x1/768/768/842bc090d5610887b53cd70b7af2d85e/oq/maize.jpg\"}},{\"name\":\"landscape_ratio4x3\",\"ratioWidth\":4,\"ratioHeight\":3,\"linksForWidth\":{\"200\":\"/resource/image/3677910/landscape_ratio4x3/200/150/3ff8332414e66f1305b269f2b5e453f2/Vu/maize.jpg\",\"400\":\"/resource/image/3677910/landscape_ratio4x3/400/300/3ff8332414e66f1305b269f2b5e453f2/eZ/maize.jpg\",\"768\":\"/resource/image/3677910/landscape_ratio4x3/768/576/3ff8332414e66f1305b269f2b5e453f2/EB/maize.jpg\"}}]'>\n\n<figcaption><p>Maize produce in a store in Uasin Gishu on March 11, 2020.
