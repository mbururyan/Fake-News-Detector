The family did not have the \u00a36,000 (KSh 902,000) needed by the company that does body repatriation.\n\nHis friend had not taken insurance to cover expenses like these. They had to create a GoFundMe account to raise the money needed. It was a nightmare for him and the family. The wife ended up borrowing money from the bank to meet the costs.\n\nDiaspora Insurance\n\nYears later, during a church service at one of the local churches, Kapami came across Diaspora Insurance company\u2019s stand, and he took an interest in what they had to offer.\n\n\u201cI wasn\u2019t serious. I just wanted to find out what they could do. So I talked to a gentleman there and asked him what he was doing there, which countries they service,\" Kapami said in an interview.\n\nThe gentleman advised Kapami that Diaspora Insurance provided a funeral policy that paid cash upon the death of a loved one. They targeted Africans in the diasporas and paid up to \u00a320 (KSh 3,000).\n\nOne of the things that Kapami was impressed by were the low premiums that the company offered.\n\n\u201cThe premiums were quite low, something like 20 pounds per individual,\u201d he recalled.\n\nKapami shared with his wife, Bessie Kapami, about the insurance cover. After reviewing it together, they agreed it was more affordable than the 200 pounds (KSh 30,000) they\u2019d been paying for insurance with a different firm.\n\n\u201cI thought it was reasonable at that particular time, and it\u2019s more affordable looking at the actual costs involved,\u201d Kapami noted. Not only was it cheap, but it offered many appealing features like the fact that you could add people back in Zambia on the same policy, something which the UK insurers could not do. Moreover, Kapami and his family would remain covered even if they relocated to Zambia later on.\n\nRight from the beginning, Kapami and his wife had started preparing to go back to Zambia.\n\n\u201cWe thought we should start preparing for our retirement so we came here and started doing all our projects with the intention that one day or the other, we\u2019ll be old so we should come back to Zambia,\u201d he added.\n\nLittle did Kapami know that he would soon need the same insurance cover.\n\nIn March 2021, Kapami lost his beloved late wife, Bessie, who took the Diaspora Insurance cover.\n\n\u201cWe were both covered even when we traveled for the burial of our friend during the COVID-19 era from about March 2020 till now,\u201d he recalled.\n\nWhen the time came for Kapami to organise his wife\u2019s funeral, he wasn\u2019t sure where all the funds would come from, but he knew he had to get things going.\n\nHe needed to bring his late wife\u2019s body to Zambia to honour her wishes to return home to Zambia.\n\nRepatriation costs\n\nSo, he and three other people began the process of repatriating Bessie\u2019s body back to Zambia. They had to foot several costs, including travel and hotel accommodation.\n\n\u201cLooking at that cost alone, it\u2019s very high. Plus, the airline we always use had canceled all flights to the UK, so we weren\u2019t sure how we were going to travel back with the high costs,\u201d he quipped.\n\nThe costs of repatriation plus travelling with the three family members proved a huge cost for Kapami.\n\nHe was desperate for a miracle.\n\nTwo days after his wife died, Kapami got in touch with Diaspora Insurance and shared with them what had happened and what he was going through.\n\nThe insurance company swung into action and deposited money into Kapami\u2019s account to cater to funeral expenses.\n\n\u201cI got in touch I think after two days, and the fourth day, they had transferred the money to my account. They looked at my premium payments and saw that everything was up to date, and that was all they needed from me,\u201d Kapami said delightfully.\n\nDiaspora Insurance had helped relieve Kapami\u2019s heavy load at the time when he needed them the most.\n\n\u201cThey did everything and then called me to check my account and confirm if the money had been deposited was there,\u201d he added.\n\nThe insurance company had come through for Kapami. They paid for repatriation and everything else he had needed for to give his late wife a befitting sendoff.\n\nThe cost of death in the diaspora\n\nWhen a loved one dies in another country, it\u2019s not only expensive but also requires immediate and significant financial resources to cover a host of costs.\n\nAmong those costs include:\n\nProlonged funeral vigils abroad and back home.\nBody repatriation.\nFamily travel to or from the diaspora.\nBurial costs (coffin/casket, food, church service, photography/videography, flowers and d\u00e9cor, memorial services, household bills, shipment of the deceased\u2019s personal effects).\nLocal transfers or transportation.\nCost of burial, whether abroad or back home.\nHousehold bills like electricity.\nMemorial service and/or Tombstone ceremony\n\nAll these and other related costs have untold suffering on the deceased\u2019s next of kin and relatives. There\u2019s the trauma of mourning their loved one with empty pockets to emotional scars, no closure, loss of personal/family dignity, undignified send-off, post-funeral bills, no peace of mind or protection of loved ones, and more.\n\nOf all these costs, body repatriation takes a huge chunk. That\u2019s because there are several costs attached to it, including administration, flights, body preparation, and even getting a casket to ship the body from the foreign country and back home.\n\nSuch costs could easily top a whopping USD 15,000 or \u00a35,000 if you\u2019re repatriating from the US or UK, respectively, which translates to about KSh 765,000 to 1.5 million, or more.\n\nFor most African families, it\u2019s hard to raise such staggering amounts, so they end up borrowing from a bank or enduring the embarrassment and double trauma of begging from strangers on GoFundMe and other platforms. The repatriation process is also complex, and it differs depending on each country. Read more on the Diaspora Insurance website.\n\nDiaspora Insurance provides Africans living in the diaspora with their flagship product \u2013 The Diaspora Funeral Cash Plan (DFCP), a product born out of personal tragedies and experiences.\n\nWith the DFCP plan, bereaved families are assured of giving their deceased kin a befitting send-off bereft of the embarrassment of begging from strangers to foot the bill.\n\nSpecifically, the DFCP offers benefits such as:\n\nImmediate cash pay-out.\nWorldwide protection without borders: Once you are on the policy, you remain covered wherever you are, even if you relocate back home.\nCover for you and your loved ones wherever they are: most insurers don\u2019t cover out of territory risk.\nUniquely flexible: you get burial abroad, body repatriation or cremation, and much more. Your family can choose what they want to do, for instance, repatriate their loved one to the country of birth or to lay them to rest in the host country.\nTo learn more about the key features and benefits of the DFCP, please go to Diaspora Funeral Cash Plan.\n\nThe versatility of a cash-based funeral cash plan was amply demonstrated when the late Pamela Tawengwa sadly passed away whilst on visit in her native country, Zimbabwe, and the family opted to honour her wishes to be buried in the UK, her newly adopted country.\n\nHer Diaspora Funeral Cash Plan was used to honour her wishes by paying for reverse repatriation. She was repatriated and laid to rest in Leicester, UK and a very dignified send-off. A suitable cover should always speak to and address the policyholder's needs, even transnational citizens.\n\nWant to know more about the Diaspora Funeral Cash Plan?\n\nWatch Diaspora Insurance\u2019s CEO, Jeff Madzingo, explain how the cover works to help Diasporans across the world. The Diaspora Funeral Cash Plan is available to at least 13 African nationalities in the diaspora, including Kenyans. Each life on the policy can be covered for up to $/\u00a3/\u20ac20 000.\n\nDiaspora Insurance doesn\u2019t stop at doing business with its clients. They also have a direct impact on the communities they serve and change realities through their core business.\n\nFew people consider funeral costs until they need to.\n\nWith Diaspora Insurance, you can protect your loved ones from the distress of arranging an \u201cat need funeral\u201d and unexpected costs.\n\nFor Kapami, Diaspora Insurance provided a lumpsum within 24 hours of providing proof of the death of his late beloved wife, Bessie.\n\n\u201cWe had enough money to repatriate her, which was the most important thing for us, and with the money from Diaspora Insurance, we knew that it was going to be easier compared to when we didn\u2019t have that cash,\u201d said Kapami.\n\n\u201cAs people in diaspora, we send money out to help our relatives back home but sometimes we forget we will one day need that money to solve our own problems. We need such kind of a (insurance) plan that will assist us,\u201d he added.\n\nKapami urged everyone to take up a cover with Diaspora Insurance because they expedite processes quickly and release the cash when you need it, unlike other companies that take a long time to process payments. Plus, it goes a long way when contributions from family members aren\u2019t enough to cover what you need.\n\nUltimately, Diaspora Insurance gives you guaranteed peace of mind, and it protects your dignity by giving your loved ones a dignified send-off when they depart.\n\nDiaspora Insurance for more information.", "articleBodyHtml": "<article>\n\n<p><strong>When Martin Kapami left his home in Lusaka, Zambia, for the United Kingdom, he set his sights on the opportunities ahead. </strong></p>\n\n<p>All was going well until he lost a <a href=\"https://www.tuko.co.ke/family/\">family</a> friend in the UK, whose body needed to be repatriated back to Zambia for burial.

Moreover, Kapami and his family would remain covered even if they relocated to Zambia later on.</blockquote>\n\n<p>Right from the beginning, Kapami and his wife had started preparing to go back to Zambia.</p>\n\n<blockquote>\u201cWe thought we should start preparing for our retirement so we came here and started doing all our projects with the intention that one day or the other, we\u2019ll be old so we should come back to Zambia,\u201d he added.</blockquote>\n\n<p>Little did Kapami know that he would soon need the same insurance cover.</p>\n\n<p>In March 2021, Kapami lost his beloved late wife, Bessie, who took the Diaspora Insurance cover.</p>\n\n<blockquote>\u201cWe were both covered even when we traveled for the burial of our friend during the COVID-19 era from about March 2020 till now,\u201d he recalled.</blockquote>\n\n<figure><img src=\"https://netstorage-tuko.akamaized.net/images/96293d5f3fdf9481.jpg?imwidth=900\" srcset=\"/tuko/img/placeholder.gif\" alt=\"Diaspora Story: The Conundrum of Living in Two Societies\" title=\"Diaspora Story: The Conundrum of Living in Two Societies\" data-srcset=\"https://netstorage-tuko.akamaized.net/images/96293d5f3fdf9481.jpg?imwidth=250 250w, https://netstorage-tuko.akamaized.net/images/96293d5f3fdf9481.jpg?imwidth=360 360w, https://netstorage-tuko.akamaized.net/images/96293d5f3fdf9481.jpg?imwidth=430 430w, https://netstorage-tuko.akamaized.net/images/96293d5f3fdf9481.jpg?imwidth=720 720w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1021px) calc(100vw - 2 * 13px), (max-width: 1400px) calc((100vw - 2 * 20px - 2 * 20px) / 2), 800px\"></figure>\n\n<p>When the time came for Kapami to organise his wife\u2019s funeral, he wasn\u2019t sure where all the funds would come from, but he knew he had to get things going.</p>\n\n<p>He needed to bring his late wife\u2019s body to Zambia to honour her wishes to return home to Zambia.</p>\n\n<h2>Repatriation costs</h2>\n\n<p>So, he and three other people began the process of repatriating Bessie\u2019s body back to Zambia. They had to foot several costs, including travel and hotel accommodation.</p>\n\n<blockquote>\u201cLooking at that cost alone, it\u2019s very high. Plus, the airline we always use had canceled all flights to the UK, so we weren\u2019t sure how we were going to travel back with the high costs,\u201d he quipped.</blockquote>\n\n<p>The costs of repatriation plus travelling with the three family members proved a huge cost for Kapami.</p>\n\n<p>He was desperate for a miracle.</p>\n\n<p>Two days after his wife died, Kapami got in touch with Diaspora Insurance and shared with them what had happened and what he was going through.</p>\n\n<p>The insurance company swung into action and deposited money into Kapami\u2019s account to cater to funeral expenses.</p>\n\n<blockquote>\u201cI got in touch I think after two days, and the fourth day, they had transferred the money to my account. They looked at my premium payments and saw that everything was up to date, and that was all they needed from me,\u201d Kapami said delightfully.</blockquote>\n\n<p>Diaspora Insurance had helped relieve Kapami\u2019s heavy load at the time when he needed them the most.</p>\n\n<blockquote>\u201cThey did everything and then called me to check my account and confirm if the money had been deposited was there,\u201d he added.</blockquote>\n\n<p>The insurance company had come through for Kapami. They paid for repatriation and everything else he had needed for to give his late wife a befitting sendoff.</p>\n\n<h2>The cost of death in the diaspora</h2>\n\n<p>When a loved one dies in another country, it\u2019s not only expensive but also requires immediate and significant financial resources to cover a host of costs.</p>\n\n<p>Among those costs include:</p>\n\n<ul><li>Prolonged funeral vigils abroad and back home.</li><li>Body repatriation.</li><li>Family travel to or from the diaspora.</li><li>Burial costs (coffin/casket, food, church service, photography/videography, flowers and d\u00e9cor, memorial services, household bills, shipment of the deceased\u2019s personal effects).</li><li>Local transfers or transportation.</li><li>Cost of burial, whether abroad or back home.</li><li>Household bills like electricity.</li><li>Memorial service and/or Tombstone ceremony </li></ul>\n\n<p>All these and other related costs have untold suffering on the deceased\u2019s next of kin and relatives. There\u2019s the trauma of mourning their loved one with empty pockets to emotional scars, no closure, loss of personal/family dignity, undignified send-off, post-funeral bills, no peace of mind or protection of loved ones, and more.</p>\n\n<p>Of all these costs, body repatriation takes a huge chunk. That\u2019s because there are several costs attached to it, including administration, flights, body preparation, and even getting a casket to ship the body from the foreign country and back home.</p>\n\n<figure><img src=\"https://netstorage-tuko.akamaized.net/images/16d7dda31a4c7606.jpg?imwidth=900\" srcset=\"/tuko/img/placeholder.gif\" alt=\"Diaspora Story: The Conundrum of Living in Two Societies\" title=\"Diaspora Story: The Conundrum of Living in Two Societies\" data-srcset=\"https://netstorage-tuko.akamaized.net/images/16d7dda31a4c7606.jpg?imwidth=250 250w, https://netstorage-tuko.akamaized.net/images/16d7dda31a4c7606.jpg?imwidth=360 360w, https://netstorage-tuko.akamaized.net/images/16d7dda31a4c7606.jpg?imwidth=430 430w, https://netstorage-tuko.akamaized.net/images/16d7dda31a4c7606.jpg?imwidth=720 720w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1021px) calc(100vw - 2 * 13px), (max-width: 1400px) calc((100vw - 2 * 20px - 2 * 20px) / 2), 800px\"></figure>\n\n<p>Such costs could easily top a whopping USD 15,000 or \u00a35,000 if you\u2019re repatriating from the US or UK, respectively, which translates to about KSh 765,000 to 1.5 million, or more.</p>\n\n<p>For most African families, it\u2019s hard to raise such staggering amounts, so they end up borrowing from a bank or enduring the embarrassment and double trauma of begging from strangers on GoFundMe and other platforms. The repatriation process is also complex, and it differs depending on each country.

Your family can choose what they want to do, for instance, repatriate their loved one to the country of birth or to lay them to rest in the host country. </li><li>To learn more about the key features and benefits of the DFCP, please go to <a href=\"https://diasporainsurance.com/diaspora-funeral-cash-plan/why-funeral-cash-plan-is-by-far-the-best/\">Diaspora Funeral Cash Plan.</a></li></ul>\n\n<p>The versatility of a cash-based funeral cash plan was amply demonstrated when <a href=\"https://youtu.be/hRdZfdd1pQM\">the late Pamela Tawengwa</a> sadly passed away whilst on visit in her native country, Zimbabwe, and the family opted to honour her wishes to be buried in the UK, her newly adopted country.</p>\n\n<p>Her Diaspora Funeral Cash Plan was used to honour her wishes by paying for reverse repatriation. She was repatriated and laid to rest in Leicester, UK and a very dignified send-off. A suitable cover should always speak to and address the policyholder's needs, even transnational citizens.</p>\n\n<h2>Want to know more about the Diaspora Funeral Cash Plan?</h2>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jqaSTAAgFp8\" title=\"\">Watch Diaspora Insurance\u2019s CEO, Jeff Madzingo</a>, explain how the cover works to help Diasporans across the <a href=\"https://www.tuko.co.ke/tag/world-news/\">world</a>. The Diaspora Funeral Cash Plan is available to at least 13 African nationalities in the diaspora, including Kenyans. Each life on the policy can be covered for up to $/\u00a3/\u20ac20 000.</p>\n\n<p>Diaspora Insurance doesn\u2019t stop at doing <a href=\"https://www.tuko.co.ke/tag/kenyan-business/\">business</a> with its clients. They also have a <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fy_C-8ykLio\">direct impact on the communities they serve</a> and <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2VHCkwzqCwg\">change realities</a> through their core business.</p>\n\n<p>Few people consider funeral costs until they need to.</p>\n\n<p>With Diaspora Insurance, you can protect your loved ones from the distress of arranging an \u201cat need funeral\u201d and unexpected costs.</p>\n\n<p>For Kapami, Diaspora Insurance provided a lumpsum within 24 hours of providing proof of the death of his late beloved wife, Bessie.</p>\n\n<blockquote>\u201cWe had enough money to repatriate her, which was the most important thing for us, and with the money from Diaspora Insurance, we knew that it was going to be easier compared to when we didn\u2019t have that cash,\u201d said Kapami.</blockquote>\n\n<blockquote>\u201cAs people in diaspora, we send money out to help our relatives back home but sometimes we forget we will one day need that money to solve our own problems. We need such kind of a (insurance) plan that will assist us,\u201d he added.</blockquote>\n\n<p>Kapami urged everyone to take up a cover with Diaspora Insurance because they expedite processes quickly and release the cash when you need it, unlike other companies that take a long time to process payments. Plus, it goes a long way when contributions from family members aren\u2019t enough to cover what you need.</p>\n\n<p>Ultimately, Diaspora Insurance gives you guaranteed peace of mind, and it protects your dignity by giving your loved ones a dignified send-off when they depart.</p>\n\n<p><a href=\"http://www.diasporainsurance.com/\"> Diaspora Insurance</a> for more information.</p>\n\n</article>", "canonicalUrl": "https://www.tuko.co.ke/facts-lifehacks/433758-diaspora-story-the-conundrum-living-two-societies/"},{"url": "https://www.tuko.co.ke/kenya/436867-kenyan-woman-gifts-her-househelp-loads-cash-phones-handbags-thank-you/", "probability": 0.966305, "headline": "Kenyan Woman Gifts Her Househelp Loads of Cash, Phones and Handbag: \"Thank You\"", "datePublished": "2021-12-15T08:38:07+03:00", "datePublishedRaw": "2021-12-15T08:38:07+03:00", "dateModified": "2021-12-15T08:38:07+03:00", "dateModifiedRaw": "2021-12-15T08:38:07+03:00", "author": "Racheal Nyaguthie", "authorsList": ["Racheal Nyaguthie"], "inLanguage": "en", "breadcrumbs": [{"name": "Home", "link": "https://www.tuko.co.ke"}, {"name": "Kenya", "link": "https://www.tuko.co.ke/kenya/"}], "mainImage": "https://netstorage-tuko.akamaized.net/images/bf174d035309c9ed.jpg", "images": ["https://netstorage-tuko.akamaized.net/images/bf174d035309c9ed.jpg?imwidth=900"], "description": "The Kenyan woman identified as Effie Keens Kaano from Kisumu county thought it wise to reward her domestic help of two years as she goes home for Christmas.", "articleBody": "A kind Kenyan woman left her housegirl with a smile on her face after gifting her money, phones and a bag\nThe Kisumu woman said she appreciated her nanny identified as Nancy with the presents because she did not want her to go home for Christmas empty-handed\nThe employer had displayed the gifts on a chart that was decorated with a beautiful thank you message for the nanny\n\nA Kisumu woman has warmed many hearts after gifting her house girl several goodies as appreciation for work well done in 2021.\n\nThe woman identified as Effie Keens Kaano thought it wise to reward her domestic help of two years as she breaks for the holidays.\n\nSpeaking to TUKO.co.ke the mother of one said she gifted her house girl cash, a smartphone and another feature phone for her mum along with a handbag so that she would not go home for Christmas empty-handed.\n\n\"She is just an employee like any other person.
