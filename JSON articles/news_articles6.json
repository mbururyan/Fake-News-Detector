Scroll to continue reading.</p>\n\n<p>The theme for this year\u2019s International Anti-Corruption Day underlines the rights and responsibilities of each person to speak out against corruption. This is especially critical as Kenya heads into an election year in 2022, whereby transparency and accountability will be required to uphold democracy.</p>\n\n<p>How can we ensure a world of work devoid of corruption?</p>\n\n<p>First, creating a culture of integrity and openness \u2013 where ethical challenges resulting from conducting business in a corrupt environment are freely addressed and workers feel empowered to do the right thing \u2013 is an effective tool to help minimize the likelihood of an ethical breach.</p>\n\n<p>Secondly, embracing a collective action approach where private sector joins hands with government and civil society helps individual businesses become more effective in their approaches and reduces opportunities for retaliation.</p>\n\n<p>Global Compact Network Kenya continues to promote the Code of Ethics for Business in Kenya \u2013 a collective action initiative in partnership with Kenya Private Sector Alliance (KEPSA) and Kenya Association of Manufacturers (KAM). By signing onto the code, businesses are committing to treating their stakeholders with respect, to running their operations with responsibility, to acting in compliance with all applicable laws and regulations and to be actively involved in corruption prevention. Together, these businesses form an ethical community of champions who are playing their part in creating a clean and safe environment where every business has an equal chance at succeeding.</p>\n\n<p>As we prepare to ring in the new year, we must understand and embrace our individual and collective roles and responsibilities to say no to corruption.</p>\n\n<p>Now more than ever, business leaders need to act with ethical leadership and integrity. Above all, we call on the private sector to remain vigilant and support a unified front that ensures we recover stronger and recover better.</p>\n\n</article>", "canonicalUrl": "https://www.capitalfm.co.ke/news/2021/12/judy-njino-your-right-your-role-say-no-to-corruption/"},{"url": "https://www.capitalfm.co.ke/news/2021/12/berlin-court-to-rule-in-high-stakes-russian-hitman-case/", "probability": 0.96676964, "headline": "Berlin court to rule in high-stakes \u2018Russian hitman\u2019 case", "datePublished": "2021-12-15T08:04:04.018210", "datePublishedRaw": "2021-12-15 (2 hours ago)", "dateModified": "2021-12-15T00:00:00", "dateModifiedRaw": "2021-12-15", "author": "AGENCE FRANCE PRESSE", "authorsList": ["AGENCE FRANCE PRESSE"], "inLanguage": "en", "mainImage": "https://www.capitalfm.co.ke/news/files/2021/12/bebf46db9d513e815b6038ca887823a55a352dfc.jpg", "images": ["https://www.capitalfm.co.ke/news/files/2021/12/bebf46db9d513e815b6038ca887823a55a352dfc.jpg"], "description": "Berlin, German, Dec 15 - A German court will decide Wednesday whether a Russian man is guilty of shooting dead a former Chechen commander in broad - Kenya breaking news | Kenya news today | Capitalfm.co.ke", "articleBody": "Berlin, German, Dec 15 \u2013 A German court will decide Wednesday whether a Russian man is guilty of shooting dead a former Chechen commander in broad daylight in a Berlin park on the orders of Moscow.\n\nThe suspect named by prosecutors as Vadim Krasikov, alias Vadim Sokolov, stands accused of gunning down 40-year-old Georgian national Tornike Kavtarashvili in the Kleiner Tiergarten park on August 23, 2019.\n\nOn charging Krasikov last year, prosecutors said they believed Russia had ordered the murder, making the case a flashpoint for already frayed ties between Berlin and Moscow.\n\nThe suspect is accused of approaching Kavtarashvili from behind on a bicycle and firing two shots from a Glock 26 pistol equipped with a silencer.\n\nAfter the victim fell to the ground, Krasikov is then accused of shooting him in the head, killing him on the spot, before getting back on his bicycle and fleeing.\n\nPolice divers later recovered the Glock handgun, a wig and a bicycle from the nearby Spree river.\n\n\u2013 Mistaken identity? \u2013\n\nCalling for Krasikov to be jailed for life as they summed up their case last week, prosecutors said they had identified him as a \u201ccommander of a special unit of Russian secret services FSB\u201d.\n\nAdvertisement.

power, North Korea\u2019s once youthful Kim Jong Un is now one of the world\u2019s more experienced leaders, and will look to defy the West for decades to come with his nuclear arsenal, analysts say.\n\nUnlike most of his counterparts, with no concerns over elections or term limits and age on his side \u2014 he is only in his late 30s \u2014 Kim can expect to remain in office for decades, as long as his health holds up.\n\nIt is a far different perspective to a democratic politician worrying about headlines every day, and Kim already has more experience in power than most heads of state he will deal with in the future.\n\nThe arc of his first 10 years points to the trajectory to come, analysts say, from isolation to nuclear development to sharing the diplomatic stage with the world\u2019s most powerful leaders.\n\n\u201cNorth Korea will maintain its confrontational status with the United States and harass it by tactically challenging it while making sure it doesn\u2019t cross the line to completely derail its relations,\u201d Kim Jin-ha, researcher at the Korea Institute for National Unification, told AFP.\n\nFor more than six years after inheriting power when his father and predecessor Kim Jong Il died on December 17, 2011, Kim did not leave his isolated country or meet any foreign heads of state.\n\nInitially seen by some as a figurehead for North Korea\u2019s generals and Workers\u2019 Party bureaucrats, he brutally established his authority, executing his uncle by marriage Jang Song Thaek for treason.\n\nHe was also accused of the assassination at Kuala Lumpur airport of his elder half-brother Kim Jong Nam with a nerve agent.\n\nAt the same time, Kim oversaw rapid progress in North Korea\u2019s banned weapons programmes.\n\nHe conducted four of its six nuclear tests and the 2017 launches of ballistic missiles that can reach the whole of the US mainland, defying increasingly severe UN Security Council sanctions along the way.\n\nFor months, he traded fiery rhetoric with then US president Donald Trump, raising fears of an armed conflict on the Korean Peninsula.\n\nThen he declared the country\u2019s nuclear arsenal \u201ccomplete\u201d and came knocking on the door of the outside world.\n\n\u2013 \u2018Fortuitous alignment\u2019 \u2013\n\nWith the assistance of dovish South Korean President Moon Jae-in, in 2018 Kim became the first North Korean leader ever to meet a sitting US president at a headline-grabbing Singapore summit.\n\nSoo Kim, an analyst at the RAND Corporation, said Pyongyang\u2019s nuclear arsenal was largely what made the encounter possible.\n\n\u201cNorth Korea\u2019s development of its weapons programme, the credibility of the nuclear and missile threat, and the fortuitous alignment of leadership \u2014 Trump, Moon, and Kim \u2014 helped prime the conditions,\u201d she said.\n\nWith just one meeting, the chubby young leader charmed the American businessman and reality TV host \u2014 some 40 years his senior.\n\nTrump boasted of forming a \u201cspecial bond\u201d, even \u201clove\u201d, with someone he had once mocked as \u201clittle rocket man\u201d.\n\nThe same year, Kim chatted in the woods with the Moon and had several meetings with Xi Jinping of China \u2014 North Korea\u2019s primary backer.\n\n\u201cThe effect was tantalising,\u201d said Sung-yoon Lee, professor of Korean Studies at Tufts University.\n\n\u201cThe cruel, funny-looking dictator had transformed himself into a reform-minded, peace-prone, responsible steward of nukes and gulags perhaps amenable to denuclearisation.\u201d\n\nThe amicable mood was short-lived: a second Trump-Kim summit in Hanoi collapsed over sanctions relief and what Pyongyang would be willing to give up in return.\n\nTrump quickly flew out of the Vietnamese capital and Kim took a 60-hour train ride back home empty-handed.\n\nA follow-up meeting in the Demilitarized Zone that divides the Korean peninsula did nothing to break the deadlock.\n\n\u2013 \u2018Common adversary\u2019 \u2013\n\nNorth Korea\u2019s dynastic regime and the ruling Workers\u2019 Party base their claim to a right to rule on nationalism, from asserting responsibility for the end of Japanese colonialism after World War II, to \u201cwinning\u201d the 1950-53 Korean War, to defying the United States ever since.\n\nOfficials and analysts say Kim never intended to fully give up his nuclear arsenal, which North Korea has pursued for decades at vast cost in resources and isolation, and is still developing further.\n\n\u201cHe can\u2019t feed the people, but he\u2019s able to maintain his regime\u2019s political survivability\u201d with his weapons, said Soo Kim of RAND Corporation. \u201cAnd this is more important to Kim.\u201d\n\nAnd with the United States set for long-term tensions with China, Kim will have an opportunity to follow the example of his grandfather Kim Il Sung.\n\nAdvertisement. Scroll to continue reading.\n\nNorth Korea\u2019s founder adeptly exploited Cold War tensions between Moscow and Beijing to play one Communist state off against another.\n\nThe ties between Pyongyang and Beijing \u2014 forged in the Korean War when their forces fought South Korea and a US-led UN coalition to a standstill \u2014 were \u201ca love-hate relationship between two \u2018frenemies\u2019\u201d, said Professor Lee of Tufts University.\n\n\u201cNeither adores the other, but recognises that the other is its closest ally in terms of strategy, ideology, history, and in taming the US, the common adversary.\u201d\n\n\u2013 \u2018Considerable success\u2019 \u2013\n\nKim has only to look across the border to China to see how increasing prosperity over many years can bolster the popularity of a one-party state.\n\nBut \u2014 to Beijing\u2019s frustration \u2014 while North Korea has acquired bombs and missiles, its state-led economy has been mismanaged for decades, even before sanctions, and its people suffer chronic food shortages.\n\nWith a vulnerable health system, last year it closed its borders after the coronavirus emerged in neighbouring China.\n\nThe self-imposed blockade remains in place, and while Pyongyang insists it has yet to see any cases of the disease \u2014 analysts doubt the claim \u2014 Kim has admitted resulting hardships and warned his people to prepare for the \u201cworst-ever situation\u201d.\n\n\u201cEconomically, North Korea is at the very bottom in the international order,\u201d said Park Won-gon, professor of North Korean studies at Ewha Womans University in Seoul.\n\n\u201cI\u2019d call that a considerable success on Pyongyang\u2019s part.\u201d", "articleBodyHtml": "<article>\n\n<p><strong><em>Seoul,

Responding to such events in a responsible, proactive and progressive manner is the only correct way to respond. Some businesses, however, continue to work oblivious of the need to mainstream human rights as part of their corporate operating pillars and strategies, and herein lies a huge risk.\n\nThe uptake of human rights standards has been more prominent in countries from the Global North. On the other hand, the uptake by countries from the Global South has been relatively slow. Perspectives and experiences from the North have also not helped much as the differences in the business landscape is far and wide. This slow uptake has resulted to misrepresentation of an inaccurate view that justice cannot be served within judicial and Non-judicial systems of countries such as Kenya.\n\nSince the adoption of the UN Guiding Principles on Business and Human Rights (UNGPs) in 2011, only 10 African Countries out of 55 have developed National Action Plans as a means to implement the UNGPs at national levels. In the East and Horn of Africa, Kenya and Uganda have concluded and published a NAP, while the Tanzanian government has committed to developing a NAP. It is evident that the capacity to protect and respect human rights in the region has not kept up with the heightened economic activity, rapid business expansion and investor interest in the region.\n\nIt is against this background that countries from East and Horn of Africa converged in a two-day regional and national dialogue. The dialogue brought together Ministries, Departments, Government agencies, Business associations and Civil society to share progress, lessons and formulate strategies for the acceleration of development and implementation of NAPs.

Respect under UNGPs means that companies should not \u2018 infringe on the rights of others\u2019 and should \u2018 address adverse Human Rights impacts with which they are involved. This means that where a company identifies that it has caused, contributed or is directly linked to adverse rights impacts, it should provide a process of remediation through developing an OGM. The idea is that adverse impacts are addressed early and remediated directly.\n\nIn any business, adverse impacts may occur despite a commercial organisation\u2019s best efforts to prevent them. It is under this understanding that Kakuzi has developed and is implementing an OGM. The OGM is a means for individuals, workers, or communities who may be impacted by the activities of the business to raise complaints, questions, or concerns in order to get them addressed in a formal, prompt, and consistent manner. At Kakuzi, the OGM has been granted a local name SIKIKA, meaning \u201cto be heard\u201d. We have found that a local name enhances local ownership of the processes of SIKIKA.\n\nAdvertisement.

Tier 2 is for grievances that raise severe human rights impacts. For Tier 2, Kakuzi is in the process of establishing an Independent Human Rights Grievance Mechanism, which will be headed by an independent expert and assisted by a local advisory panel. Both Tiers take a victim-centered approach in resolving grievances by offering safeguards such as confidentiality, counseling and other measures as necessary.\n\nIn terms of lessons, we have found that implementation of OGMs increases internal knowledge on human rights and the capacity to reinforce a culture of respect for Human Rights. This is because while implementing OGMs you learn about the identification of impacts from a human rights lens, how to address them and how to prevent them. Integrating findings from this process can also inform change in policy and processes of a Company.\n\nThe level of documentation involved in implementing an OGM improves the quality of information available on the company\u2019s impacts. Effective tracking of impacts coupled with feedback from stakeholders can result into a solid process that not only addresses issues, but prevent recurring problems that are reported transparently to improve performance.\n\nAs a non-judicial, dialogue-based mechanism, OGM offer the prospects of an easier, quicker and more effective to complainants and can provide more appropriate case-specific solutions that enable victims and companies to move on with their lives.\n\nUltimately, the success of any grievance mechanism lies in its credibility, legitimacy and transparency.

We want to know what you will offer us as a region once you take over the government,\u201d he said.\n\nWhile accepting their defections, Ruto said that the leaders\u2019 move is wise since UDA\u2019s aim is to bring the country together for the \u201cunity of purpose\u201d.\n\n\u201cAs UDA, we welcome you to our camp, this country needs all MPs to come together for our common goal of liberating the poor from economic hardships,\u201d he said.\n\nUDA has settled on its likely candidate for a running mate post in the next election.\n\nThe clearest hint was given Saturday in Nyeri by DP Ruto that he will most likely pick on Mathira Member of Parliament Rigathi Gachagua as his running mate.\n\n\u201cI want to ask you for one favour, allow Gachagua to accompany me to other parts of the country so that we can be able to win this seat. Free him so that he can engage in national politics,\u201d Ruto told Nyeri residents Saturday during one of his many tours to the region.\n\nRuto said that Gachagua is one of his trusted ally and as such he would want him in his national campaign to boost his chances of becoming president next year.\n\nGachagua is seen as a powerful force in Central Kenya politics due his strong mobilisation skills and deep pockets even though he faces numerous corruption battles with the government.\n\nLoosely translated in politics, Ruto was asking the residents to allow the MP to play politics on the national stage as opposed to seeking any elective seat in the county or constituency.\n\nAdvertisement.
