Uhuru Kenyatta would by now be a lame-duck president operating in the shadows of his ambitious deputy William Ruto may have been forced to reassess their prediction by the recent turn of events.\n\nNever before in Kenya\u2019s independence history has a vice-president wielded more power than Ruto did during Jubilee Party\u2019s first term in office from 2013 to 2017.\n\nWith a constant presence by President Uhuru\u2019s side during that period, Ruto had a free hand in running ministries and was deeply involved in drawing up government programs and even supervising some.\n\nPolitical commentators, and some senior government officials, quietly referred to him as the power behind the throne, or even a co-president.\n\nJaramogi Oginga Odinga, 1963-1966\n\nOut of his 10 predecessors, no other vice-president, perhaps with the exception of Jaramogi Oginga Odinga, had the moral authority to exercise the kind of unrestrained power as Ruto did.\n\nJaramogi\u2019s moral authority emanated from the widely documented gesture of turning down the colonial government\u2019s offer to become Kenya\u2019s first prime minister in favor of Jomo Kenyatta, whom he felt was more deserving. Kenyatta was then in prison.\n\nRuto\u2019s moral authority came from the fact that he had sacrificed his presidential ambition in 2013 in favor of Uhuru.\n\nIn doing so, Ruto and his United Republican Party (URP) went into an equal partnership with Uhuru\u2019s The National Alliance (TNA) and defeated their main challenger Raila Odinga, who was vying under the Coalition for Reforms and Democracy (Cord) banner.\n\n2010 Constitution\n\nThe 2013 pre-election partnership agreement between URP and TNA gave Ruto control of half of the government posts, among them Cabinet secretaries, principal secretaries, ambassadors and state parastatals.\n\nJoseph Murumbi, 1966-1967\n\nAnd in the first term of the Jubilee administration, this is where Ruto\u2019s powers lay. However, many people misjudged these powers to emanate from his office as deputy president.\n\nThe 2010 Constitution made cosmetic changes to the Office of the deputy president \u2014 changing the name from vice-president and making it difficult for the president to fire his deputy on a whim.\n\nHowever, the deputy president\u2019s constitutional powers remained marginal, meaning the authority that Ruto exercised in Jubilee\u2019s first term was largely delegated to him by his boss.\n\nThe personal bond between the \u201cdynamic duo\u201d, as they were referred to by the media, had been strengthened by the criminal charges they were both facing at the International Criminal Court (ICC) arising from the 2007/2008 post-election violence.\n\nBut even during this time, a number of observers in Uhuru\u2019s inner circle had quietly voiced misgivings about the DP appearing to overreach himself.\n\nDaniel arap Moi. 1967-1978\n\nOne misgiving they pointed out early was the manner in which Ruto tended to hog the limelight during presidential functions, often speaking inordinately long while enumerating government projects and policies, and leaving his boss with little to say.\n\nMurathe warning\n\nIt is possible the President was not too pleased by his deputy\u2019s conduct but decided to play along for purposes of political expediency, mainly his 2017 re-election.\n\nOn hindsight, a hint of Uhuru\u2019s displeasure came from Jubilee Party vice-chairman David Murathe, who just before the August 7, 2017, General Election, told a local TV station that Uhuru would be more assertive in his second term.\n\n\u201cI am very sorry for people if Uhuru gets re-elected,\u201d Murathe told KTN, \u201cBecause his agenda will be his legacy issues which will be anchored in law, order, discipline and the fight against corruption.\u201d\n\nMwai Kibaki. 1978-1988\n\nAt the time, many thought the words were directed at opposition leaders, mainly Raila, who, just like in 2013, was Uhuru\u2019s main challenger in the 2017 election.\n\nLooking at it now, this statement perhaps signalled President Uhuru\u2019s intention to take back the powers he had donated to his deputy in his first term.\n\nThe President\u2019s first move was to name his a new Cabinet alone at State House after what appeared to have been a tussle with his deputy over names of new Cabinet Secretaries.\n\nRuto kept away from the function, unlike in 2013 when the newly-elected leaders, clad in matching white shirts and red ties, named the Cabinet at State House.\n\nThe President\u2019s second move was the March 2018 Handshake with Raila, an event that is said to have caught the DP unawares and which has since bitterly divided the Jubilee Party.\n\nThe President then followed with a call that Jubilee leaders should cease premature political campaigns which had been stirred by the Handshake.\n\nJosephat Karanja, 1988-1989\n\nHis call was largely seen as aimed at the DP whom Uhuru derided for \u201ctanga tanga\u201d (wandering aimlessly) all over the country.\n\nChurch fundraisers\n\nEither by design or default, this statement seemed to have provided the cue to Cabinet Secretaries, Principal Secretaries and heads of parastatals to give a wide berth to the DP\u2019s countrywide tours in the name of launching government projects.\n\nWhen this line was cut off, Ruto converted his \u201cdevelopment tours\u201d to church fundraisers which allowed him to travel around the country and sell his agenda, without seeking the blessings of his boss.\n\nAt the same time, his lieutenants in Parliament upped their raw criticism of the President and the Building Bridges Initiative (BBI) which Uhuru launched with Raila as a follow up to the Handshake.\n\nGeorge Saitoti. 1989-2002\n\nAt the same time, the DP and his foot soldiers in Parliament openly ciriticised what they termed as President Uhuru\u2019s partisan war on corruption which they claimed was targeting Ruto and his allies.\n\nConsequently, it forced the DP and his lieutenants take positions on the war on graft that were sometimes not only at variance with Uhuru\u2019s stand, but also public opinion.\n\nThe DP even took it upon himself to criticize public institutions involved in the fight against the vice, thus raising questions about his allegiance.\n\nMusalia Mudavadi, 2002-2002\n\nHe memorably differed with the Director of Criminal Investigations George Kinoti, over the amount of money lost in the Arror and Kimwarer dam scandals, arguing that the DCI was being used to settle political scores.\n\nCorruption war\n\nIn the impeachment of Kiambu Governor Ferdinand Waititu and the prosecution of Nairobi Governor Mike Sonko, the DP\u2019s lieutenants rushed to their defence and even appeared for them in court.\n\nMany saw this as a bold attempt by the DP and his allies to undermine the President on the war on corruption, a fact that some of the DP\u2019s allies loudly proclaimed in public forums.\n\nWith an eye on the 2022 presidential race, in 2016, Ruto engineered the merger of URP, TNA and other smaller parties to the Jubilee Party, despite disquiet from his Kalenjin political base.\n\nKijana Wamalwa. 2003- 2003\n\nThe thinking at the time was that it would be easier to sell Ruto\u2019s presidential candidature in Mt Kenya through a single unified party rather than through Jubilee\u2019s former affiliates.\n\nBut given the happenings in the Jubilee Party, this is a decision that the DP must be regretting.

Kenyatta was then in prison.</p>\n\n<p>Ruto\u2019s moral authority came from the fact that he had sacrificed his presidential ambition in 2013 in favor of Uhuru.</p>\n\n<p>In doing so, Ruto and his United Republican Party (URP) went into an equal partnership with Uhuru\u2019s The National Alliance (TNA) and defeated their main challenger Raila Odinga, who was vying under the Coalition for Reforms and Democracy (Cord) banner.</p>\n\n<p>2010 Constitution</p>\n\n<p>The 2013 pre-election partnership agreement between URP and TNA gave Ruto control of half of the government posts, among them Cabinet secretaries, principal secretaries, ambassadors and state parastatals.</p>\n\n<p>Joseph Murumbi, 1966-1967</p>\n\n<p>And in the first term of the Jubilee administration, this is where Ruto\u2019s powers lay. However, many people misjudged these powers to emanate from his office as deputy president.</p>\n\n<p>The 2010 Constitution made cosmetic changes to the Office of the deputy president \u2014 changing the name from vice-president and making it difficult for the president to fire his deputy on a whim.</p>\n\n<p>However, the deputy president\u2019s constitutional powers remained marginal, meaning the authority that Ruto exercised in Jubilee\u2019s first term was largely delegated to him by his boss.</p>\n\n<p>The personal bond between the \u201cdynamic duo\u201d, as they were referred to by the media, had been strengthened by the criminal charges they were both facing at the International Criminal Court (ICC) arising from the 2007/2008 post-election violence.</p>\n\n<p>But even during this time, a number of observers in Uhuru\u2019s inner circle had quietly voiced misgivings about the DP appearing to overreach himself.</p>\n\n<p>Daniel arap Moi. 1967-1978</p>\n\n<p>One misgiving they pointed out early was the manner in which Ruto tended to hog the limelight during presidential functions, often speaking inordinately long while enumerating government projects and policies, and leaving his boss with little to say.</p>\n\n<p>Murathe warning</p>\n\n<p>It is possible the President was not too pleased by his deputy\u2019s conduct but decided to play along for purposes of political expediency, mainly his 2017 re-election.</p>\n\n<p>On hindsight, a hint of Uhuru\u2019s displeasure came from Jubilee Party vice-chairman David Murathe, who just before the August 7, 2017, General Election, told a local TV station that Uhuru would be more assertive in his second term.</p>\n\n<p>\u201cI am very sorry for people if Uhuru gets re-elected,\u201d Murathe told KTN, \u201cBecause his agenda will be his legacy issues which will be anchored in law, order, discipline and the fight against corruption.\u201d</p>\n\n<p>Mwai Kibaki. 1978-1988</p>\n\n<p>At the time, many thought the words were directed at opposition leaders, mainly Raila, who, just like in 2013, was Uhuru\u2019s main challenger in the 2017 election.</p>\n\n<p>Looking at it now, this statement perhaps signalled President Uhuru\u2019s intention to take back the powers he had donated to his deputy in his first term.</p>\n\n<p>The President\u2019s first move was to name his a new Cabinet alone at State House after what appeared to have been a tussle with his deputy over names of new Cabinet Secretaries.</p>\n\n<p>Ruto kept away from the function, unlike in 2013 when the newly-elected leaders, clad in matching white shirts and red ties, named the Cabinet at State House.</p>\n\n<p>The President\u2019s second move was the March 2018 Handshake with Raila, an event that is said to have caught the DP unawares and which has since bitterly divided the Jubilee Party.</p>\n\n<p>The President then followed with a call that Jubilee leaders should cease premature political campaigns which had been stirred by the Handshake.</p>\n\n<p>Josephat Karanja, 1988-1989</p>\n\n<p>His call was largely seen as aimed at the DP whom Uhuru derided for \u201ctanga tanga\u201d (wandering aimlessly) all over the country.</p>\n\n<p>Church fundraisers</p>\n\n<p>Either by design or default, this statement seemed to have provided the cue to Cabinet Secretaries, Principal Secretaries and heads of parastatals to give a wide berth to the DP\u2019s countrywide tours in the name of launching government projects.</p>\n\n<p>When this line was cut off, Ruto converted his \u201cdevelopment tours\u201d to church fundraisers which allowed him to travel around the country and sell his agenda, without seeking the blessings of his boss.</p>\n\n<p>At the same time, his lieutenants in Parliament upped their raw criticism of the President and the Building Bridges Initiative (BBI) which Uhuru launched with Raila as a follow up to the Handshake.</p>\n\n<p>George Saitoti. 1989-2002</p>\n\n<p>At the same time, the DP and his foot soldiers in Parliament openly ciriticised what they termed as President Uhuru\u2019s partisan war on corruption which they claimed was targeting Ruto and his allies.</p>\n\n<p>Consequently, it forced the DP and his lieutenants take positions on the war on graft that were sometimes not only at variance with Uhuru\u2019s stand, but also public opinion.</p>\n\n<p>The DP even took it upon himself to criticize public institutions involved in the fight against the vice, thus raising questions about his allegiance.</p>\n\n<p>Musalia Mudavadi, 2002-2002</p>\n\n<p>He memorably differed with the Director of Criminal Investigations George Kinoti, over the amount of money lost in the Arror and Kimwarer dam scandals, arguing that the DCI was being used to settle political scores.</p>\n\n<p>Corruption war</p>\n\n<p>In the impeachment of Kiambu Governor Ferdinand Waititu and the prosecution of Nairobi Governor Mike Sonko, the DP\u2019s lieutenants rushed to their defence and even appeared for them in court.</p>\n\n<p>Many saw this as a bold attempt by the DP and his allies to undermine the President on the war on corruption, a fact that some of the DP\u2019s allies loudly proclaimed in public forums.</p>\n\n<p>With an eye on the 2022 presidential race, in 2016, Ruto engineered the merger of URP, TNA and other smaller parties to the Jubilee Party, despite disquiet from his Kalenjin political base.</p>\n\n<p>Kijana Wamalwa. 2003- 2003</p>\n\n<p>The thinking at the time was that it would be easier to sell Ruto\u2019s presidential candidature in Mt Kenya through a single unified party rather than through Jubilee\u2019s former affiliates.</p>\n\n<p>But given the happenings in the Jubilee Party, this is a decision that the DP must be regretting. The TNA-URP merger effectively ended the 2013 pre-election pact between Uhuru and Ruto which had given the latter half of the government where he drew his real power over the first five years. With the merger, the DP had surrendered the strongest leverage he had over the President.</p>\n\n<p>President Kenyatta, who is also the Jubilee Party leader, has deployed key his lieutenants within the party to carry out the recent coup against the DP\u2019s allies in the Senate.</p>\n\n<p>Moody Awori. 2003-2008</p>\n\n<p>Under the President\u2019s instructions, Jubilee replaced Elgeyo Marakwet Senator Kipchumba Murkomen as Majority Leader and his Nakuru counterpart Susan Kihika as Chief Whip.

Justice position by the Judicial Service Commission\u2019s vetting panel.\n\nJennifer Shamalla dismissed fears expressed by Ngatia\u2019s critics who are concerned that since he has acted as a lawyer for Uhuru in the past, this might make him an unsuitable Chief Justice, citing possible bias.\n\nSpeaking yesterday on KTN News\u2019 political show NewsNight hosted by Ben Kitili, Jennifer Shamalla reminded the rest that even former Chief Justice David Maraga, who is now hailed as a model Chief Justice by many, had his own unsavory past.\n\nReferring to a ruling Maraga made when he was still a High Court judge in Nakuru, Shamalla said it should be remembered that Maraga freed four suspects who were accused of burning the Kiambaa Church during the 2007-08 post-election violence.\n\nThousands of civilians, including women and children, died when marauding militias set fire to the Kenya Assemblies of God church in the northern city of Eldoret, where they were sheltering from the clashes. The deaths took place on 1 January, 2008, and four suspects were charged two months later but Justice David Maraga said he had to drop the case, citing lack of evidence and shoddy police investigations.\n\nBack in 2016, when appearing before MPs for vetting, then Chief Justice nominee David Maraga struggled to explain himself against allegations he failed to serve justice in the famous judgement.\n\nWhen he appeared before MPs for vetting, Justice Maraga was pressed to explain his decision not to convict anyone during the attack on Kiambaa church at the height of the 2007/2008 post-election violence.\n\nUnder intense questioning by the Justice and Legal Affairs Committee led by then Ainabkoi MP Samuel Chepkonga, the judge stood his ground.\nCommittee vice-person Priscilla Nyokabi (Nyeri County MP) raised the matter of Kiambaa Church arson case and demanded to know why the suspects were acquitted.\n\nJustice Maraga said: \u201cI handled the\u2026 Kiambaa at the\u2026 time.

And as things go, there may be a small window left to rescue both his career and the destiny of Somalia.\n\nOn Tuesday, the latest ominous sign came from a grouping of Hawiye clan members and professionals. Gathering in Mogadishu, they withdrew support for Farmaajo, expressing fury at his decisions to assent to the term extension motion of parliament.\n\nA voice emerged from 400 delegates of Mogadishu\u2019s most prominent clan with interests in politics and businesses which means they have sufficient influence in the capital. The participants include two ex-Presidents, a former PM, opposition and youth leaders as well as other special interest groups.\n\nWell, some have argued perhaps correctly that the clan as a unit of politics in Somalia may be behind the perennial chaos.\n\nBut Somalia\u2019s nascent democracy borrows from its culture and history, which means that every son and daughter the clans have brought up to serve their country considers their class as the basic politics. It is the way Somalis have organized themselves for centuries and it is why we cannot throw away the bathwater with the baby.\n\nThis is why the clan, no matter its shortcomings in other times, will remain influential in Somali politics and any leader who ignores it perishes politically. For the Hawiye specifically, their influence in Mogadishu means that any changes in the political stability of the country affect them directly and their influence in Mogadishu means that ay changes in the political stability of the country affect them directly and their displeasure simply means one bigger door has been slammed in Farmaajo\u2019s face.\n\nThere have been other protestants more directly from Farmaajo\u2019s rival in the presidential contest. This week the National Salvation Forum warned of political instability as the term extension goes on. And Presidents of Galmudung, Hirshabelle And South West have recently come under pressure from their own clans to clarify their positions.

Even at our current moment in time we have seen the Arab Spring that has entangled countries of the Middle East and Northern Africa which has seen war and suffering as they spoke out and demanded change.</p>\n\n<p>What would have happened if they sat back on their dear beds with phones and laptops to start tweeting and commenting on anything and everything they see go through social media. Pretty much nothing. This is the situation of people in Kenya who claim they are revolutionists in the comfort of their bedsitters, in the comfort of their warm and cozy homes who spend the better part of their day and night looking for quotable quotes and tweetable tweets. The revolutionists who cannot even raise their voice on anything. They label themselves as fighters through cartoon characters of past revolutionists on their profile pictures but cannot even stand the raging sun outside, cannot gather masses and most of all, find it down right ridiculous to carry placards, screaming and shouting to capture the attention of those they want. The farthest they can do is air their views and noise through paragraphs on social media sites away from the heat, the noise and especially away from the face of the police.</p>\n\n<p>Their revolution is an open fallacy to gain clout and popularity and start making money online through following because at the end of the day they are only engaging in a selfish undertaking. There is no revolution here but a money making venture, no more no less.</p>\n\n</article>", "canonicalUrl": "https://www.reactorreview.com/?p=28899"},{"url": "https://www.reactorreview.com/?cat=10", "probability": 0.8256795, "headline": "Leave Fred Ngatia alone, even Maraga acquitted Kiambaa Church massacre perpetrator- Shamalla", "datePublished": "2021-04-21T00:00:00", "datePublishedRaw": "Apr 21, 2021", "author": "admin", "authorsList": ["admin"], "inLanguage": "en", "mainImage": "https://i0.wp.com/www.reactorreview.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/PEV_victims.jpg.771x441_q85_crop-smart.jpg?resize=450%2C299&ssl=1", "images": ["https://i0.wp.com/www.reactorreview.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/PEV_victims.jpg.771x441_q85_crop-smart.jpg?resize=450%2C299&ssl=1", "https://i1.wp.com/www.reactorreview.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/77A6C74A-2142-4A12-BA30-A2520B3A5911.jpeg?resize=1080%2C675&ssl=1", "https://i0.wp.com/www.reactorreview.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/IMG_20210421_063555.jpg?resize=1080%2C592&ssl=1", "https://i2.wp.com/www.reactorreview.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/IMG_20210420_093439.jpg?resize=1080%2C675&ssl=1", "https://i1.wp.com/www.reactorreview.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/FB_IMG_1573887109367.jpg?resize=581%2C363&ssl=1", "https://i0.wp.com/www.reactorreview.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/IMG_20210420_082048.jpg?resize=1080%2C524&ssl=1"], "description": "Siasa", "articleBody": "Popular Nominated MP Jennifer Shamalla yesterday moved to throw a spanner in the works as regarding debate on Lawyer Fred Nga\u2019tia who, hours earlier, had been interviewed for the Chief Justice position by the Judicial Service Commission\u2019s vetting panel.\n\nJennifer Shamalla dismissed fears expressed by Ngatia\u2019s critics who are concerned that since he has acted as a lawyer for Uhuru in the past, this might make him an unsuitable Chief Justice, citing possible bias.\n\nSpeaking yesterday on KTN News\u2019 political show NewsNight hosted by Ben Kitili, Jennifer Shamalla reminded the rest that even former Chief Justice David Maraga, who is now hailed as a model Chief Justice by many, had his own unsavory past.\n\nReferring to a ruling Maraga made when he was still a High Court judge in Nakuru, Shamalla said it should be remembered that Maraga freed four suspects who were accused of burning the Kiambaa Church during the 2007-08 post-election violence.\n\nThousands of civilians, including women and children, died when marauding militias set fire to the Kenya Assemblies of God church in the northern city of Eldoret, where they were sheltering from the clashes. The deaths took place on 1 January, 2008, and four suspects were charged two months later but Justice David Maraga said he had to drop the case, citing lack of evidence and shoddy police investigations.\n\nBack in 2016, when appearing before MPs for vetting, then Chief Justice nominee David Maraga struggled to explain himself against allegations he failed to serve justice in the famous judgement.\n\nWhen he appeared before MPs for vetting, Justice Maraga was pressed to explain his decision not to convict anyone during the attack on Kiambaa church at the height of the 2007/2008 post-election violence.\n\nUnder intense questioning by the Justice and Legal Affairs Committee led by then Ainabkoi MP Samuel Chepkonga, the judge stood his ground.\nCommittee vice-person Priscilla Nyokabi (Nyeri County MP) raised the matter of Kiambaa Church arson case and demanded to know why the suspects were acquitted.\n\nJustice Maraga said: \u201cI handled the\u2026 Kiambaa at the\u2026 time. Our judgement is not based on emotions but on evidence and the law. I also lamented over poor investigations. There was no evidence to sustain a conviction.\u201d\n\nJubilee Turf Wars! Uhuru\u2019s Jubilee Party declares total war on DP Ruto\u2019s UDA\n\nTweet\n\nPresident Uhuru Kenyatta\u2019s Jubilee has taken on Deputy President William Ruto-backed United Democratic Alliance (UDA), with a plot to terminate a pre-election agreement with the rebranded party.\n\nJubilee has insisted it signed a pre-election pact with Party for Development and Reforms (PDR), which rebranded to UDA, and is therefore considered a new entity.\n\nAnd if it goes ahead and severs ties with UDA, MPs allied to Ruto who are openly associating with the new party, citing the coalition agreement, would be exposed legally.\n\nAccording to the Political Parties Act, a party member who promotes the affairs of another outfit risks disciplinary action, punishment the President\u2019s camp would not hesitate to initiate against rebels as the relations with his deputy continue to deteriorate.\n\n\u201cIt is dishonest to say we are in the same coalition (with UDA). It is a hostile coalition. It is hostile in Parliament. It cannot be allowed to continue,\u201d Jubilee secretary-general Raphael Tuju recently submitted to the Political Parties Disputes Tribunal where he defended the party\u2019s decision to expel nominated Senator Isaac Mwaura for his association with UDA.\n\nBut Dr Ruto has dismissed such claims, insisting that UDA\u2019s agreement with Jubilee is still valid.\n\nCoalition agreement\n\n\u201cUDA and Jubilee are one. We have a coalition agreement and we have been working together. If they break Jubilee, trying to make it a tribal party, we will build UDA as the national party we had hoped Jubilee will be,\u201d Dr Ruto said last month.\n\nAnd last Thursday, the DP cautioned Jubilee has itself to blame for what he said will be an avalanche of defections to UDA. \u201cIn the event Jubilee is not available, we will have a plan B. UDA is the next best option as it is already working with Jubilee. It will become an option if Jubilee does not stop this expulsion spree.\u201d\n\nThe DP\u2019s allies, too, insist they have done nothing wrong in associating with an affiliate of Jubilee.\n\n\u201cAs far as I am concerned, I am still a Jubilee member. I may not agree with what Jubilee is doing, but I am a member. I have no apologies to make for associating with UDA. I am a firm believer that you cannot stop anyone from associating with anybody,\u201d Meru senator Mithika Linturi said yesterday.\n\nThe ruling party, however, argues that it was disingenuous for the Ruto team to be in both parties at the same time, and that they should resign to seek a fresh mandate in the new UDA party.\n\nA Northern Kenya based party, PDR, now UDA, worked with Jubilee at a time President Kenyatta preferred such working relationships to shore up his support in regions where Jubilee was not the most preferred party.\n\nUDA now has five elected leaders in Parliament led by Senate Deputy Majority Leader Fatuma Dullo, who is also the Isiolo senator, as well as Wajir Woman Rep Fatuma Gedi, Tarbaj\u2019s Ahmed Bashane, Mark Lomunokol of Kacheliba and Ijara\u2019s Sophia Abdi.\n\nPolitical moves\n\nThe Nation has learnt that the DP instructed his allies during a meeting at his Karen home recently to help the UDA leadership in constituting the party coordinators from the constituency to county level ahead of the party\u2019s June 18 grassroots polls.\n\nSouth Mugirango MP Sylvanus Osoro and his Keiyo South counterpart Daniel Rono confirmed to the Nation that they were told to ensure that the party has interim officials ready to register members.\n\n\u201cWe were restructuring our political moves by endeavouring to expand our networks from the grassroots level,\u201d said Mr Osoro.\n\n\u201cLeaders agreed to consult further and constitute party coordinators in their areas so that we can soldier on and minimise unnecessary fights. Having the officials will help us register as many members as possible to outsmart Jubilee party,\u201d Mr Rono added.\n\nUDA has proposed a power-sharing model in its top party leadership structures.\n\nIn a draft UDA constitution seen by the Nation, the outfit proposes to have three deputy party leaders, three deputy chairpersons, three deputy secretaries-general, three deputy national treasurers, and three deputy national organising secretaries.\n\nOne Kenya Alliance Seeks To Widen The Coalition even as DP Ruto says its no match for his UDA\n\nOne Kenya Alliance principals Gideon Moi (KANU), Musalia Mudavadi (ANC), Kalonzo Musyoka (Wiper) and Moses Wetangula (Ford Kenya) have agreed to widen the coalition with like-minded political players ahead of the 2022 high stake General Election.\n\nThe leaders held a two-hour consultative meeting on Tuesday in which they agreed to form a technical working team that would come up with modalities of accommodating other political players.\n\n\u201cWe had a meeting to reflect on further steps to be undertaken in the coming weeks to strengthen and broaden the emerging political formation of One Kenya Alliance,\u201d Mudavadi said.\n\nThe leaders, who have remained committal that their alliance is primarily aimed at uniting Kenyans, have in recent days been on the receiving end with some of their critics accusing them of being propped by President Uhuru Kenyatta ahead of the polls to tame the influence of ODM Party Leader Raila Odinga and Deputy President William Ruto.\n\n\u201cToday we mark the beginning of a journey with a clear purpose to unite this country through a transformative agenda that seeks to create equal opportunities for all Kenyans,\u201d the leaders said during its launch in March 2021.\n\nThe former Prime Minister Odinga enjoyed a previous political pact with Mudavadi, Musyoka and Wetangula in the now defunct National Super Alliance (NASA). He was deliberately left out of the equation in what is largely attributed to his \u2018insincerity\u2019 to honor coalition agreements.\n\nThe ODM Party Leader who is yet to formally announce his presidential bid although his allies have hinted that he will be on the ballot has since dismissed the alliance and termed it \u201ca tribal alliance\u201d.\n\nDeputy President William Ruto who is also eyeing the presidency has accused the quartet of banking on tribal politics to get power instead of championing for a national party with an ideology to unite all Kenyans.\n\nTalk has been rife in recent days of a political formation between Raila and Ruto though the two arch-rivals have dismissed the talk.\n\nRuto in a past interview revealed that the differences between him and the ODM leader were purely political and noted that in the event the former premier gets to adopt his hustler ideology then there could be room for a working arrangement.\n\n\u201cOur differences are only political and if people share ideas then room for engagement should never be dismissed,\u201d he said.\n\nKakamega Governor Wycliffe Oparanya who also doubles up as the ODM Party Leader recently met Ruto in what ignited talk of the possibility of a Raila-Ruto alliance.\n\nThe One Kenya Alliance political outfit is among the three others that are angling for President Uhuru Kenyatta\u2019s endorsement for the 2022 presidential election.\n\nDeeply Entrenched In Crime; How William Ruto Operates\n\nTweet\n\nBeyond reproach, uncouth, insolent and self-centred individuals. They lack respect, are deceitful and work towards sabotaging good while glorifying evil. They have become grand conmen and grandmasters in corruption be it in acquiring fictitious tenders, fraud and money laundering, open theft of public funds and a total elimination of human obstacles through planned killings.\n\nThese individuals care for nothing else but their pockets and their ambitions which must not be cutailed by anything or anyone otherwise any threat is squarely eliminated. Their presennce is embued with the aroma of evil.\n\nBut who are they? Who seeks to scare Kenyans and plunge the country into fear, chaos and calamity through their economic and political ambitions? These are William Ruto and his foot soldiers as this revelation chooses not to disgrace the title \u2018Deputy President\u2019 as there have been commendable ones before in the same positions and there will be many others later. These men have committed atrocities that have ranged from attempted economic sabotage, attempted political sabotage and even social with the attempted sparking of class wars in the country between those considered \u2018rich\u2019 and those considered \u2018poor\u2019 from an individual who falsely claims he wants peace in the country.\n\nListing them they include the likes of Rigathi Gaachagua who stole from Nyeri County as he brother slowly deteriorated and died of cancer, Farouk Kibet who is well vast with covering up tracing of Ruto in a number of gruesome murders, Mwangi Kiunjuri who instituted a well crafted maize scandal that led to the loss of billions meant for farmers, Rashid Echesa who is a political goon and has also been involved in a series of corruption scandals including the fake arms scandal that saw a Ruto aide Sgt Kenei murdered with Ruto playing the \u2018I don\u2019t know what happened\u2019 game.\n\nOscar Sudi who is adversely mentioned in the Arror Kimwarer dams scandal that led to the loss of over SH21billion, Kimani Ngunjiri who learning from his master Ruto has been implicated in a trail of land fraud and even grabbed land from an elderly woman. Don Bpsco Gichana who is an expert in money laundering alongside Echesa and a gold racketeer in addition to being a conman, Zaheer Jhanda another serious money launderer alongside fraud who are key in hiding Ruto\u2019s loot from public coffers amounting in billions by engaging in his fake gold business and Moses Kuria who has wiped the Gatundu South NGCDF belonging to his consttituents and distributed the tenders amongst his family members who have largely not delivered projects but promises with money pocketed.\n\nThese are the individuals that claim are leaders. Lost in their world of greed and loot with Ruto not seeing Kenyans but seeing vaults containing public funds and reserves and relishing the moment it will all be his. Havent\u2019s you seen him even grab Sh100 million worth of land from an old man, Adrian Muteshi who eventually died? This is factual. We can only imagine the enomity of the stress this man had as he fought for what rightfully belonged to him. Evil evil and more evil. The stench is unbearable and no Kenyan can stand this level of ruthlessness.\n\nParliament Has No Power To Alter Wanjiku\u2019s BBI Views\n\nby admin | Apr 20, 2021 | Features, Politics, Politics\n\nTweet\n\nA few days ago, the promoters of the Building Bridges Initiative (BBI) constitutional amendment bill announced the referendum would be in August. This is after it dawned on them the initial June date was no longer realistic.\n\nThey cited the delay by the Nation al Assembly and the Senate to pass the bill. And now some of the BBI bill promoters are pushing for reopening of the report, a move that will definitely derail the process further. The BBI bill had earlier been tabled before county assemblies and received overwhelming support. The assemblies complied with Article 257 of the Constitution which outlines a\nroadmap of amending the Constitution through the popular initiative.\n\nUnder this law, the hands of the legislative bodies, both at county and national levels are tied. They have no power to alter or add a coma or fullstop to a bill that originates from views of the people. The county assemblies had two options: to either adopt or reject the bill submitted to them by the Independent Electoral and Boundaries Commission.\n\nThe National Assembly and the Senate had a similar role. However, even if the two Houses rejected the original BBI bill, it wouldn\u2019t stop the IEBC from going ahead with referendum plans. Kenyans will have the final say.\n\nPresident Uhuru Kenyatta and his Handshake partner Raila Odinga are the key drivers of the BBI process. However, going by latest political events, it seems one or both of them has/have changed mind. They no longer lead the BBI process with same vigour and energy they exhibited at the start of the journey.\n\nBesides their allies are now rooting for the reopening of bill and if they have eventually have their way, then the BBI bill would no longer be a popular document. Well, one of the key proposals that the MPs, who are pushing for the reopening of BBI report, are uncomfortable with is that of increasing the number of constituencies. Central Kenya is highly populated and hence it is set to receive the lion\u2019s share of the 70 additional parliamentary seats.\n\nThe BBI bill has no clause suggesting the power to create new electoral units would be taken away from IEBC. Once adopted, the commission will still exercise this power. In the event that the document is reopened, we would result in two documents, one passed by county assemblies and the amended version endorsed by two Houses of Parliament.\n\nSo which bill will be presented to Kenyans at the referendum? Further, this would give the anti BBI team more grounds to challenge the legality of the process in court. One wonders why the same proponents of the constitution amendment initiative would want to offend the same supreme law of the land they seek to make better.\n\nRemember how Raila allies repeatedly countered the narrative of cost of a referendum, arguing that Kenyans stand to gain more if BBI sailed through? What has changed? Kenyans deserve better leadership, please!\n\nRuto\u2019s Politics of His Pocket and His Ambitions; Well Clothed in Sheep\u2019s Skin\n\nby admin | Apr 20, 2021 | Politics\n\nHe started out by pretending not to take a stand as he weighed his options seeing that Kenya had accepted the crucial document. He was looking for a loophole on how he would make it as a likely savior for Kenyans in his deceptive manner through his hustler coined campaigns. He pretended to be for it but went out in his campaigns castigating the initiative stating that it would divide Kenyans yet he knew this was the ultimate strategy to bring lasting unity in the country and would definitely destroy him and his political ambitions as his strategy was that of divide and rule which he had vigorously began dividing Kenyans in classes but fortunately for Kenyans, this was extinguished before it brought another havoc and war in the country.\n\nWith a failed strategy, Ruto continued with his pretence on vouching for the Building Bridges Initiative riding on unity and refusing to admit to even his own supporters that he was discontent on the level of achievement the initiative had brought.\n\nHe is even quoted saying,\n\n\u201cI have a constitutional duty to assist my boss, the president. [But did you?] Now working on consensus for Kenyans to have real choices to decide/vote while avoiding yes/no or /nothing division. We avoided lose-lose we can overcome win-lose to achieve win-win,\u201d he said.\n\nThis was a his way of giving meaningless talk as his statement was non-comprehensive to even his own hustler supporters giving a picture of a man who is playing ball with the minds of Kenyans. Moreover, ever since the inception of the handshake, he has for ever critiqued the President\u2019s efforts in attaining unity and development in the country and choosing to sabotage and cause division in the country.\n\nThe same man who had cited that BBI had improved after Bomas claiming cooperation between him and the President through consensus building is the same individual who later castigated the initiative, For him he was looking for opportunities to gain popularity by dissuading Kenyans from the actual truth and feeding them with lies.\n\nHe instructed his allies to tarnish the document as smiled quietly i nthe background, which is why there were instances of individuals singing along to BBI and vowing total support and with the same mouth belonging to Senator Kipchumba Murkomen spitting venom against it and saying that it is the devil despite the lasting unity it is poised to bring in the country. Moses Kuria and Boni Khalwale have done the same before and after the launch of the BBI. With the overwhelming support BBI had garnered they pretended to be in support as the masses that they were looking for were behind it.\n\nThis pretence is what must be nipped in the bud. Ruto and his ilk have no stand on anything but are only moved where the money and the masses are. Everything they do has nothing to do with their paid hustler supporters and nothing done out of selfishness can succeed be it a revolution of any kind.", "articleBodyHtml": "<article>\n\n<figure><a href=\"https://www.reactorreview.com/?p=28992\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<img src=\"https://i0.wp.com/www.reactorreview.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/PEV_victims.jpg.771x441_q85_crop-smart.jpg?resize=450%2C299&amp;ssl=1\" alt=\"Leave Fred Ngatia alone, even Maraga acquitted Kiambaa Church massacre perpetrator- Shamalla\">\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</a></figure>\n\n<p>Popular Nominated MP Jennifer Shamalla yesterday moved to throw a spanner in the works as regarding debate on Lawyer Fred Nga\u2019tia who, hours earlier, had been interviewed for the Chief Justice position by the Judicial Service Commission\u2019s vetting panel.</p>\n\n<p>Jennifer Shamalla dismissed fears expressed by Ngatia\u2019s critics who are concerned that since he has acted as a lawyer for Uhuru in the past, this might make him an unsuitable Chief Justice, citing possible bias.</p>\n\n<p>Speaking yesterday on KTN News\u2019 political show NewsNight hosted by Ben Kitili, Jennifer Shamalla reminded the rest that even former Chief Justice David Maraga, who is now hailed as a model Chief Justice by many, had his own unsavory past.</p>\n\n<p>Referring to a ruling Maraga made when he was still a High Court judge in Nakuru, Shamalla said it should be remembered that Maraga freed four suspects who were accused of burning the Kiambaa Church during the 2007-08 post-election violence.</p>\n\n<p>Thousands of civilians, including women and children, died when marauding militias set fire to the Kenya Assemblies of God church in the northern city of Eldoret, where they were sheltering from the clashes.

Lost in their world of greed and loot with Ruto not seeing Kenyans but seeing vaults containing public funds and reserves and relishing the moment it will all be his. Havent\u2019s you seen him even grab Sh100 million worth of land from an old man, Adrian Muteshi who eventually died? This is factual.

He was looking for a loophole on how he would make it as a likely savior for Kenyans in his deceptive manner through his hustler coined campaigns. He pretended to be for it but went out in his campaigns castigating the initiative stating that it would divide Kenyans yet he knew this was the ultimate strategy to bring lasting unity in the country and would definitely destroy him and his political ambitions as his strategy was that of divide and rule which he had vigorously began dividing Kenyans in classes but fortunately for Kenyans, this was extinguished before it brought another havoc and war in the country.</p>\n\n<p>With a failed strategy, Ruto continued with his pretence on vouching for the Building Bridges Initiative riding on unity and refusing to admit to even his own supporters that he was discontent on the level of achievement the initiative had brought.</p>\n\n<p>He is even quoted saying,</p>\n\n<p>\u201cI have a constitutional duty to assist my boss, the president. [But did you?] Now working on consensus for Kenyans to have real choices to decide/vote while avoiding yes/no or /nothing division. We avoided lose-lose we can overcome win-lose to achieve win-win,\u201d he said.</p>\n\n<p>This was a his way of giving meaningless talk as his statement was non-comprehensive to even his own hustler supporters giving a picture of a man who is playing ball with the minds of Kenyans. Moreover, ever since the inception of the handshake, he has for ever critiqued the President\u2019s efforts in attaining unity and development in the country and choosing to sabotage and cause division in the country.</p>\n\n<p>The same man who had cited that BBI had improved after Bomas claiming cooperation between him and the President through consensus building is the same individual who later castigated the initiative, For him he was looking for opportunities to gain popularity by dissuading Kenyans from the actual truth and feeding them with lies.</p>\n\n<p>He instructed his allies to tarnish the document as smiled quietly i nthe background, which is why there were instances of individuals singing along to BBI and vowing total support and with the same mouth belonging to Senator Kipchumba Murkomen spitting venom against it and saying that it is the devil despite the lasting unity it is poised to bring in the country. Moses Kuria and Boni Khalwale have done the same before and after the launch of the BBI. With the overwhelming support BBI had garnered they pretended to be in support as the masses that they were looking for were behind it.</p>\n\n<p>This pretence is what must be nipped in the bud. Ruto and his ilk have no stand on anything but are only moved where the money and the masses are. Everything they do has nothing to do with their paid  hustler supporters and nothing done out of selfishness can succeed be it a revolution of any kind.</p>\n\n</article>"},{"url": "https://www.reactorreview.com/?cat=20", "probability": 0.8928173, "headline": "To Uplifting the Poor and Vulnerable, Let Us Do More To Improve Social Protection Service Delivery", "datePublished": "2021-04-22T00:00:00", "datePublishedRaw": "Apr 22, 2021", "author": "admin", "authorsList": ["admin"], "inLanguage": "en", "mainImage": "https://i2.wp.com/www.reactorreview.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/kenya-results.png?resize=780%2C439&ssl=1", "images": ["https://i2.wp.com/www.reactorreview.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/kenya-results.png?resize=780%2C439&ssl=1", "https://i2.wp.com/www.reactorreview.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/IMG_20210422_084451.jpg?resize=582%2C415&ssl=1", "https://i2.wp.com/www.reactorreview.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/IMG_20210420_093439.jpg?resize=1080%2C675&ssl=1", "https://i0.wp.com/www.reactorreview.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/IMG_20210422_064310.jpg?resize=1080%2C675&ssl=1", "https://i2.wp.com/www.reactorreview.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/IMG_20210419_103041.jpg?resize=713%2C562&ssl=1", "https://i0.wp.com/www.reactorreview.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/IMG_20210416_073346.jpg?resize=1080%2C528&ssl=1"], "description": "The Kenya National Safety Net Programme (NSNP) has listed a number of successes since the scheme was rolled out to empower the elderly and vulnerable members of society with cash.

The programmes include the Older Persons Cash Transfer (OPCT), the Cash Transfer for Orphans and Vulnerable Children (CT\u2013OVC) and the Persons with Severe Disability Cash Transfer (PWSD-CT) which are managed by the department of Social Protection, while the Ministry of Devolution also runs the Hunger Safety Net Programme (HSNP).", "articleBody": "The Kenya National Safety Net Programme (NSNP) has listed a number of successes since the scheme\nwas rolled out to empower the elderly and vulnerable members of society with cash.\n\nBefore introducing a national safety net program, Kenya was experiencing a high incidence of poverty around 46.6 % poverty rate. Poverty was also intertwined with higher inequality and vulnerability to shocks, the most significant of which was recurring droughts.\n\nCash transfer programs were fragmented and uncoordinated with different implementation arrangements leading to a variety of inefficiencies and duplication. The governance and fiduciary controls were also weak due to gaps in the quality of delivery systems across all programs.\n\nHowever, as the programme commonly referred as Inua Jamii anticipates universal coverage for some of its projects, the government must consider addressing challenges that hindered penetration and service delivery for more deserving persons.\n\nSo far, the project has reached more than a million citizens who receive cash from the programmes and\nthe number is expected to double once the government starts to automatically credit money bimonthly\nto citizens aged above 70 years.\n\nThe programmes include the Older Persons Cash Transfer (OPCT), the Cash Transfer for Orphans and\nVulnerable Children (CT\u2013OVC) and the Persons with Severe Disability Cash Transfer (PWSD-CT) which are managed by the department of Social Protection, while the Ministry of Devolution also runs the Hunger Safety Net Programme (HSNP).\n\nWhile the programmes have improved the living standards of the poor and vulnerable, they now face a\nnumber of systemic and operational challenges which must be tackled with urgency. First, the government needs to foster transparency in the identification and registration of beneficiaries. For instance, after expanding reach for OPCT, some unscrupulous State officials involved in the registration of the beneficiaries were accused of listing non deserving individuals. This must stop!\n\nThe government must also act on claims that some persons could be benefiting from more than one scheme, denying some deserving cases. The government must audit all the programmes and ensure only deserving cases benefit. It must then establish a foolproof system to identify and register beneficiaries based on official documentations with authentication from both government officials and the local community.\n\nA system that captures all the information including when the beneficiaries die or exit such programmes must be maintained. Hopefully, the effort by the government to harmonise and consolidate the schemes into a single registry under the social protection programme will weed out fraud. More importantly, the government must ensure information reaches the targeted population for registration since majority of the citizens are scattered in rural areas and urban slums where penetration might be difficult.\n\nFinally, the government should make it much easier for beneficiaries to access the cash by ensuring the financial institutions that remits the money have paying points as close as possible to beneficiaries.\n\nFrom A Human Perspective, Let Us Have A Reality Check In Sexual Offences Act\n\nby admin | Apr 22, 2021 | Features\n\nTweet\n\nLet us start from the premise of a popular saying that sex and money make the world go round. Really, one can hardly argue with that assertion, unless one is a eunuch or is totally sexually inhibited due to any other reason.\n\nSimply, sex sells, and it sells big time! In more licentious societies particularly in the West, sex is a multi-billion dollar industry accruing from the sale of related audio-visual materials and paraphernalia. Therefore, it is a high time we stopped the pretence and discussed this issue from a human perspective.\n\nThe issue of sexual offences came up recently during the ongoing interviews for the position of the Chief Justice (CJ) by the Judicial Service Commission when Justice Said Juma Chitembwe was put to task over his freeing of Martin Charo, 24, who had been sentenced to 20 years in prison for having sex with a 13-year-old girl. He said that the child appeared \u201cwilling to have sex with the defendant\u201d.\n\nI would hate to be in Justice Chitembwe\u2019s shoes. But it takes a man of valour like Chitembwe to stand up for reason even when he is bludgeoned by popular opinion. That is really, in my view, the mark of a CJ! Now, it is one thing for an adult to take advantage of a girl below the age of legal consent.\n\nThat should be punished severely. But what do you do when two \u2018consenting\u2019 minors are caught in the act? Do you jail both of them or, throw the male child under the bus while the acquiescent girl, sometimes the aggressor, goes scot-free? Truth be told, even those making some of these draconian and unrealistic laws against sexuality, were deflowered before the age of adulthood. Whether that was a good or bad thing is another matter best left to the moralists and individuals to grapple with.\n\nThe point is that the road to that first time is fraught with risky but sometimes unavoidable temptations. More often than not, it is consummated at the spur of the moment. I cannot put it any better than High Court Judge Luka Kimaru who recently addressed this matter comprehensively in a media con ference. While the judge duly noted that the Sexual Offences Act 2006 was progressive at the time of its enactment, it is important to review it now so as to make it compatible to current realities and dynamics.\n\nTeenage sex has increased tremendously and, by the look of things, will stay this way for some time. The days of abstention and scare of hell are long gone as social media glorifies sex in almost all platforms. During the days of my generation\u2019s adolescence, consensual sex between teenagers was also rife.\n\nThose who were found out were dealt with at the family level through punishment and counsel. Sadly, these days parents have apparently given up and left teenagers to their own devices. No one is advocating for men to be given a blank cheque to indulge their testosterone driven desires of their bodies. That is the prerogative of the caveman. However, we should always remain cognizant of the fact that nature dictates men will always make the first move in relationships.\n\nThe narrative that men cannot propose to a woman in a sexual context is very unfortunate and unrealistic. How will our young men get spouses if we legislate against sexual advances, which is predominantly a male pursuit?\n\nOf course, this has to happen within legal confines to avoid criminality, but inside the boundaries of common decency, culture and religion as well. It will be sad day when men are pushed to the wall, leaving them with no choice in pursuing their sexual attractions in order to avoid falling into legal pitfalls that criminalise their advances to women.\n\nHow President Uhuru Kenyatta Did It, To End Kenya\u2019s Dark Nights; The Last Mile Connectivity\n\nTweet\n\nA majority of Kenyans love the rural areas and have for years enjoyed its tranquility, the fresh environment free of noise but loathed one thing, having no access to electricity, no power to charge phones or even listen to the local radio that was at least reachable. This in most instances forced people to close business way earlier than usual as it was considered not safe to be outside when dark. Likewise, villages used to go completely dark even as early as 7 o\u2019clock with a long night awaited ahead. The nights were just too dark.\n\nFortunately, when President Uhuru Kenyatta came in to power back in 2013, there was a major turnaround in the Energy sector as far as access to electricity is concerned. The President understanding the situation Kenyans were faced with, channeled his energies on attaining universal access to electricity. Initially, only 4.5 million Kenyan households had access to electricity and was a figure way below what is considered optimum level. However, this took a major turnaround after President Uhuru Kenyatta came into power in 2013 as this figure has witnessed a more than 50% growth in the figures which has seen approxinmately 8 million Kenyan households have access to electricity.\n\nThis has brought great development in the rural towns and villages including increasing more hours of businesses, improved security through lighting of streets, students are able to do their studies at night and thereby improving themselves. This has greatly accelerated the growth of small businessess and been one of the enablers in the implementation of devolution when it comes to economic growth and development of counties.\n\nUnder the Last Mile Connectivity project, Kenya has had a 116 per cent jump in electricity connection with 4.89 million households having access to electricity from 2.26 million in March 2013 and growing to the aforementioned 8 million Kenyan households thus depicting steady growth in lighting up the country.\n\nMoreover, streets in our estates, feeder roads and informal settlements have had the areas lit up by street lights in what has enhanced security.\n\nBasically, there has been a progressive move in electricity connection especially throughout the country that many Kenyans can attest to. This among other areas has demonstrated President Kenyatta\u2019s commitment in improving key areas that facilitate growth in the country. As at 2018, 78% of Kenyans had access to electricity and the number has since gone up.\n\nParliament Has No Power To Alter Wanjiku\u2019s BBI Views\n\nby admin | Apr 20, 2021 | Features, Politics, Politics\n\nTweet\n\nA few days ago, the promoters of the Building Bridges Initiative (BBI) constitutional amendment bill announced the referendum would be in August.

Significant disruption in agricultural markets and labour in sub-Saharan Africa has restricted income and led to rapid food insecurity for many.\n\nEnsuring emergency financial support could reach people quickly became a priority for many governments, but with lockdowns and social distancing, traditional means of distributing relief were unavailable. Countries which had invested in making financial systems more inclusive mitigated the most severe economic shocks to households.\n\nThe ability of the countries to act wasn\u2019t built on radical reinvention, but rather on effective use of established solutions that drive digitisation, growth and inclusion. Of course, there is a limit to how much countries can expand financial access amid a crisis, so the time to upgrade financial policies and infrastructure to drive inclusion is now.\n\nAs African and global leaders look to implement plans following discussions at the World Bank and\nIMF Spring Meetings last week about steps countries can take to rebuild economies from the pandemic, they need not reinvent the wheel. Here are three suggestions for how countries can make economies more resilient to future shocks.\n\nFirst, countries should craft financial services regulations that provide space for companies and industry to innovate while safeguarding consumers against risks, including data privacy and cyber security. When countries get financial regulations right, the benefits of financial inclusion can accrue rapidly. Governments also need to increase ability to identify citizens and transact with them safely and quickly.\n\nInvesting in inclusive digital payment and identity infrastructure is the second step governments should take to rebuild financial systems and build more resilient economies. During the pandemic, countries\nwith high levels of payment and ID connectivity could quickly identify and deliver payments to households eligible for emergency funds.\n\nDigital payment and ID systems eliminated the need for people to complete paper forms or contend with crowded lines to receive emergency funds; they could apply online or by SMS and be paid digitally. By contrast, countries with limited payment connectivity and identity systems had less effective options.\n\nSome governments had to physically deliver cash, while others relied on social protection measures, such as subsidising the price of food or fuel. Fortunately, governments seeking to upgrade their digital financial systems need not start from scratch. They can make use of new, open-source payment and identity platforms built on best-in-class privacy, data protection and cyber security frameworks.\n\nThese innovations are accelerating digital financial inclusion in several countries. Ethiopia and Guinea are exploring pilots based on the MOSIP platform. A third step governments can take to build more resilient economies is to put women front and centre. A growing body of experimental evidence demonstrates that getting money into the hands of women to connect them to the formal financial system can lead to long-term benefits, including more decision making power in their household and greater economic security.\n\nThrough targeted emergency payment systems, enabled by strong, inclusive digital financial systems, governments have bolstered economic activity and supported women during the pandemic. An understanding of the outcomes of rapid response measures undertaken by governments to alleviate the economic impact of the pandemic will take time. It is clear, however, that over the last year, governments have preserved millions of lives and livelihoods through use of inclusive digital financial infrastructure.\n\nAs we emerge from the pandemic, governments have a chance to use lessons from the crisis to build the inclusive financial systems they will need to respond to future economic crises. By doing this, they can also position their economies for growth and resiliency in this digital century.", "articleBodyHtml": "<article>\n\n<figure><a href=\"https://www.reactorreview.com/?p=29044\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<img src=\"https://i2.wp.com/www.reactorreview.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/kenya-results.png?resize=780%2C439&amp;ssl=1\" alt=\"To Uplifting the Poor and Vulnerable, Let Us Do More To Improve Social Protection Service Delivery\">\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</a></figure>\n\n<p>The Kenya National Safety Net Programme (NSNP) has listed a number of successes since the scheme<br>\nwas rolled out to empower the elderly and vulnerable members of society with cash.</p>\n\n<p>Before introducing a national safety net program, Kenya was experiencing a high incidence of poverty around 46.6 % poverty rate. Poverty was also intertwined with higher inequality and vulnerability to shocks, the most significant of which was recurring droughts.</p>\n\n<p>Cash transfer programs were fragmented and uncoordinated with different implementation arrangements leading to a variety of inefficiencies and duplication. The governance and fiduciary controls were also weak due to gaps in the quality of delivery systems across all programs.</p>\n\n<p>However, as the programme commonly referred as Inua Jamii anticipates universal coverage for some of its projects, the government must consider addressing challenges that hindered penetration and service delivery for more deserving persons.</p>\n\n<p>So far, the project has reached more than a million citizens who receive cash from the programmes and<br>\nthe number is expected to double once the government starts to automatically credit money bimonthly<br>\nto citizens aged above 70 years.</p>\n\n<p>The programmes include the Older Persons Cash Transfer (OPCT), the Cash Transfer for Orphans and<br>\nVulnerable Children (CT\u2013OVC) and the Persons with Severe Disability Cash Transfer (PWSD-CT) which are managed by the department of Social Protection, while the Ministry of Devolution also runs the Hunger Safety Net Programme (HSNP).</p>\n\n<p>While the programmes have improved the living standards of the poor and vulnerable, they now face a<br>\nnumber of systemic and operational challenges which must be tackled with urgency. First, the government needs to foster transparency in the identification and registration of beneficiaries. For instance, after expanding reach for OPCT, some unscrupulous State officials involved in the registration of the beneficiaries were accused of listing non deserving individuals. This must stop!</p>\n\n<p>The government must also act on claims that some persons could be benefiting from more than one scheme, denying some deserving cases. The government must audit all the programmes and ensure only deserving cases benefit. It must then establish a foolproof system to identify and register beneficiaries based on official documentations with authentication from both government officials and the local community.</p>\n\n<p>A system that captures all the information including when the beneficiaries die or exit such programmes must be maintained. Hopefully, the effort by the government to harmonise and consolidate the schemes into a single registry under the social protection programme will weed out fraud. More importantly, the government must ensure information reaches the targeted population for registration since majority of the citizens are scattered in rural areas and urban slums where penetration might be difficult.</p>\n\n<p>Finally, the government should make it much easier for beneficiaries to access the cash by ensuring the financial institutions that remits the money have paying points as close as possible to beneficiaries.</p>\n\n<figure><a href=\"https://www.reactorreview.com/?p=29003\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<img src=\"https://i2.wp.com/www.reactorreview.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/IMG_20210422_084451.jpg?resize=582%2C415&amp;ssl=1\" alt=\"From A Human Perspective,  Let Us Have A Reality Check In Sexual Offences Act\">\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</a></figure>\n\n<h2><a href=\"https://www.reactorreview.com/?p=29003\">From A Human Perspective,  Let Us Have A Reality Check In Sexual Offences Act</a></h2>\n\n<p>by <a href=\"https://www.reactorreview.com/?author=1\" title=\"Posts by admin\">admin</a> | Apr 22, 2021 | <a href=\"https://www.reactorreview.com/?cat=20\">Features</a></p>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://twitter.com/intent/tweet?url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.reactorreview.com%2F%3Fp%3D29003&amp;via=FelixMu28970705\" data-size=\"large\">Tweet</a></p>\n\n<p>Let us start from the premise of a popular saying that sex and money make the world go round. Really, one can hardly argue with that assertion, unless one is a eunuch or is totally sexually inhibited due to any other reason.</p>\n\n<p>Simply, sex sells, and it sells big time! In more licentious societies particularly in the West, sex is a multi-billion dollar industry accruing from the sale of related audio-visual materials and paraphernalia. Therefore, it is a high time we stopped the pretence and discussed this issue from a human perspective.</p>\n\n<p>The issue of sexual offences came up recently during the ongoing interviews for the position of the Chief Justice (CJ) by the Judicial Service Commission when Justice Said Juma Chitembwe was put to task over his freeing of Martin Charo, 24, who had been sentenced to 20 years in prison for having sex with a 13-year-old girl. He said that the child appeared \u201cwilling to have sex with the defendant\u201d.</p>\n\n<p>I would hate to be in Justice Chitembwe\u2019s shoes. But it takes a man of valour like Chitembwe to stand up for reason even when he is bludgeoned by popular opinion. That is really, in my view, the mark of a CJ! Now, it is one thing for an adult to take advantage of a girl below the age of legal consent.</p>\n\n<p>That should be punished severely. But what do you do when two \u2018consenting\u2019 minors are caught in the act? Do you jail both of them or, throw the male child under the bus while the acquiescent girl, sometimes the aggressor, goes scot-free? Truth be told, even those making some of these draconian and unrealistic laws against sexuality, were deflowered before the age of adulthood. Whether that was a good or bad thing is another matter best left to the moralists and individuals to grapple with.</p>\n\n<p>The point is that the road to that first time is fraught with risky but sometimes unavoidable temptations. More often than not, it is consummated at the spur of the moment. I cannot put it any better than High Court Judge Luka Kimaru who recently addressed this matter comprehensively in a media con ference. While the judge duly noted that the Sexual Offences Act 2006 was progressive at the time of its enactment, it is important to review it now so as to make it compatible to current realities and dynamics.</p>\n\n<p>Teenage sex has increased tremendously and, by the look of things, will stay this way for some time. The days of abstention and scare of hell are long gone as social media glorifies sex in almost all platforms. During the days of my generation\u2019s adolescence, consensual sex between teenagers was also rife.</p>\n\n<p>Those who were found out were dealt with at the family level through punishment and counsel. Sadly, these days parents have apparently given up and left teenagers to their own devices. No one is advocating for men to be given a blank cheque to indulge their testosterone driven desires of their bodies. That is the prerogative of the caveman. However, we should always remain cognizant of the fact that nature dictates men will always make the first move in relationships.</p>\n\n<p>The narrative that men cannot propose to a woman in a sexual context is very unfortunate and unrealistic. How will our young men get spouses if we legislate against sexual advances, which is predominantly a male pursuit?</p>\n\n<p>Of course, this has to happen within legal confines to avoid criminality, but inside the boundaries of common decency, culture and religion as well. It will be sad day when men are pushed to the wall, leaving them with no choice in pursuing their sexual attractions in order to avoid falling into legal pitfalls that criminalise their advances to women.</p>\n\n<figure><a href=\"https://www.reactorreview.com/?p=28999\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<img src=\"https://i0.wp.com/www.reactorreview.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/IMG_20210422_064310.jpg?resize=1080%2C675&amp;ssl=1\" alt=\"How President Uhuru Kenyatta Did It, To End Kenya\u2019s Dark Nights; The Last Mile Connectivity\">\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</a></figure>\n\n<h2><a href=\"https://www.reactorreview.com/?p=28999\">How President Uhuru Kenyatta Did It, To End Kenya\u2019s Dark Nights; The Last Mile Connectivity</a></h2>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://twitter.com/intent/tweet?url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.reactorreview.com%2F%3Fp%3D28999&amp;via=FelixMu28970705\" data-size=\"large\">Tweet</a></p>\n\n<p>A majority of Kenyans love the rural areas and have for years enjoyed its tranquility, the fresh environment free of noise but loathed one thing, having no access to electricity, no power to charge phones or even listen to the local radio that was at least reachable. This in most instances forced people to close business way earlier than usual as it was considered not safe to be outside when dark. Likewise, villages used to go completely dark even as early as 7 o\u2019clock with a long night awaited ahead. The nights were just too dark.</p>\n\n<p>Fortunately, when President Uhuru Kenyatta came in to power back in 2013, there was a major turnaround in the Energy sector as far as access to electricity is concerned. The President understanding the situation Kenyans were faced with, channeled his energies on attaining universal access to electricity. Initially, only 4.5 million Kenyan households had access to electricity and was a figure way below what is considered optimum level. However, this took a major turnaround after President Uhuru Kenyatta came into power in 2013 as this figure has witnessed a more than 50% growth in the figures which has seen approxinmately 8 million Kenyan households have access to electricity.</p>\n\n<p>This has brought great development in the rural towns and villages including increasing more hours of businesses, improved security through lighting of streets, students are able to do their studies at night and thereby improving themselves. This has greatly accelerated the growth of small businessess and been one of the enablers in the implementation of devolution when it comes to economic growth and development of counties.</p>\n\n<p>Under the Last Mile Connectivity project, Kenya has had a 116 per cent jump in electricity connection with 4.89 million households having access to electricity from 2.26 million in March 2013 and growing to the aforementioned 8 million Kenyan households thus depicting steady growth in lighting up the country.</p>\n\n<p>Moreover, streets in our estates, feeder roads and informal settlements have had the areas lit up by street lights in what has enhanced security.</p>\n\n<p>Basically, there has been a progressive move in electricity connection especially throughout the country that many Kenyans can attest to. This among other areas has demonstrated President Kenyatta\u2019s commitment in improving key areas that facilitate growth in the country. As at 2018, 78% of Kenyans had access to electricity and the number has since gone up.</p>\n\n<figure><a href=\"https://www.reactorreview.com/?p=28943\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<img src=\"https://i2.wp.com/www.reactorreview.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/IMG_20210420_093439.jpg?resize=1080%2C675&amp;ssl=1\" alt=\"Parliament Has No Power To Alter Wanjiku\u2019s BBI Views\">\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</a></figure>\n\n<h2><a href=\"https://www.reactorreview.com/?p=28943\">Parliament Has No Power To Alter Wanjiku\u2019s BBI Views</a></h2>\n\n<p>by <a href=\"https://www.reactorreview.com/?author=1\" title=\"Posts by admin\">admin</a> | Apr 20, 2021 | <a href=\"https://www.reactorreview.com/?cat=20\">Features</a>, <a href=\"https://www.reactorreview.com/?cat=10\">Politics</a>, <a href=\"https://www.reactorreview.com/?cat=101\">Politics</a></p>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://twitter.com/intent/tweet?url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.reactorreview.com%2F%3Fp%3D28943&amp;via=FelixMu28970705\" data-size=\"large\">Tweet</a></p>\n\n<p>A few days ago, the promoters of the Building Bridges Initiative (BBI) constitutional amendment bill announced the referendum would be in August. This is after it dawned on them the initial June date was no longer realistic.</p>\n\n<p>They cited the delay by the Nation al Assembly and the Senate to pass the bill. And now some of the BBI bill promoters are pushing for reopening of the report, a move that will definitely derail the process further. The BBI bill had earlier been tabled before county assemblies and received overwhelming support. The assemblies complied with Article 257 of the Constitution which outlines a<br>\nroadmap of amending the Constitution through the popular initiative.</p>\n\n<p>Under this law, the hands of the legislative bodies, both at county and national levels are tied. They have no power to alter or add a coma or fullstop to a bill that originates from views of the people. The county assemblies had two options: to either adopt or reject the bill submitted to them by the Independent Electoral and Boundaries Commission.</p>\n\n<p>The National Assembly and the Senate had a similar role. However, even if the two Houses rejected the original BBI bill, it wouldn\u2019t stop the IEBC from going ahead with referendum plans. Kenyans will have the final say.</p>\n\n<p>President Uhuru Kenyatta and his Handshake partner Raila Odinga are the key drivers of the BBI process. However, going by latest political events, it seems one or both of them has/have changed mind. They no longer lead the BBI process with same vigour and energy they exhibited at the start of the journey.</p>\n\n<p>Besides their allies are now rooting for the reopening of bill and if they have eventually have their way, then the BBI bill would no longer be a popular document. Well, one of the key proposals that the MPs, who are pushing for the reopening of BBI report, are uncomfortable with is that of increasing the number of constituencies. Central Kenya is highly populated and hence it is set to receive the lion\u2019s share of the 70 additional parliamentary seats.</p>\n\n<p>The BBI bill has no clause suggesting the power to create new electoral units would be taken away from IEBC. Once adopted, the commission will still exercise this power. In the event that the document is reopened, we would result in two documents, one passed by county assemblies and the amended version endorsed by two Houses of Parliament.</p>\n\n<p>So which bill will be presented to Kenyans at the referendum? Further, this would give the anti BBI team more grounds to challenge the legality of the process in court. One wonders why the same proponents of the constitution amendment initiative would want to offend the same supreme law of the land they seek to make better.</p>\n\n<p>Remember how Raila allies repeatedly countered the narrative of cost of a referendum, arguing that Kenyans stand to gain more if BBI sailed through? What has changed? Kenyans deserve better leadership, please!</p>\n\n<figure><a href=\"https://www.reactorreview.com/?p=28899\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<img src=\"https://i2.wp.com/www.reactorreview.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/IMG_20210419_103041.jpg?resize=713%2C562&amp;ssl=1\" alt=\"An Event of Bedside Comfort, Popularity and Money Is Nothing Near A Revolution\">\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</a></figure>\n\n<h2><a href=\"https://www.reactorreview.com/?p=28899\">An Event of Bedside Comfort, Popularity and Money Is Nothing Near A Revolution</a></h2>\n\n<p>by <a href=\"https://www.reactorreview.com/?author=1\" title=\"Posts by admin\">admin</a> | Apr 19, 2021 | <a href=\"https://www.reactorreview.com/?cat=20\">Features</a>, <a href=\"https://www.reactorreview.com/?cat=9\">Opinion</a>, <a href=\"https://www.reactorreview.com/?cat=10\">Politics</a></p>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://twitter.com/intent/tweet?url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.reactorreview.com%2F%3Fp%3D28899&amp;via=FelixMu28970705\" data-size=\"large\">Tweet</a></p>\n\n<p>A warm cozy, room, with a hot cup of coffee or tea.

And as things go, there may be a small window left to rescue both his career and the destiny of Somalia.\n\nOn Tuesday, the latest ominous sign came from a grouping of Hawiye clan members and professionals. Gathering in Mogadishu, they withdrew support for Farmaajo, expressing fury at his decisions to assent to the term extension motion of parliament.\n\nA voice emerged from 400 delegates of Mogadishu\u2019s most prominent clan with interests in politics and businesses which means they have sufficient influence in the capital. The participants include two ex-Presidents, a former PM, opposition and youth leaders as well as other special interest groups.\n\nWell, some have argued perhaps correctly that the clan as a unit of politics in Somalia may be behind the perennial chaos.\n\nBut Somalia\u2019s nascent democracy borrows from its culture and history, which means that every son and daughter the clans have brought up to serve their country considers their class as the basic politics. It is the way Somalis have organized themselves for centuries and it is why we cannot throw away the bathwater with the baby.\n\nThis is why the clan, no matter its shortcomings in other times, will remain influential in Somali politics and any leader who ignores it perishes politically. For the Hawiye specifically, their influence in Mogadishu means that any changes in the political stability of the country affect them directly and their influence in Mogadishu means that ay changes in the political stability of the country affect them directly and their displeasure simply means one bigger door has been slammed in Farmaajo\u2019s face.\n\nThere have been other protestants more directly from Farmaajo\u2019s rival in the presidential contest. This week the National Salvation Forum warned of political instability as the term extension goes on. And Presidents of Galmudung, Hirshabelle And South West have recently come under pressure from their own clans to clarify their positions. The donors and partners have all rejected the extensions and warned of a reevaluation of the relationship, including suspension of crucial programs in security and humanitarian sectors.\n\nYet even in the glare of these warnings, President Farmaajo has chosen to go on a charm offensive seeking the African Union\u2019s hand to endorse his ill-thought and controversial term extension.\n\nHe did not read between the lines when after meeting President Felix Tshisekedi of the Democratic Republic of Congo, he was told that Somalia must pursue its own consensus to avert a crisis. Mr. Tshisekedi the current chairman of the African Union agreed to support dialogue in Somalia an indication that the continental body is willing to step in.\n\nBut everybody knows Farmaajo\u2019s game plan is to get an endorsement from the AU to sanitize his political dirt. Earning from his friends in Ethiopia, Farmaajo knows he can seek the involvement of the African Union because the body itself is flawed in operation: all leaders have hidden behind Article 4(g) of the AU Constitutive Act on \u201cnon-interference in internal matters\u201d of members.\n\nIn short, he can reduce the continental body into spectators just as the neighbors did with the Tigray region.\n\nThis is not to say the AU is a useless organization. In fact, Somalia has a lot to thank the AU for having created the AU Mission in Somalia which has been guarding Farmaajo and his palace, the Villa Somalia.\n\nWe fear that Farmaajo has shown sufficient hypocrisy in the past. On one day he insists on sovereignty when critics pour in while on the other hand when he is facing local turmoil he rushes to the AU for help.\n\nThe flip-flopping is meant to waste time and the best thing Farmaajo can do is to resume talks which will be the surest way to ending this fiasco.\n\nMiscalculations that cost DP Ruto special place at Uhuru\u2019s side\n\nby admin | Apr 21, 2021 | Opinion\n\nPolitical observers who had predicted that Uhuru Kenyatta would by now be a lame-duck president operating in the shadows of his ambitious deputy William Ruto may have been forced to reassess their prediction by the recent turn of events.\n\nNever before in Kenya\u2019s independence history has a vice-president wielded more power than Ruto did during Jubilee Party\u2019s first term in office from 2013 to 2017.\n\nWith a constant presence by President Uhuru\u2019s side during that period, Ruto had a free hand in running ministries and was deeply involved in drawing up government programs and even supervising some.\n\nPolitical commentators, and some senior government officials, quietly referred to him as the power behind the throne, or even a co-president.\n\nJaramogi Oginga Odinga, 1963-1966\n\nOut of his 10 predecessors, no other vice-president, perhaps with the exception of Jaramogi Oginga Odinga, had the moral authority to exercise the kind of unrestrained power as Ruto did.\n\nJaramogi\u2019s moral authority emanated from the widely documented gesture of turning down the colonial government\u2019s offer to become Kenya\u2019s first prime minister in favor of Jomo Kenyatta, whom he felt was more deserving. Kenyatta was then in prison.\n\nRuto\u2019s moral authority came from the fact that he had sacrificed his presidential ambition in 2013 in favor of Uhuru.\n\nIn doing so, Ruto and his United Republican Party (URP) went into an equal partnership with Uhuru\u2019s The National Alliance (TNA) and defeated their main challenger Raila Odinga, who was vying under the Coalition for Reforms and Democracy (Cord) banner.\n\n2010 Constitution\n\nThe 2013 pre-election partnership agreement between URP and TNA gave Ruto control of half of the government posts, among them Cabinet secretaries, principal secretaries, ambassadors and state parastatals.\n\nJoseph Murumbi, 1966-1967\n\nAnd in the first term of the Jubilee administration, this is where Ruto\u2019s powers lay. However, many people misjudged these powers to emanate from his office as deputy president.\n\nThe 2010 Constitution made cosmetic changes to the Office of the deputy president \u2014 changing the name from vice-president and making it difficult for the president to fire his deputy on a whim.\n\nHowever, the deputy president\u2019s constitutional powers remained marginal, meaning the authority that Ruto exercised in Jubilee\u2019s first term was largely delegated to him by his boss.\n\nThe personal bond between the \u201cdynamic duo\u201d, as they were referred to by the media, had been strengthened by the criminal charges they were both facing at the International Criminal Court (ICC) arising from the 2007/2008 post-election violence.\n\nBut even during this time, a number of observers in Uhuru\u2019s inner circle had quietly voiced misgivings about the DP appearing to overreach himself.\n\nDaniel arap Moi. 1967-1978\n\nOne misgiving they pointed out early was the manner in which Ruto tended to hog the limelight during presidential functions, often speaking inordinately long while enumerating government projects and policies, and leaving his boss with little to say.\n\nMurathe warning\n\nIt is possible the President was not too pleased by his deputy\u2019s conduct but decided to play along for purposes of political expediency, mainly his 2017 re-election.\n\nOn hindsight, a hint of Uhuru\u2019s displeasure came from Jubilee Party vice-chairman David Murathe, who just before the August 7, 2017, General Election, told a local TV station that Uhuru would be more assertive in his second term.\n\n\u201cI am very sorry for people if Uhuru gets re-elected,\u201d Murathe told KTN, \u201cBecause his agenda will be his legacy issues which will be anchored in law, order, discipline and the fight against corruption.\u201d\n\nMwai Kibaki. 1978-1988\n\nAt the time, many thought the words were directed at opposition leaders, mainly Raila, who, just like in 2013, was Uhuru\u2019s main challenger in the 2017 election.\n\nLooking at it now, this statement perhaps signalled President Uhuru\u2019s intention to take back the powers he had donated to his deputy in his first term.\n\nThe President\u2019s first move was to name his a new Cabinet alone at State House after what appeared to have been a tussle with his deputy over names of new Cabinet Secretaries.\n\nRuto kept away from the function, unlike in 2013 when the newly-elected leaders, clad in matching white shirts and red ties, named the Cabinet at State House.\n\nThe President\u2019s second move was the March 2018 Handshake with Raila, an event that is said to have caught the DP unawares and which has since bitterly divided the Jubilee Party.\n\nThe President then followed with a call that Jubilee leaders should cease premature political campaigns which had been stirred by the Handshake.\n\nJosephat Karanja, 1988-1989\n\nHis call was largely seen as aimed at the DP whom Uhuru derided for \u201ctanga tanga\u201d (wandering aimlessly) all over the country.\n\nChurch fundraisers\n\nEither by design or default, this statement seemed to have provided the cue to Cabinet Secretaries, Principal Secretaries and heads of parastatals to give a wide berth to the DP\u2019s countrywide tours in the name of launching government projects.\n\nWhen this line was cut off, Ruto converted his \u201cdevelopment tours\u201d to church fundraisers which allowed him to travel around the country and sell his agenda, without seeking the blessings of his boss.\n\nAt the same time, his lieutenants in Parliament upped their raw criticism of the President and the Building Bridges Initiative (BBI) which Uhuru launched with Raila as a follow up to the Handshake.\n\nGeorge Saitoti. 1989-2002\n\nAt the same time, the DP and his foot soldiers in Parliament openly ciriticised what they termed as President Uhuru\u2019s partisan war on corruption which they claimed was targeting Ruto and his allies.\n\nConsequently, it forced the DP and his lieutenants take positions on the war on graft that were sometimes not only at variance with Uhuru\u2019s stand, but also public opinion.\n\nThe DP even took it upon himself to criticize public institutions involved in the fight against the vice, thus raising questions about his allegiance.\n\nMusalia Mudavadi, 2002-2002\n\nHe memorably differed with the Director of Criminal Investigations George Kinoti, over the amount of money lost in the Arror and Kimwarer dam scandals, arguing that the DCI was being used to settle political scores.\n\nCorruption war\n\nIn the impeachment of Kiambu Governor Ferdinand Waititu and the prosecution of Nairobi Governor Mike Sonko, the DP\u2019s lieutenants rushed to their defence and even appeared for them in court.\n\nMany saw this as a bold attempt by the DP and his allies to undermine the President on the war on corruption, a fact that some of the DP\u2019s allies loudly proclaimed in public forums.\n\nWith an eye on the 2022 presidential race, in 2016, Ruto engineered the merger of URP, TNA and other smaller parties to the Jubilee Party, despite disquiet from his Kalenjin political base.\n\nKijana Wamalwa. 2003- 2003\n\nThe thinking at the time was that it would be easier to sell Ruto\u2019s presidential candidature in Mt Kenya through a single unified party rather than through Jubilee\u2019s former affiliates.\n\nBut given the happenings in the Jubilee Party, this is a decision that the DP must be regretting. The TNA-URP merger effectively ended the 2013 pre-election pact between Uhuru and Ruto which had given the latter half of the government where he drew his real power over the first five years. With the merger, the DP had surrendered the strongest leverage he had over the President.\n\nPresident Kenyatta, who is also the Jubilee Party leader, has deployed key his lieutenants within the party to carry out the recent coup against the DP\u2019s allies in the Senate.\n\nMoody Awori. 2003-2008\n\nUnder the President\u2019s instructions, Jubilee replaced Elgeyo Marakwet Senator Kipchumba Murkomen as Majority Leader and his Nakuru counterpart Susan Kihika as Chief Whip. Both are staunch DP supporters.\n\nA close reading of history reveals an interesting fact that the only thing Kenya\u2019s 11th and first vice-presidents share: the manner in which they were cut down to size by the very men they helped to rise to power.\n\nJaramogi\u2019s resignation\n\nIn the three years that Jaramogi served as Mzee Kenyatta\u2019s principal assistant, their friendship had deteriorated so much over differences touching on a myriad of issues.\n\nKalonzo Musyoka. 2008-2013\n\nKenyatta responded by whittling down Jaramogi\u2019s influence in government, the culmination of which was demoting him to vice president without portfolio, after stripping him of his Home Affairs docket which he handed over to Daniel arap Moi.\n\nBasically, Jaramogi had a big office without any powers.\n\nWorse was to come when Kenyatta, through Jaramogi\u2019s main competitor in Cabinet and rival in Luo Nyanza politics, Tom Mboya, executed a coup within the ruling Kanu party which saw Jaramogi and his lieutenants purged out of influential positions in Kanu.\n\nUnable to take the humiliation any more, on April 4, 1966, Jaramogi took the high road and wrote this letter to his former ally-turned-foe:\n\nInternational Community Must Reject Mogadishu Power Grab\n\nby admin | Apr 20, 2021 | Opinion\n\nSomali President Mohamed Abdullahi Mohamed, alias Farmajo, has extended his stay in office for a further two years. His term ended on February 8, after four years, and elections for a new president were supposed to have been held.\n\nFarmajo used the deadlock over the mode of voting between the federal government and the federal states as the excuse to extend his term. His government and the governments of several of the federal states are unable to agree whether to continue with the delegate system used previously, or introduce universal suffrage of one-person one-vote.\n\nFarmaajo has dug himself into a cul-de-sac, and there will be consequences. To begin with, the two-year period will not resolve the problem. The relations between the federal and state governments will only deteriorate further because of this impasse. There are five states, Jubbaland, Puntland, South-West, Galmudug, and Hir-Shabelle some of whom have rejected universal suffrage.\n\nThose that want the delegates system even want it reformed to be more democratic and transparent, something the Farmajo government has rejected. The federal government has zero capacity to force the states rejecting universal suffrage to participate in an election they don\u2019t want. Farmajo is facing an even more daunting challenge. His key international backers, principally the US and Britain, have rejected the extension of his term.\n\nUnfortunately, despite mumblings by some Somalis this is interference in the country\u2019s internal affairs, a government that fully relies on the goodwill of the international community for its very existence, needs to be more humble. Without these backers, the federal government would be overrun by Al Shabaab within days.\n\nThe way out for Farmaajo is talks, but he will have to recuse himself from running for another term to give comfort to those who think he is trying to put in place a system that favours his re-election prospects. He should have put in place a care taker government of national unity to reach a consensus, and organise polls during this extension period.\n\nWorse for the Somali federal government, increasing challenges are compounding its problems. A resurgent Al Shabaab has intensified its bombing campaign in the capital Mogadishu in recent months, obviously taking advantage of an increasingly distracted government, and rising political tensions in the country. Somalia is in the midst of a second wave of the Covid, which has proved more deadly than the first wave.\n\nInfections and deaths have shot up, at a time when the poorly equipped and poorly resourced healthcare system is pushed to the limit. The chickens of Kenya finally putting its foot down over the closure of the Daadab refugee camps, are coming home to roost. Kenya has demanded that the international community put together a time bound plan to repatriate home all the 200,000 Somali refugees, and has given deadlines. Settling the refugees in Somalia will stretch the resources and logistics of the Somali government to the limit.\n\nAnd right now, its key priority is survival. The African Union has been very quiet over these developments. Normally quick off the mark to condemn military power grabs, it has refused to object as government after government has violated its country\u2019s constitution for political purposes.\n\nUnfortunately, Kenya cannot escape fallout from the ensuing Somali crisis. Kenya has been the focus of Farmaajo\u2019s attempts at deflecting attention from his internal problems through hysterical pronouncements that Kenya is interfering with its internal affairs. Despite Kenya denying any such interference, the fact is that Kenya cannot sit back and let Somalia mess itself up, as it is always the country that bears the brunt of the resultant chaos.\n\nFarmajo\u2019s power grab by tampering with constitutional term limits needs to be seen against the broader context of the continent where presidents are now routinely over throwing constitutional term limits to allow them to run, and win, third terms.\n\nThis has drastically rolled back the democratic gains Africa made in the early years of this century, and it has been directly responsible for most of the violence and political tension that is now engulfing the continent.\n\nThis man Fred Ngatia; From the Bar straight to the head of the Judiciary\n\nby admin | Apr 20, 2021 | Opinion\n\nIf Fredrick Ngatia were to be nominated by the Judicial Service Commission for appointment as Kenya\u2019s Chief Justice, he would have made a rare leap that is from the Bar straight to the head of the Judiciary.\n\nOnly Maluki Kitili Mwendwa, Bernard Chunga and Willy Mutunga have become CJ without having held any judicial office before.\n\nHowever, this is not a bet he cannot pull off that feat. Mr Ngatia is the senior-most of the 10 CJ candidates.\n\nFor a profession obsessed with, if not slavish about seniority, Mr Ngatia\u2019s four decades as an advocate will count on account of longevity and the title conferred to him as Senior Counsel last year.\n\nThe apogee of his law practice is the pro bono case former Chief Justice Willy Mutunga handed him when he requested Ngatia to represent death row suspects. His success in the Francis Kariokoo Muruatetu case at the Supreme Court, where it was declared unconstitutional to impose a mandatory death sentence on convicts, is what he considers his finest piece of work. Some 5,000 prisoners have since gone back to the High Court for resentencing.\n\nBeyond his 40 years\u2019 experience in the practice of law, Ngatia will be brandishing his freshly minted masters in applied philosophy to prove that a CJ needs a multidisciplinary approach. He researched euthanasia, which is prohibited in Kenya, and his research found that where it is administered, the moral questions it raises demonstrate that apex courts deal with questions of bioethics, theology, the transcendental nature of man.\n\nLast year, Ngatia joined the hallowed ranks of Senior Counsel, and he will be battling the optics of ethnic balancing in joining a Supreme Court where another member of his Kikuyu community is also a long-serving member.\n\nThe holder of Bachelors and Masters of Laws degrees from the University of Nairobi and the London School of Economics respectively, Mr Ngatia seeks a return to public service, having started his practice as State counsel in the office of the Attorney-General.\n\nMr Ngatia then ventured into private practice where he has ploughed his trade in a firm that carries his name as principal.\n\nThough this company may be deemed small, if not solo practice, its clientele would speak to a heavy hitting litigation practice. Chambers & Partners, an international firm that classifies lawyers, recognized Mr Ngatia as one of Kenya\u2019s best litigators in 2019.\n\nNgatia\u2019s long client list includes Kamlesh Pattni when he faced a murder charge, Justice Philip Tunoi when he faced a tribunal investigating his misconduct, Judges Philomena Mwilu, Mohammed Ibrahim and Abida Ali-Aroni at the Judges and Magistrates Vetting Board, and the late Vice President George Saitoti when he challenged his prosecution over the KSh158 billion Goldenberg scandal. Ngatia also filed a complaint against Judge Joseph Mutava at the tribunal investigating him, calling him a serial liar.\n\nThe judge was removed from office. Ngatia shot to fame with his representation of Uhuru Kenyatta in the 2017 presidential election petitions. As soon as the 1 September 2017 nullification decision came in, Ngatia began preparing for the next petition \u2013 which followed in November after the fresh election. He has managed a frenetic 14-day petition, and believes the same leadership principles would enable him to lead the institution. Yet, Ngatia does not consider the presidential petitions as his greatest achievement.\n\nContentious petitions\n\nIf an advocate can be defined by the work he does and his clients, then there is a lot to be said of Mr. Ngatia as a legal practitioner.\n\nEven that would be a partial and incomplete description of the breadth of Mr Ngatia\u2019s practice. Known mostly as one of the legal counsel to President Uhuru Kenyatta in the contentious petitions challenging the 2013 and 2017 elections, Mr. Ngatia is thought to be a system\u2019s advocate, if such a job exists.\n\nThe choice of Mr. Ngatia as counsel for the high and mighty preceded the election cases.\n\nIn 2006, Prof George Saitoti, while a minister, sought Mr Ngatia\u2019s representation in a case challenging the findings made by the Judicial Commission on the Goldenberg Affair as to the minister\u2019s involvement in the scandal.\n\nThe court not only quashed the findings and recommendations of the Commission of Inquiry for prosecution of Mr. Ngatia\u2019s client but also thanked him and his co-counsel for the quality of their research and advocacy in the proceedings. Prof Saitoti has since died.\n\nEven members of the Judiciary have found themselves in need of his counsel. Justice Philip Tunoi of the Supreme Court sought Mr Ngatia\u2019s representation when the judge faced a tribunal inquiring into whether he needed to be dismissed for gross misconduct.\n\nWhile his practice is more on the corporate and commercial litigation, Mr Ngatia made a mark in the criminal bar in a case that will have a long lasting effect on the justice system in Kenya.\n\nMandatory death sentences\n\nHis representation of Mr Francis Muruatetu in the Supreme Court in 2017 changed the law in a refreshing way that points to his legal mind to give the Constitution its full tenor and effect in the lives of ordinary citizens.\n\nMr Ngatia\u2019s client had challenged the Penal Code\u2019s prescription of a mandatory death sentences for a person convicted of murder. On the strength of the advocacy, the Supreme Court agreed with Mr Ngatia that mandatory capital punishment was unconstitutional.\n\nThe court said a mandatory sentence is an unreasonable restraint on a judicial officer because it deprives the judges of the discretion to consider mitigating factors in sentencing and makes the process of mitigation an unnecessary gesture during trial.\n\nWith this decision, many convicts on death row got a reprieve by challenging the courts to reconsider their sentences. An indirect public benefit was served by Mr Ngatia\u2019s advocacy in this case.\n\nThe truth, though, is that some may be anxious about the possibility of Mr Ngatia as Chief Justice for the reason that his clientele indicates an advocate for the high and mighty with little time for the ordinary litigant.\n\nThe Muruatetu case may be an answer to them as to how he perceives the constitutional liberties and rights of the common citizen. Additionally, it ears mentioning that an advocate by his professional obligation takes whichever client he finds himself with.\n\nAdvocacy does not necessarily infer alliance with or affinity to the client\u2019s position.\n\nFormidable litigator\n\nAs an advocate, Mr Ngatia is a formidable litigator described by many as polite and soft-spoken without being a pushover. It would be a mission of high guesswork to try and define the kind of judge, leave alone the kind of CJ, any person would make on appointment.\n\nIn a presumed Justice Fred Ngatia, that would be even harder for three reasons. One is that he has never been a judge. This would only be for those who believe and act on the divisive binary of the Judiciary having insiders and outsiders.\n\nSecondly, it is never possible to define for a candidate what taking a judicial posting would mean for his or her personal jurisprudence.\n\nThirdly, and more importantly, the obsession with personal jurisprudence sometimes is but a harbinger by which a candidate for judicial office is defined by an ideological lens, which he may not even have given thought to.\n\nIt is never a given that a judge will decide cases in a guaranteed way , even to the administration responsible for his appointment. Those unwilling to believe this may take cue from Dwight Eisenhower who after naming Earl Warren as Chief Justice said the appointment was the worst decision of his presidency.\n\nWarren, a Republican on his appointment, led the Supreme Court into a set of civil rights decisions, which transformed the United States in a way that did not please the president and his Republican party.\n\nIf Mr Ngatia were to be appointed Chief Justice, we can only guess the level of transformation he would make. No one knows for sure. The same would apply largely for all the other candidates to the office of CJ.\n\nHowever, there is no denying that Mr Ngatia has the tools for the job in terms of qualifications.\n\nAn Event of Bedside Comfort, Popularity and Money Is Nothing Near A Revolution\n\nTweet\n\nA warm cozy, room, with a hot cup of coffee or tea. Socks on and a stack of pillows near the work area. It may be done on the bed, the seat, the living room whichever place that evokes comfort, for comfort is key. Any sight of blood or sweat is despicable and unimaginable to them. For they don\u2019t like to tire and move about. They don\u2019t like to move about and the thought of just being around people is an irritant to their body especially their years. These are the individuals who claim they are revolutionists\n\nBack in the day until now a revolution was considered a sacrificial undertaking where humanity came out in voice and in deed to defend their cause, to fight for what they know is best, they made placards, spoke and urged and convinced people to join them in the streets and support their causes. Great revolutionists were ready to sacrifice their lives, were ready to fight and indeed fought, were ready to be arrested even if it meant going it alone. From the likes of Che Guevera a major figure in the Cuba Revolution, to Martin Luther King who fought against racism in America revolutions were not a zone of comfort but moments of sacrifice, retaliation and retribution.\n\nIt demanded some sense of collegiality as they deemed unity in their work critical till they attain their cause and this was often reflected in the masses gathered and the progressive attainment of their goals. Even at our current moment in time we have seen the Arab Spring that has entangled countries of the Middle East and Northern Africa which has seen war and suffering as they spoke out and demanded change.\n\nWhat would have happened if they sat back on their dear beds with phones and laptops to start tweeting and commenting on anything and everything they see go through social media. Pretty much nothing. This is the situation of people in Kenya who claim they are revolutionists in the comfort of their bedsitters, in the comfort of their warm and cozy homes who spend the better part of their day and night looking for quotable quotes and tweetable tweets. The revolutionists who cannot even raise their voice on anything. They label themselves as fighters through cartoon characters of past revolutionists on their profile pictures but cannot even stand the raging sun outside, cannot gather masses and most of all, find it down right ridiculous to carry placards, screaming and shouting to capture the attention of those they want. The farthest they can do is air their views and noise through paragraphs on social media sites away from the heat, the noise and especially away from the face of the police.\n\nTheir revolution is an open fallacy to gain clout and popularity and start making money online through following because at the end of the day they are only engaging in a selfish undertaking. There is no revolution here but a money making venture, no more no less.\n\nA DEPUTY PRESIDENT ACTING ANGRY AND SULKING IS A SAD MOMENT FOR KENYA\n\nby admin | Apr 17, 2021 | Opinion\n\n\u201cGiven the opportunity to be President, I would not allow my Deputy President to be humiliated the way I have been humiliated\u201d ~ Dr. William Samoei Ruto.\n\nMany KENYANS may have missed an important show as they were busy analyzing KCPE results. Allow us to REVISIT the interview.\n\nOn citizen Tv, a very shocking interview took place. The deputy PRESIDENT William Ruto was lamenting. His lamentations were candid.\n\nHe clearly lamented on his disappointment on how his boss UHURU KENYATTA has worked with him/handled him. He said UHURU had humiliated him.\n\n\u201cGiven the opportunity to be President, I would not allow my Deputy President to be humiliated the way I have been humiliated\u201d ~\n\nWe thought that DP knows that politicians in Kenya practice political polygamy. So, for him to start sulking so late in the day that there are other partners in his marriage with Uhuru is hypocritical. His entire career has been about cross-breeding from Kanu to ODM, to URP to Jubilee, etc. So what\u2019s pinching his big toe now?\n\nThe DP acted victim during the interview, blaming everyone and everything for his problems with his boss. He forgot his words of \u201cIn 6 months\u2019 time the Stadium in Wote will be complete, in another 6 months\u2019 time Kamariny Stadium will be complete!\u201d\n\nHe said and I quote..\n\n\u201cI asked the president to produce information showing what I had done in private and in public to disrespect him or to elevated myself beyond what my duties are and the president was very candid with me, he told me there is no such information. The director of intelligence was there and he also did not produce any information on the same,\u201d he added.\n\nBwana Ruto Do you need the DCI to remind you that In 2013, a court found you guilty of grabbing 100 acres piece of land belonging to one Adrian Muteshi. You were ordered to return the land and also pay Muteshi ksh5m for trespassing on his land? Is this not info to show wrongdoing on your part?\n\nDp Ruto then went ahead and blamed the drunkenness of Jubilee leaders for failed promises. He said and I quote\u2026\n\n\u201cI have tried all I could to see if we could work all this out in Jubilee\u2026Unfortunately, those who call the shots are hardly sober. They appear on national TV drunk\u2026That is the level of impunity\u201d\n\nThe question that begs is, DP, If your character & integrity is unquestionable, you are an angel, but the rest in your Jubilee company are drunkards, why don\u2019t you RESIGN from the system? Bible says bad company ruins good morals. Quit that bad company called Jubilee! History will judge you harshly if you tag along that bandwagon of drunkards.\n\nTo crown his interview, Ruto boasted.\n\n\u201cIf Raila Odinga will not be my opponent then who will be?\u201d.\n\nThe problem with Ruto is pride and overconfidence. The way he looks down on other leaders makes me sick. He forgets what Papa Atwoli told us. Uhuru is too young to retire.\n\nDP is simply saying, that Uhuru, Musalia Mudavadi, Kalonzo, Weta, and Gideon Moi are nothing. To him, the only person that can compete with him is Raila.\n\nHe probably sponsored the interview to show Kenyans he is the victim while Kenyans already know his past. And come 2022 he will be judged by his past. He killed 1000s of Kikuyus in Rift Valley for power and the powerful Mt Kenya region has judged him already and found him lacking.", "articleBodyHtml": "<article>\n\n<figure><a href=\"https://www.reactorreview.com/?p=28995\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<img src=\"https://i2.wp.com/www.reactorreview.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/Farmajo-Qatar-Congo-DR.jpg?resize=928%2C625&amp;ssl=1\" alt=\"Somalia President Farmaajo\u2019s self-cleansing drive will be his waterloo\">\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</a></figure>\n\n<p>by  |  | <a href=\"https://www.reactorreview.com/?cat=9\">Opinion</a></p>\n\n<p>Somalia\u2019s Mohamed Farmaajo, whose term expired on February 8, continues to ignore the writings on the wall. And as things go, there may be a small window left to rescue both his career and the destiny of Somalia.</p>\n\n<p>On Tuesday, the latest ominous sign came from a grouping of Hawiye clan members and professionals. Gathering in Mogadishu, they withdrew support for Farmaajo, expressing fury at his decisions to assent to the term extension motion of parliament.</p>\n\n<p>A voice emerged from 400 delegates of Mogadishu\u2019s most prominent clan with interests in politics and businesses which means they have sufficient influence in the capital. The participants include two ex-Presidents, a former PM, opposition and youth leaders as well as other special interest groups.</p>\n\n<p>Well, some have argued perhaps correctly that the clan as a unit of politics in Somalia may be behind the perennial chaos.</p>\n\n<p>But Somalia\u2019s nascent democracy borrows from its culture and history, which means that every son and daughter the clans have brought up to serve their country considers their class as the basic politics. It is the way Somalis have organized themselves for centuries and it is why we cannot throw away the bathwater with the baby.</p>\n\n<p>This is why the clan, no matter its shortcomings in other times, will remain influential in Somali politics and any leader who ignores it perishes politically. For the Hawiye specifically, their influence in Mogadishu means that any changes in the political stability of the country affect them directly and their influence in Mogadishu means that ay changes in the political stability of the country affect them directly and their displeasure simply means one bigger door has been slammed in Farmaajo\u2019s face.</p>\n\n<p>There have been other protestants more directly from Farmaajo\u2019s rival in the presidential contest. This week the National Salvation Forum warned of political instability as the term extension goes on. And Presidents of Galmudung, Hirshabelle And South West have recently come under pressure from their own clans to clarify their positions. The donors and partners have all rejected the extensions and warned of a reevaluation of the relationship, including suspension of crucial programs in security and humanitarian sectors.</p>\n\n<p>Yet even in the glare of these warnings, President Farmaajo has chosen to go on a charm offensive seeking the African Union\u2019s hand to endorse his ill-thought and controversial term extension.</p>\n\n<p>He did not read between the lines when after meeting President Felix Tshisekedi of the Democratic Republic of Congo, he was told that Somalia must pursue its own consensus to avert a crisis. Mr. Tshisekedi the current chairman of the African Union agreed to support dialogue in Somalia an indication that the continental body is willing to step in.</p>\n\n<p>But everybody knows Farmaajo\u2019s game plan is to get an endorsement from the AU to sanitize his political dirt. Earning from his friends in Ethiopia, Farmaajo knows he can seek the involvement of the African Union because the body itself is flawed in operation: all leaders have hidden behind Article 4(g) of the AU Constitutive Act on \u201cnon-interference in internal matters\u201d of members.</p>\n\n<p>In short, he can reduce the continental body into spectators just as the neighbors did with the Tigray region.</p>\n\n<p>This is not to say the AU is a useless organization. In fact, Somalia has a lot to thank the AU for having created the AU Mission in Somalia which has been guarding Farmaajo and his palace, the Villa Somalia.</p>\n\n<p>We fear that Farmaajo has shown sufficient hypocrisy in the past. On one day he insists on sovereignty when critics pour in while on the other hand when he is facing local turmoil he rushes to the AU for help.</p>\n\n<p>The flip-flopping is meant to waste time and the best thing Farmaajo can do is to resume talks which will be the surest way to ending this fiasco.</p>\n\n<figure><a href=\"https://www.reactorreview.com/?p=28972\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<img src=\"https://i0.wp.com/www.reactorreview.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/uhurus-1.jpg?resize=626%2C392&amp;ssl=1\" alt=\"Miscalculations that cost DP Ruto special place at Uhuru\u2019s side\">\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</a></figure>\n\n<h2><a href=\"https://www.reactorreview.com/?p=28972\">Miscalculations that cost DP Ruto special place at Uhuru\u2019s side</a></h2>\n\n<p>by <a href=\"https://www.reactorreview.com/?author=1\" title=\"Posts by admin\">admin</a> | Apr 21, 2021 | <a href=\"https://www.reactorreview.com/?cat=9\">Opinion</a></p>\n\n<p>Political observers who had predicted that Uhuru Kenyatta would by now be a lame-duck president operating in the shadows of his ambitious deputy William Ruto may have been forced to reassess their prediction by the recent turn of events.</p>\n\n<p>Never before in Kenya\u2019s independence history has a vice-president wielded more power than Ruto did during Jubilee Party\u2019s first term in office from 2013 to 2017.</p>\n\n<p>With a constant presence by President Uhuru\u2019s side during that period, Ruto had a free hand in running ministries and was deeply involved in drawing up government programs and even supervising some.</p>\n\n<p>Political commentators, and some senior government officials, quietly referred to him as the power behind the throne, or even a co-president.</p>\n\n<p>Jaramogi Oginga Odinga, 1963-1966</p>\n\n<p>Out of his 10 predecessors, no other vice-president, perhaps with the exception of Jaramogi Oginga Odinga, had the moral authority to exercise the kind of unrestrained power as Ruto did.</p>\n\n<p>Jaramogi\u2019s moral authority emanated from the widely documented gesture of turning down the colonial government\u2019s offer to become Kenya\u2019s first prime minister in favor of Jomo Kenyatta, whom he felt was more deserving. Kenyatta was then in prison.</p>\n\n<p>Ruto\u2019s moral authority came from the fact that he had sacrificed his presidential ambition in 2013 in favor of Uhuru.</p>\n\n<p>In doing so, Ruto and his United Republican Party (URP) went into an equal partnership with Uhuru\u2019s The National Alliance (TNA) and defeated their main challenger Raila Odinga, who was vying under the Coalition for Reforms and Democracy (Cord) banner.</p>\n\n<p>2010 Constitution</p>\n\n<p>The 2013 pre-election partnership agreement between URP and TNA gave Ruto control of half of the government posts, among them Cabinet secretaries, principal secretaries, ambassadors and state parastatals.</p>\n\n<p>Joseph Murumbi, 1966-1967</p>\n\n<p>And in the first term of the Jubilee administration, this is where Ruto\u2019s powers lay. However, many people misjudged these powers to emanate from his office as deputy president.</p>\n\n<p>The 2010 Constitution made cosmetic changes to the Office of the deputy president \u2014 changing the name from vice-president and making it difficult for the president to fire his deputy on a whim.</p>\n\n<p>However, the deputy president\u2019s constitutional powers remained marginal, meaning the authority that Ruto exercised in Jubilee\u2019s first term was largely delegated to him by his boss.</p>\n\n<p>The personal bond between the \u201cdynamic duo\u201d, as they were referred to by the media, had been strengthened by the criminal charges they were both facing at the International Criminal Court (ICC) arising from the 2007/2008 post-election violence.</p>\n\n<p>But even during this time, a number of observers in Uhuru\u2019s inner circle had quietly voiced misgivings about the DP appearing to overreach himself.</p>\n\n<p>Daniel arap Moi. 1967-1978</p>\n\n<p>One misgiving they pointed out early was the manner in which Ruto tended to hog the limelight during presidential functions, often speaking inordinately long while enumerating government projects and policies, and leaving his boss with little to say.</p>\n\n<p>Murathe warning</p>\n\n<p>It is possible the President was not too pleased by his deputy\u2019s conduct but decided to play along for purposes of political expediency, mainly his 2017 re-election.</p>\n\n<p>On hindsight, a hint of Uhuru\u2019s displeasure came from Jubilee Party vice-chairman David Murathe, who just before the August 7, 2017, General Election, told a local TV station that Uhuru would be more assertive in his second term.</p>\n\n<p>\u201cI am very sorry for people if Uhuru gets re-elected,\u201d Murathe told KTN, \u201cBecause his agenda will be his legacy issues which will be anchored in law, order, discipline and the fight against corruption.\u201d</p>\n\n<p>Mwai Kibaki. 1978-1988</p>\n\n<p>At the time, many thought the words were directed at opposition leaders, mainly Raila, who, just like in 2013, was Uhuru\u2019s main challenger in the 2017 election.</p>\n\n<p>Looking at it now, this statement perhaps signalled President Uhuru\u2019s intention to take back the powers he had donated to his deputy in his first term.</p>\n\n<p>The President\u2019s first move was to name his a new Cabinet alone at State House after what appeared to have been a tussle with his deputy over names of new Cabinet Secretaries.</p>\n\n<p>Ruto kept away from the function, unlike in 2013 when the newly-elected leaders, clad in matching white shirts and red ties, named the Cabinet at State House.</p>\n\n<p>The President\u2019s second move was the March 2018 Handshake with Raila, an event that is said to have caught the DP unawares and which has since bitterly divided the Jubilee Party.</p>\n\n<p>The President then followed with a call that Jubilee leaders should cease premature political campaigns which had been stirred by the Handshake.</p>\n\n<p>Josephat Karanja, 1988-1989</p>\n\n<p>His call was largely seen as aimed at the DP whom Uhuru derided for \u201ctanga tanga\u201d (wandering aimlessly) all over the country.</p>\n\n<p>Church fundraisers</p>\n\n<p>Either by design or default, this statement seemed to have provided the cue to Cabinet Secretaries, Principal Secretaries and heads of parastatals to give a wide berth to the DP\u2019s countrywide tours in the name of launching government projects.</p>\n\n<p>When this line was cut off, Ruto converted his \u201cdevelopment tours\u201d to church fundraisers which allowed him to travel around the country and sell his agenda, without seeking the blessings of his boss.</p>\n\n<p>At the same time, his lieutenants in Parliament upped their raw criticism of the President and the Building Bridges Initiative (BBI) which Uhuru launched with Raila as a follow up to the Handshake.</p>\n\n<p>George Saitoti. 1989-2002</p>\n\n<p>At the same time, the DP and his foot soldiers in Parliament openly ciriticised what they termed as President Uhuru\u2019s partisan war on corruption which they claimed was targeting Ruto and his allies.</p>\n\n<p>Consequently, it forced the DP and his lieutenants take positions on the war on graft that were sometimes not only at variance with Uhuru\u2019s stand, but also public opinion.</p>\n\n<p>The DP even took it upon himself to criticize public institutions involved in the fight against the vice, thus raising questions about his allegiance.</p>\n\n<p>Musalia Mudavadi, 2002-2002</p>\n\n<p>He memorably differed with the Director of Criminal Investigations George Kinoti, over the amount of money lost in the Arror and Kimwarer dam scandals, arguing that the DCI was being used to settle political scores.</p>\n\n<p>Corruption war</p>\n\n<p>In the impeachment of Kiambu Governor Ferdinand Waititu and the prosecution of Nairobi Governor Mike Sonko, the DP\u2019s lieutenants rushed to their defence and even appeared for them in court.</p>\n\n<p>Many saw this as a bold attempt by the DP and his allies to undermine the President on the war on corruption, a fact that some of the DP\u2019s allies loudly proclaimed in public forums.</p>\n\n<p>With an eye on the 2022 presidential race, in 2016, Ruto engineered the merger of URP, TNA and other smaller parties to the Jubilee Party, despite disquiet from his Kalenjin political base.</p>\n\n<p>Kijana Wamalwa. 2003- 2003</p>\n\n<p>The thinking at the time was that it would be easier to sell Ruto\u2019s presidential candidature in Mt Kenya through a single unified party rather than through Jubilee\u2019s former affiliates.</p>\n\n<p>But given the happenings in the Jubilee Party, this is a decision that the DP must be regretting. The TNA-URP merger effectively ended the 2013 pre-election pact between Uhuru and Ruto which had given the latter half of the government where he drew his real power over the first five years. With the merger, the DP had surrendered the strongest leverage he had over the President.</p>\n\n<p>President Kenyatta, who is also the Jubilee Party leader, has deployed key his lieutenants within the party to carry out the recent coup against the DP\u2019s allies in the Senate.</p>\n\n<p>Moody Awori. 2003-2008</p>\n\n<p>Under the President\u2019s instructions, Jubilee replaced Elgeyo Marakwet Senator Kipchumba Murkomen as Majority Leader and his Nakuru counterpart Susan Kihika as Chief Whip. Both are staunch DP supporters.</p>\n\n<p>A close reading of history reveals an interesting fact that the only thing Kenya\u2019s 11th and first vice-presidents share: the manner in which they were cut down to size by the very men they helped to rise to power.</p>\n\n<p>Jaramogi\u2019s resignation</p>\n\n<p>In the three years that Jaramogi served as Mzee Kenyatta\u2019s principal assistant, their friendship had deteriorated so much over differences touching on a myriad of issues.</p>\n\n<p>Kalonzo Musyoka. 2008-2013</p>\n\n<p>Kenyatta responded by whittling down Jaramogi\u2019s influence in government, the culmination of which was demoting him to vice president without portfolio, after stripping him of his Home Affairs docket which he handed over to Daniel arap Moi.</p>\n\n<p>Basically, Jaramogi had a big office without any powers.</p>\n\n<p>Worse was to come when Kenyatta, through Jaramogi\u2019s main competitor in Cabinet and rival in Luo Nyanza politics, Tom Mboya, executed a coup within the ruling Kanu party which saw Jaramogi and his lieutenants purged out of influential positions in Kanu.</p>\n\n<p>Unable to take the humiliation any more, on April 4, 1966, Jaramogi took the high road and wrote this letter to his former ally-turned-foe:</p>\n\n<figure><a href=\"https://www.reactorreview.com/?p=28946\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<img src=\"https://i2.wp.com/www.reactorreview.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/IMG_20210420_112948.jpg?resize=1080%2C596&amp;ssl=1\" alt=\"International Community Must Reject Mogadishu Power Grab\">\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</a></figure>\n\n<h2><a href=\"https://www.reactorreview.com/?p=28946\">International Community Must Reject Mogadishu Power Grab</a></h2>\n\n<p>by <a href=\"https://www.reactorreview.com/?author=1\" title=\"Posts by admin\">admin</a> | Apr 20, 2021 | <a href=\"https://www.reactorreview.com/?cat=9\">Opinion</a></p>\n\n<p>Somali President Mohamed Abdullahi Mohamed, alias Farmajo, has extended his stay in office for a further two years. His term ended on February 8, after four years, and elections for a new president were supposed to have been held.</p>\n\n<p>Farmajo used the deadlock over the mode of voting between the federal government and the federal states as the excuse to extend his term. His government and the governments of several of the federal states are unable to agree whether to continue with the delegate system used previously, or introduce universal suffrage of one-person one-vote.</p>\n\n<p>Farmaajo has dug himself into a cul-de-sac, and there will be consequences. To begin with, the two-year period will not resolve the problem. The relations between the federal and state governments will only deteriorate further because of this impasse. There are five states, Jubbaland, Puntland, South-West, Galmudug, and Hir-Shabelle some of whom have rejected universal suffrage.</p>\n\n<p>Those that want the delegates system even want it reformed to be more democratic and transparent, something the Farmajo government has rejected. The federal government has zero capacity to force the states rejecting universal suffrage to participate in an election they don\u2019t want. Farmajo is facing an even more daunting challenge. His key international backers, principally the US and Britain, have rejected the extension of his term.</p>\n\n<p>Unfortunately, despite mumblings by some Somalis this is interference in the country\u2019s internal affairs, a government that fully relies on the goodwill of the international community for its very existence, needs to be more humble. Without these backers, the federal government would be overrun by Al Shabaab within days.</p>\n\n<p>The way out for Farmaajo is talks, but he will have to recuse himself from running for another term to give comfort to those who think he is trying to put in place a system that favours his re-election prospects. He should have put in place a care taker government of national unity to reach a consensus, and organise polls during this extension period.</p>\n\n<p>Worse for the Somali federal government, increasing challenges are compounding its problems. A resurgent Al Shabaab has intensified its bombing campaign in the capital Mogadishu in recent months, obviously taking advantage of an increasingly distracted government, and rising political tensions in the country. Somalia is in the midst of a second wave of the Covid, which has proved more deadly than the first wave.</p>\n\n<p>Infections and deaths have shot up, at a time when the poorly equipped and poorly resourced healthcare system is pushed to the limit. The chickens of Kenya finally putting its foot down over the closure of the Daadab refugee camps, are coming home to roost. Kenya has demanded that the international community put together a time bound plan to repatriate home all the 200,000 Somali refugees, and has given deadlines. Settling the refugees in Somalia will stretch the resources and logistics of the Somali government to the limit.</p>\n\n<p>And right now, its key priority is survival. The African Union has been very quiet over these developments. Normally quick off the mark to condemn military power grabs, it has refused to object as government after government has violated its country\u2019s constitution for political purposes.</p>\n\n<p>Unfortunately, Kenya cannot escape fallout from the ensuing Somali crisis. Kenya has been the focus of Farmaajo\u2019s attempts at deflecting attention from his internal problems through hysterical pronouncements that Kenya is interfering with its internal affairs. Despite Kenya denying any such interference, the fact is that Kenya cannot sit back and let Somalia mess itself up, as it is always the country that bears the brunt of the resultant chaos.</p>\n\n<p>Farmajo\u2019s power grab by tampering with constitutional term limits needs to be seen against the broader context of the continent where presidents are now routinely over throwing constitutional term limits to allow them to run, and win, third terms.</p>\n\n<p>This has drastically rolled back the democratic gains Africa made in the early years of this century, and it has been directly responsible for most of the violence and political tension that is now engulfing the continent.</p>\n\n<figure><a href=\"https://www.reactorreview.com/?p=28938\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<img src=\"https://i1.wp.com/www.reactorreview.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/EzZWT6nX0AEtwnw.jpg?resize=1080%2C675&amp;ssl=1\" alt=\"This man Fred Ngatia; From the Bar straight to the head of the Judiciary\">\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</a></figure>\n\n<h2><a href=\"https://www.reactorreview.com/?p=28938\">This man Fred Ngatia; From the Bar straight to the head of the Judiciary</a></h2>\n\n<p>by <a href=\"https://www.reactorreview.com/?author=1\" title=\"Posts by admin\">admin</a> | Apr 20, 2021 | <a href=\"https://www.reactorreview.com/?cat=9\">Opinion</a></p>\n\n<p>If Fredrick Ngatia were to be nominated by the Judicial Service Commission for appointment as Kenya\u2019s Chief Justice, he would have made a rare leap that is from the Bar straight to the head of the Judiciary.</p>\n\n<p>Only Maluki Kitili Mwendwa, Bernard Chunga and Willy Mutunga have become CJ without having held any judicial office before.</p>\n\n<p>However, this is not a bet he cannot pull off that feat. Mr Ngatia is the senior-most of the 10 CJ candidates.</p>\n\n<p>For a profession obsessed with, if not slavish about seniority, Mr Ngatia\u2019s four decades as an advocate will count on account of longevity and the title conferred to him as Senior Counsel last year.</p>\n\n<p>The apogee of his law practice is the pro bono case former Chief Justice Willy Mutunga handed him when he requested Ngatia to represent death row suspects. His success in the Francis Kariokoo Muruatetu case at the Supreme Court, where it was declared unconstitutional to impose a mandatory death sentence on convicts, is what he considers his finest piece of work. Some 5,000 prisoners have since gone back to the High Court for resentencing.</p>\n\n<p>Beyond his 40 years\u2019 experience in the practice of law, Ngatia will be brandishing his freshly minted masters in applied philosophy to prove that a CJ needs a multidisciplinary approach. He researched euthanasia, which is prohibited in Kenya, and his research found that where it is administered, the moral questions it raises demonstrate that apex courts deal with questions of bioethics, theology, the transcendental nature of man.</p>\n\n<p>Last year, Ngatia joined the hallowed ranks of Senior Counsel, and he will be battling the optics of ethnic balancing in joining a Supreme Court where another member of his Kikuyu community is also a long-serving member.</p>\n\n<p>The holder of Bachelors and Masters of Laws degrees from the University of Nairobi and the London School of Economics respectively, Mr Ngatia seeks a return to public service, having started his practice as State counsel in the office of the Attorney-General.</p>\n\n<p>Mr Ngatia then ventured into private practice where he has ploughed his trade in a firm that carries his name as principal.</p>\n\n<p>Though this company may be deemed small, if not solo practice, its clientele would speak to a heavy hitting litigation practice. Chambers &amp; Partners, an international firm that classifies lawyers, recognized Mr Ngatia as one of Kenya\u2019s best litigators in 2019.</p>\n\n<p>Ngatia\u2019s long client list includes Kamlesh Pattni when he faced a murder charge, Justice Philip Tunoi when he faced a tribunal investigating his misconduct, Judges Philomena Mwilu, Mohammed Ibrahim and Abida Ali-Aroni at the Judges and Magistrates Vetting Board, and the late Vice President George Saitoti when he challenged his prosecution over the KSh158 billion Goldenberg scandal. Ngatia also filed a complaint against Judge Joseph Mutava at the tribunal investigating him, calling him a serial liar.</p>\n\n<p>The judge was removed from office. Ngatia shot to fame with his representation of Uhuru Kenyatta in the 2017 presidential election petitions. As soon as the 1 September 2017 nullification decision came in, Ngatia began preparing for the next petition \u2013 which followed in November after the fresh election. He has managed a frenetic 14-day petition, and believes the same leadership principles would enable him to lead the institution. Yet, Ngatia does not consider the presidential petitions as his greatest achievement.</p>\n\n<p>Contentious petitions</p>\n\n<p>If an advocate can be defined by the work he does and his clients, then there is a lot to be said of Mr. Ngatia as a legal practitioner.</p>\n\n<p>Even that would be a partial and incomplete description of the breadth of Mr Ngatia\u2019s practice. Known mostly as one of the legal counsel to President Uhuru Kenyatta in the contentious petitions challenging the 2013 and 2017 elections, Mr. Ngatia is thought to be a system\u2019s advocate, if such a job exists.</p>\n\n<p>The choice of Mr. Ngatia as counsel for the high and mighty preceded the election cases.</p>\n\n<p>In 2006, Prof George Saitoti, while a minister, sought Mr Ngatia\u2019s representation in a case challenging the findings made by the Judicial Commission on the Goldenberg Affair as to the minister\u2019s involvement in the scandal.</p>\n\n<p>The court not only quashed the findings and recommendations of the Commission of Inquiry for prosecution of Mr. Ngatia\u2019s client but also thanked him and his co-counsel for the quality of their research and advocacy in the proceedings. Prof Saitoti has since died.</p>\n\n<p>Even members of the Judiciary have found themselves in need of his counsel. Justice Philip Tunoi of the Supreme Court sought Mr Ngatia\u2019s representation when the judge faced a tribunal inquiring into whether he needed to be dismissed for gross misconduct.</p>\n\n<p>While his practice is more on the corporate and commercial litigation, Mr Ngatia made a mark in the criminal bar in a case that will have a long lasting effect on the justice system in Kenya.</p>\n\n<p>Mandatory death sentences</p>\n\n<p>His representation of Mr Francis Muruatetu in the Supreme Court in 2017 changed the law in a refreshing way that points to his legal mind to give the Constitution its full tenor and effect in the lives of ordinary citizens.</p>\n\n<p>Mr Ngatia\u2019s client had challenged the Penal Code\u2019s prescription of a mandatory death sentences for a person convicted of murder. On the strength of the advocacy, the Supreme Court agreed with Mr Ngatia that mandatory capital punishment was unconstitutional.</p>\n\n<p>The court said a mandatory sentence is an unreasonable restraint on a judicial officer because it deprives the judges of the discretion to consider mitigating factors in sentencing and makes the process of mitigation an unnecessary gesture during trial.</p>\n\n<p>With this decision, many convicts on death row got a reprieve by challenging the courts to reconsider their sentences. An indirect public benefit was served by Mr Ngatia\u2019s advocacy in this case.</p>\n\n<p>The truth, though, is that some may be anxious about the possibility of Mr Ngatia as Chief Justice for the reason that his clientele indicates an advocate for the high and mighty with little time for the ordinary litigant.</p>\n\n<p>The Muruatetu case may be an answer to them as to how he perceives the constitutional liberties and rights of the common citizen. Additionally, it ears mentioning that an advocate by his professional obligation takes whichever client he finds himself with.</p>\n\n<p>Advocacy does not necessarily infer alliance with or affinity to the client\u2019s position.</p>\n\n<p>Formidable litigator</p>\n\n<p>As an advocate, Mr Ngatia is a formidable litigator described by many as polite and soft-spoken without being a pushover. It would be a mission of high guesswork to try and define the kind of judge, leave alone the kind of CJ, any person would make on appointment.</p>\n\n<p>In a presumed Justice Fred Ngatia, that would be even harder for three reasons. One is that he has never been a judge. This would only be for those who believe and act on the divisive binary of the Judiciary having insiders and outsiders.</p>\n\n<p>Secondly, it is never possible to define for a candidate what taking a judicial posting would mean for his or her personal jurisprudence.</p>\n\n<p>Thirdly, and more importantly, the obsession with personal jurisprudence sometimes is but a harbinger by which a candidate for judicial office is defined by an ideological lens, which he may not even have given thought to.</p>\n\n<p>It is never a given that a judge will decide cases in a guaranteed way , even to the administration responsible for his appointment. Those unwilling to believe this may take cue from Dwight Eisenhower who after naming Earl Warren as Chief Justice said the appointment was the worst decision of his presidency.</p>\n\n<p>Warren, a Republican on his appointment, led the Supreme Court into a set of civil rights decisions, which transformed the United States in a way that did not please the president and his Republican party.</p>\n\n<p>If Mr Ngatia were to be appointed Chief Justice, we can only guess the level of transformation he would make. No one knows for sure. The same would apply largely for all the other candidates to the office of CJ.</p>\n\n<p>However, there is no denying that Mr Ngatia has the tools for the job in terms of qualifications.</p>\n\n<figure><a href=\"https://www.reactorreview.com/?p=28899\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<img src=\"https://i2.wp.com/www.reactorreview.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/IMG_20210419_103041.jpg?resize=713%2C562&amp;ssl=1\" alt=\"An Event of Bedside Comfort, Popularity and Money Is Nothing Near A Revolution\">\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</a></figure>\n\n<h2><a href=\"https://www.reactorreview.com/?p=28899\">An Event of Bedside Comfort, Popularity and Money Is Nothing Near A Revolution</a></h2>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://twitter.com/intent/tweet?url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.reactorreview.com%2F%3Fp%3D28899&amp;via=FelixMu28970705\" data-size=\"large\">Tweet</a></p>\n\n<p>A warm cozy, room, with a hot cup of coffee or tea. Socks on and a stack of pillows near the work area. It may be done on the bed, the seat, the living room whichever place that evokes comfort, for comfort is key. Any sight of blood or sweat is despicable and unimaginable to them. For they don\u2019t like to tire and move about. They don\u2019t like to move about and the thought of just being around people is an irritant to their body especially their years. These are the individuals who claim they are revolutionists</p>\n\n<p>Back in the day until now a revolution was considered a sacrificial undertaking where humanity came out in voice and in deed to defend their cause, to fight for what they know is best, they made placards, spoke and urged and convinced people to join them in the streets and support their causes. Great revolutionists were ready to sacrifice their lives, were ready to fight and indeed fought, were ready to be arrested even if it meant going it alone. From the likes of Che Guevera a major figure in the Cuba Revolution, to Martin Luther King who fought against racism in America revolutions were not a zone of comfort but moments of sacrifice, retaliation and retribution.</p>\n\n<p>It demanded some sense of collegiality as they deemed unity in their work critical till they attain their cause and this was often reflected in the masses gathered and the progressive attainment of their goals. Even at our current moment in time we have seen the Arab Spring that has entangled countries of the Middle East and Northern Africa which has seen war and suffering as they spoke out and demanded change.</p>\n\n<p>What would have happened if they sat back on their dear beds with phones and laptops to start tweeting and commenting on anything and everything they see go through social media. Pretty much nothing. This is the situation of people in Kenya who claim they are revolutionists in the comfort of their bedsitters, in the comfort of their warm and cozy homes who spend the better part of their day and night looking for quotable quotes and tweetable tweets. The revolutionists who cannot even raise their voice on anything. They label themselves as fighters through cartoon characters of past revolutionists on their profile pictures but cannot even stand the raging sun outside, cannot gather masses and most of all, find it down right ridiculous to carry placards, screaming and shouting to capture the attention of those they want. The farthest they can do is air their views and noise through paragraphs on social media sites away from the heat, the noise and especially away from the face of the police.</p>\n\n<p>Their revolution is an open fallacy to gain clout and popularity and start making money online through following because at the end of the day they are only engaging in a selfish undertaking. There is no revolution here but a money making venture, no more no less.</p>\n\n<figure><a href=\"https://www.reactorreview.com/?p=28880\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<img src=\"https://i1.wp.com/www.reactorreview.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/file.png?resize=586%2C419&amp;ssl=1\" alt=\"A DEPUTY PRESIDENT ACTING ANGRY AND SULKING IS A SAD MOMENT FOR KENYA\">\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</a></figure>\n\n<h2><a href=\"https://www.reactorreview.com/?p=28880\">A DEPUTY PRESIDENT ACTING ANGRY AND SULKING IS A SAD MOMENT FOR KENYA</a></h2>\n\n<p>by <a href=\"https://www.reactorreview.com/?author=1\" title=\"Posts by admin\">admin</a> | Apr 17, 2021 | <a href=\"https://www.reactorreview.com/?cat=9\">Opinion</a></p>\n\n<p>\u201cGiven the opportunity to be President, I would not allow my Deputy President to be humiliated the way I have been humiliated\u201d ~ Dr. William Samoei Ruto.</p>\n\n<p>Many KENYANS may have missed an important show as they were busy analyzing KCPE results. Allow us to REVISIT the interview.</p>\n\n<p>On citizen Tv, a very shocking interview took place. The deputy PRESIDENT William Ruto was lamenting. His lamentations were candid.</p>\n\n<p>He clearly lamented on his disappointment on how his boss UHURU KENYATTA has worked with him/handled him. He said UHURU had humiliated him.</p>\n\n<p>\u201cGiven the opportunity to be President, I would not allow my Deputy President to be humiliated the way I have been humiliated\u201d ~</p>\n\n<p>We thought that DP knows that politicians in Kenya practice political polygamy. So, for him to start sulking so late in the day that there are other partners in his marriage with Uhuru is hypocritical. His entire career has been about cross-breeding from Kanu to ODM, to URP to Jubilee, etc. So what\u2019s pinching his big toe now?</p>\n\n<p>The DP acted victim during the interview, blaming everyone and everything for his problems with his boss. He forgot his words of \u201cIn 6 months\u2019 time the Stadium in Wote will be complete, in another 6 months\u2019 time Kamariny Stadium will be complete!\u201d</p>\n\n<p>He said and I quote..</p>\n\n<p>\u201cI asked the president to produce information showing what I had done in private and in public to disrespect him or to elevated myself beyond what my duties are and the president was very candid with me, he told me there is no such information. The director of intelligence was there and he also did not produce any information on the same,\u201d he added.</p>\n\n<p>Bwana Ruto Do you need the DCI to remind you that In 2013, a court found you guilty of grabbing 100 acres piece of land belonging to one Adrian Muteshi. You were ordered to return the land and also pay Muteshi ksh5m for trespassing on his land? Is this not info to show wrongdoing on your part?</p>\n\n<p>Dp Ruto then went ahead and blamed the drunkenness of Jubilee leaders for failed promises. He said and I quote\u2026</p>\n\n<p>\u201cI have tried all I could to see if we could work all this out in Jubilee\u2026Unfortunately, those who call the shots are hardly sober. They appear on national TV drunk\u2026That is the level of impunity\u201d</p>\n\n<p>The question that begs is, DP, If your character &amp; integrity is unquestionable, you are an angel, but the rest in your Jubilee company are drunkards, why don\u2019t you RESIGN from the system? Bible says bad company ruins good morals. Quit that bad company called Jubilee! History will judge you harshly if you tag along that bandwagon of drunkards.</p>\n\n<p>To crown his interview, Ruto boasted.</p>\n\n<p>\u201cIf Raila Odinga will not be my opponent then who will be?\u201d.</p>\n\n<p>The problem with Ruto is pride and overconfidence. The way he looks down on other leaders makes me sick. He forgets what Papa Atwoli told us. Uhuru is too young to retire.</p>\n\n<p>DP is simply saying, that Uhuru, Musalia Mudavadi, Kalonzo, Weta, and Gideon Moi are nothing. To him, the only person that can compete with him is Raila.</p>\n\n<p>He probably sponsored the interview to show Kenyans he is the victim while Kenyans already know his past. And come 2022 he will be judged by his past. He killed 1000s of Kikuyus in Rift Valley for power and the powerful Mt Kenya region has judged him already and found him lacking.</p>\n\n</article>"},{"url": "https://www.reactorreview.com/?p=28858", "probability": 0.9769623, "headline": "Steps In The Direction Of More Resilient Post-Covid Economies", "datePublished": "2021-04-16T00:00:00", "datePublishedRaw": "Apr 16, 2021", "dateModified": "2021-04-16T04:38:01+00:00", "dateModifiedRaw": "2021-04-16T04:38:01+00:00", "author": "admin", "authorsList": ["admin"], "inLanguage": "en", "mainImage": "https://i0.wp.com/www.reactorreview.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/IMG_20210416_073346.jpg?fit=1080%2C528&ssl=1", "images": ["https://i0.wp.com/www.reactorreview.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/IMG_20210416_073346.jpg?resize=1080%2C528&ssl=1"], "description": "Economies across Africa have experienced dramatic slowdown even countries with limited initial incidence of the virus faced severe economic aftershocks.

Significant disruption in agricultural markets and labour in sub-Saharan Africa has restricted income and led to rapid food insecurity for many.\n\nEnsuring emergency financial support could reach people quickly became a priority for many governments, but with lockdowns and social distancing, traditional means of distributing relief were unavailable. Countries which had invested in making financial systems more inclusive mitigated the most severe economic shocks to households.\n\nThe ability of the countries to act wasn\u2019t built on radical reinvention, but rather on effective use of established solutions that drive digitisation, growth and inclusion. Of course, there is a limit to how much countries can expand financial access amid a crisis, so the time to upgrade financial policies and infrastructure to drive inclusion is now.\n\nAs African and global leaders look to implement plans following discussions at the World Bank and\nIMF Spring Meetings last week about steps countries can take to rebuild economies from the pandemic, they need not reinvent the wheel. Here are three suggestions for how countries can make economies more resilient to future shocks.\n\nFirst, countries should craft financial services regulations that provide space for companies and industry to innovate while safeguarding consumers against risks, including data privacy and cyber security. When countries get financial regulations right, the benefits of financial inclusion can accrue rapidly. Governments also need to increase ability to identify citizens and transact with them safely and quickly.\n\nInvesting in inclusive digital payment and identity infrastructure is the second step governments should take to rebuild financial systems and build more resilient economies. During the pandemic, countries\nwith high levels of payment and ID connectivity could quickly identify and deliver payments to households eligible for emergency funds.\n\nDigital payment and ID systems eliminated the need for people to complete paper forms or contend with crowded lines to receive emergency funds; they could apply online or by SMS and be paid digitally. By contrast, countries with limited payment connectivity and identity systems had less effective options.\n\nSome governments had to physically deliver cash, while others relied on social protection measures, such as subsidising the price of food or fuel. Fortunately, governments seeking to upgrade their digital financial systems need not start from scratch. They can make use of new, open-source payment and identity platforms built on best-in-class privacy, data protection and cyber security frameworks.\n\nThese innovations are accelerating digital financial inclusion in several countries. Ethiopia and Guinea are exploring pilots based on the MOSIP platform. A third step governments can take to build more resilient economies is to put women front and centre. A growing body of experimental evidence demonstrates that getting money into the hands of women to connect them to the formal financial system can lead to long-term benefits, including more decision making power in their household and greater economic security.\n\nThrough targeted emergency payment systems, enabled by strong, inclusive digital financial systems, governments have bolstered economic activity and supported women during the pandemic. An understanding of the outcomes of rapid response measures undertaken by governments to alleviate the economic impact of the pandemic will take time. It is clear, however, that over the last year, governments have preserved millions of lives and livelihoods through use of inclusive digital financial infrastructure.\n\nAs we emerge from the pandemic, governments have a chance to use lessons from the crisis to build the inclusive financial systems they will need to respond to future economic crises. By doing this, they can also position their economies for growth and resiliency in this digital century.", "articleBodyHtml": "<article>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://twitter.com/intent/tweet?url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.reactorreview.com%2F%3Fp%3D28858&amp;via=FelixMu28970705\" data-size=\"large\">Tweet</a></p>\n\n<p>Economies across Africa have experienced dramatic slowdown even countries with limited initial incidence of the virus faced severe economic aftershocks.

Of course, there is a limit to how much countries can expand financial access amid a crisis, so the time to upgrade financial policies and infrastructure to drive inclusion is now.</p>\n\n<p>As African and global leaders look to implement plans following discussions at the World Bank and<br>\nIMF Spring Meetings last week about steps countries can take to rebuild economies from the pandemic, they need not reinvent the wheel. Here are three suggestions for how countries can make economies more resilient to future shocks.</p>\n\n<p>First, countries should craft financial services regulations that provide space for companies and industry to innovate while safeguarding consumers against risks, including data privacy and cyber security. When countries get financial regulations right, the benefits of financial inclusion can accrue rapidly. Governments also need to increase ability to identify citizens and transact with them safely and quickly.</p>\n\n<p>Investing in inclusive digital payment and identity infrastructure is the second step governments should take to rebuild financial systems and build more resilient economies. During the pandemic, countries<br>\nwith high levels of payment and ID connectivity could quickly identify and deliver payments to households eligible for emergency funds.</p>\n\n<p>Digital payment and ID systems eliminated the need for people to complete paper forms or contend with crowded lines to receive emergency funds; they could apply online or by SMS and be paid digitally. By contrast, countries with limited payment connectivity and identity systems had less effective options.</p>\n\n<p>Some governments had to physically deliver cash, while others relied on social protection measures, such as subsidising the price of food or fuel. Fortunately, governments seeking to upgrade their digital financial systems need not start from scratch. They can make use of new, open-source payment and identity platforms built on best-in-class privacy, data protection and cyber security frameworks.</p>\n\n<p>These innovations are accelerating digital financial inclusion in several countries. Ethiopia and Guinea are exploring pilots based on the MOSIP platform. A third step governments can take to build more resilient economies is to put women front and centre. A growing body of experimental evidence demonstrates that getting money into the hands of women to connect them to the formal financial system can lead to long-term benefits, including more decision making power in their household and greater economic security.</p>\n\n<p>Through targeted emergency payment systems, enabled by strong, inclusive digital financial systems, governments have bolstered economic activity and supported women during the pandemic. An understanding of the outcomes of rapid response measures undertaken by governments to alleviate the economic impact of the pandemic will take time. It is clear, however, that over the last year, governments have preserved millions of lives and livelihoods through use of inclusive digital financial infrastructure.</p>\n\n<p>As we emerge from the pandemic, governments have a chance to use lessons from the crisis to build the inclusive financial systems they will need to respond to future economic crises. By doing this, they can also position their economies for growth and resiliency in this digital century.</p>\n\n</article>", "canonicalUrl": "https://www.reactorreview.com/?p=28858"},{"url": "https://www.reactorreview.com/?p=28880", "probability": 0.9840835, "headline": "A DEPUTY PRESIDENT ACTING ANGRY AND SULKING IS A SAD MOMENT FOR KENYA", "datePublished": "2021-04-17T00:00:00", "datePublishedRaw": "Apr 17, 2021", "dateModified": "2021-04-19T12:42:55+00:00", "dateModifiedRaw": "2021-04-19T12:42:55+00:00", "author": "admin", "authorsList": ["admin"], "inLanguage": "en", "mainImage": "https://i1.wp.com/www.reactorreview.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/file.png?fit=586%2C419&ssl=1", "images": ["https://i1.wp.com/www.reactorreview.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/file.png?resize=586%2C419&ssl=1", "https://secure.gravatar.com/avatar/79818052b835414a173c0dadcc9e9f44?s=150&d=mm&r=g"], "description": "\u201cGiven the opportunity to be President, I would not allow my Deputy President to be humiliated the way I have been humiliated\u201d ~ Dr. William Samoei Ruto.

But alas the tables of urned and apart from the already existing loot from the likes of Waluke, Kihika and Murkomen, things are not all rosy for they have been exposed in several exposes that have confirmed how public money has been siphoned and directed to their pockets in well schemed and fueled scandals.\n\nFor Ruto, it was an elaborate plan that he has been using to fuel his campaign, buy and manufacture goons, fund his so-called foot soldiers and make payments for the unmentioned lot to do the \u2018dirty\u2019 work, some of whom have consumed the likes of Kenei. Jacob Juma among others, but that is besides the point. This time round the Civil Society seems to have seen the light on who Ruto really is, they have seen the light on his corrupt nature and how his expends public money that goes directly to his already fat pockets. This man Ruto has never been worn out of pocketing taxpayers money. If there was a word that could be likened to a kleptomaniac it would probably be coined as Kleprutomaniac but for this one it would be one who has an addiction for the big bucks including anything land and anything that spells billions no matter what the cost.\n\nDiscovered now to be a Saint of the devil, the Civil Society has realized that they have been backing a man who goes against their statutes as a society. Renowned joiurnalist John Allan Nyamu who for years was known for his success and in-depth and truthful investigative stories is now a part of the Civil society under Africa Uncensored but be it as it may his journalistic instinct and quest for the truth exposed Ruto\u2019s anomaly to a Civil Society that had once been veiled by Ruto to believe that he was fighting for the rights of the \u2018Wanjiku\u2019 but it was all about his political ambitions that were centred on power, dictatorship and control.\n\nOver the past Namu has revealed how DP Ruto and his office holders have strategically been involved in similar contracts for not one or two or three contracts but eight consecutive years. This is unethical and illegal in the issuing of tenders and contracts as it clearly displays biasness. This, the Civil Society has failed to justify and is now beginning to see the truth on Ruto\u2019s corrupt nature of grand theft.

This time round the Civil Society seems to have seen the light on who Ruto really is, they have seen the light on his corrupt nature and how his expends public money that goes directly to his  already fat pockets. This man Ruto has never been worn out of pocketing taxpayers money.

This is unethical and illegal in the issuing of tenders and contracts as it clearly displays biasness.

long maintained close cooperation with the international community in poverty alleviation and rural development, and expects to deepen such cooperation, Wang Zhengpu, head of the national administration for rural vitalization, said on Monday.\n\nChina\u2019s poverty reduction practices, including increased investment in infrastructure construction, targeted poverty alleviation and the mobilization of the country\u2019s impoverished population, are applicable in other countries, Wang said at a sub-forum of the Boao Forum for Asia annual conference.\n\n\u201cNow that China has eradicated absolute poverty nationwide, we are willing to share our experience with the rest of the world and contribute to the global cause of poverty reduction,\u201d he said.\n\nHe added that China is learning from the experience of other countries in pushing forward its ongoing rural vitalization drive, and hopes for more support and assistance from the international community.\n\nWang\u2019s views were echoed by Jeffrey Sachs, an American economist and author of the bestselling book \u201cThe End of Poverty.\u201d Sachs attended the sub-forum and gave a speech by video link.\n\nSachs said that China\u2019s poverty alleviation success is an important model and can provide assistance for Africa in the latter\u2019s own quest for development.\n\nSachs said he appreciated that China will

Direction Of More Resilient Post-Covid Economies\n\nby admin | Apr 16, 2021 | , Opinion, World\n\nTweet\n\nEconomies across Africa have experienced dramatic slowdown even countries with limited initial incidence of the virus faced severe economic aftershocks. Significant disruption in agricultural markets and labour in sub-Saharan Africa has restricted income and led to rapid food insecurity for many.\n\nEnsuring emergency financial support could reach people quickly became a priority for many governments, but with lockdowns and social distancing, traditional means of distributing relief were unavailable. Countries which had invested in making financial systems more inclusive mitigated the most severe economic shocks to households.\n\nThe ability of the countries to act wasn\u2019t built on radical reinvention, but rather on effective use of established solutions that drive digitisation, growth and inclusion. Of course, there is a limit to how much countries can expand financial access amid a crisis, so the time to upgrade financial policies and infrastructure to drive inclusion is now.\n\nAs African and global leaders look to implement plans following discussions at the World Bank and\nIMF Spring Meetings last week about steps countries can take to rebuild economies from the pandemic, they need not reinvent the wheel. Here are three suggestions for how countries can make economies more resilient to future shocks.\n\nFirst, countries should craft financial services regulations that provide space for companies and industry to innovate while safeguarding consumers against risks, including data privacy and cyber security. When countries get financial regulations right, the benefits of financial inclusion can accrue rapidly. Governments also need to increase ability to identify citizens and transact with them safely and quickly.\n\nInvesting in inclusive digital payment and identity infrastructure is the second step governments should take to rebuild financial systems and build more resilient economies. During the pandemic, countries\nwith high levels of payment and ID connectivity could quickly identify and deliver payments to households eligible for emergency funds.\n\nDigital payment and ID systems eliminated the need for people to complete paper forms or contend with crowded lines to receive emergency funds; they could apply online or by SMS and be paid digitally. By contrast, countries with limited payment connectivity and identity systems had less effective options.\n\nSome governments had to physically deliver cash, while others relied on social protection measures, such as subsidising the price of food or fuel. Fortunately, governments seeking to upgrade their digital financial systems need not start from scratch. They can make use of new, open-source payment and identity platforms built on best-in-class privacy, data protection and cyber security frameworks.\n\nThese innovations are accelerating digital financial inclusion in several countries. Ethiopia and Guinea are exploring pilots based on the MOSIP platform. A third step governments can take to build more resilient economies is to put women front and centre. A growing body of experimental evidence demonstrates that getting money into the hands of women to connect them to the formal financial system can lead to long-term benefits, including more decision making power in their household and greater economic security.\n\nThrough targeted emergency payment systems, enabled by strong, inclusive digital financial systems, governments have bolstered economic activity and supported women during the pandemic. An understanding of the outcomes of rapid response measures undertaken by governments to alleviate the economic impact of the pandemic will take time. It is clear, however, that over the last year, governments have preserved millions of lives and livelihoods through use of inclusive digital financial infrastructure.\n\nAs we emerge from the pandemic, governments have a chance to use lessons from the crisis to build the inclusive financial systems they will need to respond to future economic crises. By doing this, they can also position their economies for growth and resiliency in this digital century.\n\nUS, EU condemn move to extend Somalia president\u2019s term\n\nby admin | Apr 14, 2021 | World\n\nTweet\n\nThe United States and European Union have condemned the move by Somalia\u2019s parliament to extend the terms of the president and members of parliament by two years amid concern it could deepen divides in the country.\n\nUS Secretary of State Antony Blinken said he was \u201cdeeply disappointed\u201d by the approval of the legislation on Tuesday.\n\n\u201cImplementation of this bill will pose serious obstacles to dialogue and further undermine peace and security in Somalia,\u201d Blinken said in a statement.\n\n\u201cIt will compel the United States to reevaluate our bilateral relations with the Federal Government of Somalia, to include diplomatic engagement and assistance, and to consider all available tools, including sanctions and visa restrictions, to respond to efforts to undermine peace and stability,\u201d he said.\n\nSomalia\u2019s lower house of parliament voted on Monday to extend President Mohamed Abdullahi Mohamed\u2019s four-year term, which expired in February, for a further two years.\n\nLower House speaker Mohamed Mursal Sheikh Abdurahman said the measure would allow the country to prepare for direct elections but the speaker of the Senate upper house, which would normally have to approve the legislation, immediately condemned the move as unconstitutional.\n\nAbdi Hashi Abdullahi warned it would \u201clead the country into political instability, risks of insecurity and other unpredictable situations.\u201d\n\nThe president and the leaders of Somalia\u2019s five semi-autonomous federal states had reached an agreement in September to prepare for indirect parliamentary and presidential elections in late 2020 and early 2021.\n\nBut the deal fell apart amid squabbles over how to conduct the vote.\n\nThe political crisis threatens to deepen Somalia\u2019s divisions, distracting attention from the fight against the al-Qaeda-linked al-Shabab in which thousands of civilians across the region have died over the past 12 years.\n\nThe African Union, European Union, United Nations, and the regional bloc, the Intergovernmental Authority on Development, said in a joint statement on Saturday that they would not support any extension of the president\u2019s term.\n\nAfter the extension was agreed the EU\u2019s foreign policy chief Josep Borrell warned of the threat to stability.\n\n\u201cThe European Union believes that the passage and signing of this resolution will divide Somalia, impose additional delays and constitute a grave threat to the peace and stability of Somalia and its neighbors,\u201d Borrell said in a statement.\n\n\u201cIt certainly does not serve the interests of the people of Somalia,\u201d he added.\n\nThe international community has urged that immediate elections be held.\n\nSomalia has not had an effective central government since the collapse of Siad Barre\u2019s military government in 1991, which led to decades of civil war and lawlessness fuelled by clan conflicts.\n\nThe country is currently governed under an interim constitution and its institutions, such as the army, are backed up with international support.\n\nWar on Terror: Pentagon Chief Orders New Review of Attack That Killed 3 Americans in Kenya\n\nby admin | Apr 13, 2021 | News, World\n\nTweet\n\nThe unusual review of the conclusions of the initial inquiry comes more than a year after the attack by the Shabab revealed security lapses at the base.\n\nDefense Secretary Lloyd J. Austin III has ordered a high-level review of an initial military investigation into an attack on a Kenyan base by Islamic extremists in January 2020 that left three Americans dead, the Pentagon said on Monday.\n\nIn a written statement announcing Austin\u2019s decision, his press secretary, John Kirby, did not pinpoint what Austin found lacking in the initial investigation, which was conducted by U.S. Africa Command. By apparent coincidence, Austin plans to meet with Africa Command officials Tuesday in Stuttgart, Germany, as part of a broader tour of Europe to consult with allies and talk to U.S. commanders. He also will meet separately with officials at the U.S. European Command, also in Stuttgart.\n\n\u201cAn independent review will provide added insight, perspective, and the ability to assess the totality of this tragic event involving multiple military services and Department of Defense components,\u201d Kirby said.\n\nAFRICOM is now examining the security at Manda Bay, and of other U.S. installations throughout the entire continent.\n\nKirby said that after considering the results of Africa Command\u2019s investigation, which have not been released publicly, Austin decided to order the Army to pick a four-star general to conduct the review. The Army chose Gen. Paul Funk, commander of Army Training and Doctrine Command. Funk is an experienced combat veteran who served six deployments in the wars in Iraq and Afghanistan.\n\n\u201cIt is the secretary\u2019s desire to ensure there is a full examination and consideration of the contributing factors that led to this tragic event and that appropriate action is taken to reduce the risk of future occurrence,\u201d Kirby said. \u201cThe families impacted deserve nothing less.\u201d\n\nThe attack by al-Shabab militants at the Manda Bay base destroyed six aircraft in addition to killing three Americans and wounding three others.\n\nSpc. Henry Mayfield Jr. died during an al-Shabab attack on Jan. 5, 2020, in Manda Bay, Kenya. (Facebook)\nShabab militants from Somalia may have received help from Kenyans for deadly Manda Bay attack\nU.S. Africa Command officials believe that al-Shabab militants from Somalia crossed the border into Kenya to conduct an attack on U.S. and Kenyan forces earlier this month in Manda Bay \u2014 with the assistance of facilitators within Kenya.\n\nThe base, in the Kenyan seaside resort, was overrun by 30 to 40 of the al-Qaida-linked insurgents on Jan. 5, 2020, marking al-Shabab\u2019s first attack against U.S. forces in the East African country. The predawn assault triggered a lengthy firefight and daylong struggle for U.S. and Kenyan forces to search and secure the base.\n\nThe base at Manda Bay has been used for years by the U.S. military, but it only became a full-time airfield in 2016, with increased personnel, aircraft and operations.\n\nThe initial phase of the assault came near dawn, when 20 to 30 al-Shabab militants slipped through the forest and fired rocket-propelled grenades onto the airfield at the base. The opening rounds of grenades quickly killed a soldier in a truck and wounded another, and killed two contractors in an aircraft and wounded one other. About a mile down the road, other militants fired on Camp Simba, a section of the base where U.S. forces are stationed.\n\nMarines from Camp Simba initially responded to the attack site and begin to fight back against the militants, who had made it onto the airfield and into buildings. But it took all day for Kenyan and U.S. security forces to finally quash the attack, search the airfield and secure the area.\n\nAir Force Col. Chris Karns, spokesperson for U.S. Africa Command, said a \u201cgreat deal of rigor\u201d was put into the investigation, resulting in a number of immediate improvements. He said the goal has been to reassure the families and the American public \u201cthat we did everything possible to understand the situation and take appropriate action.\u201d\n\nThe investigation team made \u201cfindings and recommendations that fall outside U.S. Africa Command purview and ability to effect, therefore we fully support the additional independent review directed by the Secretary of Defense,\u201d Karns said. \u201cWe are confident in the report\u2019s findings and remain committed to ensuring fixes and improvements in Kenya and across the continent.\u201d\n\nKenya has been a key base for fighting al-Shabab, which is based in Somalia and is one of the world\u2019s most resilient extremist organizations. Al-Shabab has launched a number of attacks inside Kenya, including against civilian targets on buses, at schools and at shopping malls.\n\nAl-Shabab had been the target of a growing number of U.S. airstrikes inside Somalia during President Donald Trump\u2019s administration. But Trump late last year ordered the withdrawal of the roughly 700 American forces there, and the bulk of those troops were pulled out of the country by mid-January. According to officials, there are well below 100 U.S. troops in Somalia now.\n\nAustin has launched a review of America\u2019s military posture around the world.\n\nby admin | Apr 9, 2021 | News, World\n\nTweet\n\nComing from the royal Greek and Danish families, 18-year-old Philip first caught the eye of Princess Elizabeth (at the time) in 1939, when she was just 13 years old and he was a young cadet enrolled in the Royal Naval College in Dartmouth.\n\nWhen royal family accounts tell the story of Queen Elizabeth and Prince Philip, it is often likened to a fairy-tale-like sequence of events for the couple. Philip wasn\u2019t deemed as the most ideal candidate for princess Elizabeth by her father King George VI due to his financial dependence and being a bit rough around the edges.\n\nDespite the obstacle, Philip was given permission to propose to Elizabeth by 1947, which happened in Scotland. Having had renounced his birth titles \u2013 His Royal Highness Prince Philip of Greece and Denmark \u2013 and after becoming a British subject, Philip then married the future queen of England.\n\nFormer Prime Minister Winston Churchill called their wedding a \u201cflash of color on the hard road we have to travel\u201d, referring to the climate of post-war Britain.\n\nThe title of the Duke of Edinburgh was bestowed upon Philip and he carried it through more than seven decades of married life to the woman who became the longest-reigning British monarch, having commemorated 65 years on the throne back in 2017.\n\n\u201cHe has, quite simply, been my strength and stay all these years,\u201d said the Queen on their golden wedding anniversary in 1997.\nThe royal couple had lived abroad when Prince Philip was stationed in the Royal Navy in Malta, where his spouse lived the life of a naval wife from 1949-1951.\n\nPhilip was the one to break the news to his wife of her father\u2019s death in 1952, following which Elizabeth II ascended to the throne in 1953.\n\nTheir love affair was bound to undergo its fair share of rough patches, with the role of the cohort being assigned to Prince Philip, who wasn\u2019t fond of it and said so on many occasions.\n\nWhen Philip\u2019s biographer Gyles Brandreth asked him how he thought he was perceived, he said: \u201cI don\u2019t know. A refugee husband, I suppose\u201d.\n\nThe couple had to see three of their children end their marriages in 1992 and the confirmation of the love affair between their first-born son Charles and Camilla Parker Bowles. In the many years of her reign, the Queen has admitted that her husband played a major role as her supporter.\n\n\u201cHe has, quite simply, been my strength and stay all these years, and I, and his whole family, and this and many other countries, owe him a debt greater than he would ever claim, or we shall ever know,\u201d the Queen said about Prince Philip.\n\nBritain\u2019s Prince Philip sits in the driving seat of a car, talking to his wife, Queen Elizabeth II\nIn 2017, the royal couple celebrates 70 years together, which prompted another comment by the Queen.\n\n\u201cWhen we were married I don\u2019t think there was such a thing as a platinum anniversary, they didn\u2019t know we would be around that long,\u201d she said at the time.\nThe Duke of Edinburgh was meant to celebrate his 100th birthday in June when Brits will also mark Her Majesty The Queen\u2019s Platinum Jubilee \u2013 the first time any British monarch has reached this historic milestone.\n\nA marriage that lasted through 74 years in the public eye and hundreds of official trips and events, ended on 9 April with the passing of the Duke of Edinburgh.", "articleBodyHtml": "<article>\n\n<figure><a href=\"https://www.reactorreview.com/?p=28989\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<img src=\"https://i0.wp.com/www.reactorreview.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/SEC_75455505.jpg?resize=644%2C338&amp;ssl=1\" alt=\"Unchartered Territory!

data-size=\"large\">Tweet</a></p>\n\n<p>Economies across Africa have experienced dramatic slowdown even countries with limited initial incidence of the virus faced severe economic aftershocks. Significant disruption in agricultural markets and labour in sub-Saharan Africa has restricted income and led to rapid food insecurity for many.</p>\n\n<p>Ensuring emergency financial support could reach people quickly became a priority for many governments, but with lockdowns and social distancing, traditional means of distributing relief were unavailable. Countries which had invested in making financial systems more inclusive mitigated the most severe economic shocks to households.</p>\n\n<p>The ability of the countries to act wasn\u2019t built on radical reinvention, but rather on effective use of established solutions that drive digitisation, growth and inclusion. Of course, there is a limit to how much countries can expand financial access amid a crisis, so the time to upgrade financial policies and infrastructure to drive inclusion is now.</p>\n\n<p>As African and global leaders look to implement plans following discussions at the World Bank and<br>\nIMF Spring Meetings last week about steps countries can take to rebuild economies from the pandemic, they need not reinvent the wheel. Here are three suggestions for how countries can make economies more resilient to future shocks.</p>\n\n<p>First, countries should craft financial services regulations that provide space for companies and industry to innovate while safeguarding consumers against risks, including data privacy and cyber security. When countries get financial regulations right, the benefits of financial inclusion can accrue rapidly. Governments also need to increase ability to identify citizens and transact with them safely and quickly.</p>\n\n<p>Investing in inclusive digital payment and identity infrastructure is the second step governments should take to rebuild financial systems and build more resilient economies. During the pandemic, countries<br>\nwith high levels of payment and ID connectivity could quickly identify and deliver payments to households eligible for emergency funds.</p>\n\n<p>Digital payment and ID systems eliminated the need for people to complete paper forms or contend with crowded lines to receive emergency funds; they could apply online or by SMS and be paid digitally. By contrast, countries with limited payment connectivity and identity systems had less effective options.</p>\n\n<p>Some governments had to physically deliver cash, while others relied on social protection measures, such as subsidising the price of food or fuel. Fortunately, governments seeking to upgrade their digital financial systems need not start from scratch. They can make use of new, open-source payment and identity platforms built on best-in-class privacy, data protection and cyber security frameworks.</p>\n\n<p>These innovations are accelerating digital financial inclusion in several countries. Ethiopia and Guinea are exploring pilots based on the MOSIP platform. A third step governments can take to build more resilient economies is to put women front and centre. A growing body of experimental evidence demonstrates that getting money into the hands of women to connect them to the formal financial system can lead to long-term benefits, including more decision making power in their household and greater economic security.</p>\n\n<p>Through targeted emergency payment systems, enabled by strong, inclusive digital financial systems, governments have bolstered economic activity and supported women during the pandemic. An understanding of the outcomes of rapid response measures undertaken by governments to alleviate the economic impact of the pandemic will take time. It is clear, however, that over the last year, governments have preserved millions of lives and livelihoods through use of inclusive digital financial infrastructure.</p>\n\n<p>As we emerge from the pandemic, governments have a chance to use lessons from the crisis to build the inclusive financial systems they will need to respond to future economic crises. By doing this, they can also position their economies for growth and resiliency in this digital century.</p>\n\n<figure><a href=\"https://www.reactorreview.com/?p=28812\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<img

have condemned the move by Somalia\u2019s parliament to extend the terms of the president and members of parliament by two years amid concern it could deepen divides in the country.</p>\n\n<p>US Secretary of State Antony Blinken said he was \u201cdeeply disappointed\u201d by the approval of the legislation on Tuesday.</p>\n\n<p>\u201cImplementation of this bill will pose serious obstacles to dialogue and further undermine peace and security in Somalia,\u201d Blinken said in a statement.</p>\n\n<p>\u201cIt will compel the United States to reevaluate our bilateral relations with the Federal Government of Somalia, to include diplomatic engagement and assistance, and to consider all available tools, including sanctions and visa restrictions, to respond to efforts to undermine peace and stability,\u201d he said.</p>\n\n<p>Somalia\u2019s lower house of parliament voted on Monday to extend President Mohamed Abdullahi Mohamed\u2019s four-year term, which expired in February, for a further two years.</p>\n\n<p>Lower House speaker Mohamed Mursal Sheikh Abdurahman said the measure would allow the country to prepare for direct elections but the speaker of the Senate upper house, which would normally have to approve the legislation, immediately condemned the move as unconstitutional.</p>\n\n<p>Abdi Hashi Abdullahi warned it would \u201clead the country into political instability, risks of insecurity and other unpredictable situations.\u201d</p>\n\n<p>The president and the leaders of Somalia\u2019s five semi-autonomous federal states had reached an agreement in September to prepare for indirect parliamentary and presidential elections in late 2020 and early 2021.</p>\n\n<p>But the deal fell apart amid squabbles over how to conduct the vote.</p>\n\n<p>The political crisis threatens to deepen Somalia\u2019s divisions, distracting attention from the fight against the al-Qaeda-linked al-Shabab in which thousands of civilians across the region have died over the past 12 years.</p>\n\n<p>The African Union, European Union, United Nations, and the regional bloc, the Intergovernmental Authority on Development, said in a joint statement on Saturday that they would not support any extension of the president\u2019s term.</p>\n\n<p>After the extension was agreed the EU\u2019s foreign policy chief Josep Borrell warned of the threat to stability.</p>\n\n<p>\u201cThe European Union believes that the passage and signing of this resolution will divide Somalia, impose additional delays and constitute a grave threat to the peace and stability of Somalia and its neighbors,\u201d Borrell said in a statement.</p>\n\n<p>\u201cIt certainly does not serve the interests of the people of Somalia,\u201d he added.</p>\n\n<p>The international community has urged that immediate elections be held.</p>\n\n<p>Somalia has not had an effective central government since the collapse of Siad Barre\u2019s military government in 1991, which led to decades of civil war and lawlessness fuelled by clan conflicts.</p>\n\n<p>The country is currently governed under an interim constitution and its institutions, such as the army, are backed up with international support.</p>\n\n<figure><a href=\"https://www.reactorreview.com/?p=28772\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<img

base.</em></p>\n\n<p>Defense Secretary Lloyd J. Austin III has ordered a high-level review of an initial military investigation into an attack on a Kenyan base by Islamic extremists in January 2020 that left three Americans dead, the Pentagon said on Monday.</p>\n\n<p>In a written statement announcing Austin\u2019s decision, his press secretary, John Kirby, did not pinpoint what Austin found lacking in the initial investigation, which was conducted by U.S. Africa Command. By apparent coincidence, Austin plans to meet with Africa Command officials Tuesday in Stuttgart, Germany, as part of a broader tour of Europe to consult with allies and talk to U.S. commanders. He also will meet separately with officials at the U.S. European Command, also in Stuttgart.</p>\n\n<p>\u201cAn independent review will provide added insight, perspective, and the ability to assess the totality of this tragic event involving multiple military services and Department of Defense components,\u201d Kirby said.</p>\n\n<p>AFRICOM is now examining the security at Manda Bay, and of other U.S. installations throughout the entire continent.</p>\n\n<p>Kirby said that after considering the results of Africa Command\u2019s investigation, which have not been released publicly, Austin decided to order the Army to pick a four-star general to conduct the review. The Army chose Gen. Paul Funk, commander of Army Training and Doctrine Command. Funk is an experienced combat veteran who served six deployments in the wars in Iraq and Afghanistan.</p>\n\n<p>\u201cIt is the secretary\u2019s desire to ensure there is a full examination and consideration of the contributing factors that led to this tragic event and that appropriate action is taken to reduce the risk of future occurrence,\u201d Kirby said. \u201cThe families impacted deserve nothing less.\u201d</p>\n\n<p>The attack by al-Shabab militants at the Manda Bay base destroyed six aircraft in addition to killing three Americans and wounding three others.</p>\n\n<p>Spc. Henry Mayfield Jr. died during an al-Shabab attack on Jan. 5, 2020, in Manda Bay, Kenya. (Facebook)<br>\nShabab militants from Somalia may have received help from Kenyans for deadly Manda Bay attack<br>\nU.S. Africa Command officials believe that al-Shabab militants from Somalia crossed the border into Kenya to conduct an attack on U.S. and Kenyan forces earlier this month in Manda Bay \u2014 with the assistance of facilitators within Kenya.</p>\n\n<p>The base, in the Kenyan seaside resort, was overrun by 30 to 40 of the al-Qaida-linked insurgents on Jan. 5, 2020, marking al-Shabab\u2019s first attack against U.S. forces in the East African country. The predawn assault triggered a lengthy firefight and daylong struggle for U.S. and Kenyan forces to search and secure the base.</p>\n\n<p>The base at Manda Bay has been used for years by the U.S. military, but it only became a full-time airfield in 2016, with increased personnel, aircraft and operations.</p>\n\n<p>The initial phase of the assault came near dawn, when 20 to 30 al-Shabab militants slipped through the forest and fired rocket-propelled grenades onto the airfield at the base. The opening rounds of grenades quickly killed a soldier in a truck and wounded another, and killed two contractors in an aircraft and wounded one other. About a mile down the road, other militants fired on Camp Simba, a section of the base where U.S. forces are stationed.</p>\n\n<p>Marines from Camp Simba initially responded to the attack site and begin to fight back against the militants, who had made it onto the airfield and into buildings. But it took all day for Kenyan and U.S. security forces to finally quash the attack, search the airfield and secure the area.</p>\n\n<p>Air Force Col. Chris Karns, spokesperson for U.S. Africa Command, said a \u201cgreat deal of rigor\u201d was put into the investigation, resulting in a number of immediate improvements. He said the goal has been to reassure the families and the American public \u201cthat we did everything possible to understand the situation and take appropriate action.\u201d</p>\n\n<p>The investigation team made \u201cfindings and recommendations that fall outside U.S. Africa Command purview and ability to effect, therefore we fully support the additional independent review directed by the Secretary of Defense,\u201d Karns said. \u201cWe are confident in the report\u2019s findings and remain committed to ensuring fixes and improvements in Kenya and across the continent.\u201d</p>\n\n<p>Kenya has been a key base for fighting al-Shabab, which is based in Somalia and is one of the world\u2019s most resilient extremist organizations. Al-Shabab has launched a number of attacks inside Kenya, including against civilian targets on buses, at schools and at shopping malls.</p>\n\n<p>Al-Shabab had been the target of a growing number of U.S. airstrikes inside Somalia during President Donald Trump\u2019s administration. But Trump late last year ordered the withdrawal of the roughly 700 American forces there, and the bulk of those troops were pulled out of the country by mid-January. According to officials, there are well below 100 U.S. troops in Somalia now.</p>\n\n<p>Austin has launched a review of America\u2019s military posture around the world.</p>\n\n<figure><a href=\"https://www.reactorreview.com/?p=28713\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<img src=\"https://i2.wp.com/www.reactorreview.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/rs336811_2805956-scr.jpg?resize=626%2C675&amp;ssl=1\" alt=\"Till Death Do Us Part: 74-Year-Long Love Affair of Queen Elizabeth and Prince Philip\">\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</a></figure>\n\n<p>by <a href=\"https://www.reactorreview.com/?author=1\" title=\"Posts by admin\">admin</a> | Apr 9, 2021 | <a href=\"https://www.reactorreview.com/?cat=8\">News</a>, <a href=\"https://www.reactorreview.com/?cat=111\">World</a></p>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://twitter.com/intent/tweet?url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.reactorreview.com%2F%3Fp%3D28713&amp;via=FelixMu28970705\" data-size=\"large\">Tweet</a></p>\n\n<p>Coming from the royal Greek and Danish families, 18-year-old Philip first caught the eye of Princess Elizabeth (at the time) in 1939, when she was just 13 years old and he was a young cadet enrolled in the Royal Naval College in Dartmouth.</p>\n\n<p>When royal family accounts tell the story of Queen Elizabeth and Prince Philip, it is often likened to a fairy-tale-like sequence of events for the couple. Philip wasn\u2019t deemed as the most ideal candidate for princess Elizabeth by her father King George VI due to his financial dependence and being a bit rough around the edges.</p>\n\n<p>Despite the obstacle, Philip was given permission to propose to Elizabeth by 1947, which happened in Scotland.

A refugee husband, I suppose\u201d.</p>\n\n<p>The couple had to see three of their children end their marriages in 1992 and the confirmation of the love affair between their first-born son Charles and Camilla Parker Bowles.

They lack respect, are deceitful and work towards sabotaging good while glorifying evil. They have become grand conmen and grandmasters in corruption be it in acquiring fictitious tenders, fraud and money laundering, open theft of public funds and a total elimination of human obstacles through planned killings.\n\nThese individuals care for nothing else but their pockets and their ambitions which must not be cutailed by anything or anyone otherwise any threat is squarely eliminated. Their presennce is embued with the aroma of evil.\n\nBut who are they? Who seeks to scare Kenyans and plunge the country into fear, chaos and calamity through their economic and political ambitions? These are William Ruto and his foot soldiers as this revelation chooses not to disgrace the title \u2018Deputy President\u2019 as there have been commendable ones before in the same positions and there will be many others later. These men have committed atrocities that have ranged from attempted economic sabotage, attempted political sabotage and even social with the attempted sparking of class wars in the country between those considered \u2018rich\u2019 and those considered \u2018poor\u2019 from an individual who falsely claims he wants peace in the country.\n\nListing them they include the likes of Rigathi Gaachagua who stole from Nyeri County as he brother slowly deteriorated and died of cancer, Farouk Kibet who is well vast with covering up tracing of Ruto in a number of gruesome murders, Mwangi Kiunjuri who instituted a well crafted maize scandal that led to the loss of billions meant for farmers, Rashid Echesa who is a political goon and has also been involved in a series of corruption scandals including the fake arms scandal that saw a Ruto aide Sgt Kenei murdered with Ruto playing the \u2018I don\u2019t know what happened\u2019 game.\n\nOscar Sudi who is adversely mentioned in the Arror Kimwarer dams scandal that led to the loss of over SH21billion, Kimani Ngunjiri who learning from his master Ruto has been implicated in a trail of land fraud and even grabbed land from an elderly woman.

This is after it dawned on them the initial June date was no longer realistic.\n\nThey cited the delay by the Nation al Assembly and the Senate to pass the bill. And now some of the BBI bill promoters are pushing for reopening of the report, a move that will definitely derail the process further. The BBI bill had earlier been tabled before county assemblies and received overwhelming support. The assemblies complied with Article 257 of the Constitution which outlines a\nroadmap of amending the Constitution through the popular initiative.\n\nUnder this law, the hands of the legislative bodies, both at county and national levels are tied. They have no power to alter or add a coma or fullstop to a bill that originates from views of the people. The county assemblies had two options: to either adopt or reject the bill submitted to them by the Independent Electoral and Boundaries Commission.\n\nThe National Assembly and the Senate had a similar role. However, even if the two Houses rejected the original BBI bill, it wouldn\u2019t stop the IEBC from going ahead with referendum plans. Kenyans will have the final say.\n\nPresident Uhuru Kenyatta and his Handshake partner Raila Odinga are the key drivers of the BBI process. However, going by latest political events, it seems one or both of them has/have changed mind. They no longer lead the BBI process with same vigour and energy they exhibited at the start of the journey.\n\nBesides their allies are now rooting for the reopening of bill and if they have eventually have their way, then the BBI bill would no longer be a popular document. Well, one of the key proposals that the MPs, who are pushing for the reopening of BBI report, are uncomfortable with is that of increasing the number of constituencies. Central Kenya is highly populated and hence it is set to receive the lion\u2019s share of the 70 additional parliamentary seats.\n\nThe BBI bill has no clause suggesting the power to create new electoral units would be taken away from IEBC. Once adopted, the commission will still exercise this power. In the event that the document is reopened, we would result in two documents, one passed by county assemblies and the amended version endorsed by two Houses of Parliament.\n\nSo which bill will be presented to Kenyans at the referendum? Further, this would give the anti BBI team more grounds to challenge the legality of the process in court. One wonders why the same proponents of the constitution amendment initiative would want to offend the same supreme law of the land they seek to make better.\n\nRemember how Raila allies repeatedly countered the narrative of cost of a referendum, arguing that Kenyans stand to gain more if BBI sailed through? What has changed? Kenyans deserve better leadership, please!\n\nKlepRUTOmania; Not a Disorder But A Habitual Willful Undertaking\n\nby admin | Apr 14, 2021 | , Politics\n\nTweet\n\nThe buck stopped at Deputy President William Ruto or so that was the never ending supposed thought. But alas the tables of urned and apart from the already existing loot from the likes of Waluke, Kihika and Murkomen, things are not all rosy for they have been exposed in several exposes that have confirmed how public money has been siphoned and directed to their pockets in well schemed and fueled scandals.\n\nFor Ruto, it was an elaborate plan that he has been using to fuel his campaign, buy and manufacture goons, fund his so-called foot soldiers and make payments for the unmentioned lot to do the \u2018dirty\u2019 work, some of whom have consumed the likes of Kenei. Jacob Juma among others, but that is besides the point. This time round the Civil Society seems to have seen the light on who Ruto really is, they have seen the light on his corrupt nature and how his expends public money that goes directly to his already fat pockets. This man Ruto has never been worn out of pocketing taxpayers money. If there was a word that could be likened to a kleptomaniac it would probably be coined as Kleprutomaniac but for this one it would be one who has an addiction for the big bucks including anything land and anything that spells billions no matter what the cost.\n\nDiscovered now to be a Saint of the devil, the Civil Society has realized that they have been backing a man who goes against their statutes as a society. Renowned joiurnalist John Allan Nyamu who for years was known for his success and in-depth and truthful investigative stories is now a part of the Civil society under Africa Uncensored but be it as it may his journalistic instinct and quest for the truth exposed Ruto\u2019s anomaly to a Civil Society that had once been veiled by Ruto to believe that he was fighting for the rights of the \u2018Wanjiku\u2019 but it was all about his political ambitions that were centred on power, dictatorship and control.\n\nOver the past Namu has revealed how DP Ruto and his office holders have strategically been involved in similar contracts for not one or two or three contracts but eight consecutive years. This is unethical and illegal in the issuing of tenders and contracts as it clearly displays biasness. This, the Civil Society has failed to justify and is now beginning to see the truth on Ruto\u2019s corrupt nature of grand theft. More so to this is the fact that his allies have been in and out of court over corruption allegations involving billions.\n\nThe Arror and Kimwarer dams construction was one lucrative project that Ruto felt he had hit the jackpot as it was an opportunity to hit his own without trace. Well placed, besides the \u2018mere\u2019 billions stolen as downplayed by Ruto, the former Cabinet Secretary made a payment of insurance at 17.5% rate instead of 1.5% inflated 17 timees more from the actual payment with his master shielding him on several occasions from the Sh21 billion scandal. Further information also revealed that Ruto had specific individuals in companies that were well place to \u2018oil his pipeline\u2019. Ever heard of Stella Nyamu? Ask Allan Namu, for she was a key informant in ensuring transactions go to the fictitious companies.\n\nSomalia political crisis deepens as MPs extend Farmaajo\u2019s term by two years\n\nSomalia\u2019s Parliament has extended its mandate and that of President Mohamed Farmaajo by two years, giving the incumbent some respite but creating a potential opposition from the international community and some aspirants.\n\nThe decision was reached on Monday after an emergency assembly of the Lower House saw some 149 MPs vote to extend their mandate with three voting against and one abstaining from the vote. The House usually has 275 MPs.\n\nPresident Farmaajo welcomed the decision, saying it will correct the incessant disagreements on the electoral model.\n\nHe said national elections lie within the jurisdiction of the Republic and are independent of the people Government of Somalia.\n\nThe president said all government agencies will carry out their mandates using diplomatic terms & principles without tolerating any external interference.\n\n\u201cThe Government shall play its key role in the implementation of the electoral law as passed by the House of the people to rightfully restore the constitutional power to the Somali people,\u201d he said.\n\nThe MPs say the two years should provide enough time for the country to be ready for universal suffrage, something it had failed to organise in four years.\n\n\u201cHis Excellency, President Mohamed Farmaajo urges the citizens to seize the historic chance to choose their destiny as the House of the People voted to return the mandate of the election to the people.\n\nIndirect election\n\n\u201cThis followed after the failure of FMS members to support the implementation of the initial Sep 17, 2020 Agreement,\u201d said a statement from Villa Somalia, Farmaajo\u2019s official residence in Mogadishu.\n\nThe decision may undercut the calls by the international community and opposition groups who had opposed the extension of the mandate and any moves that could jeopardize the implementation of an indirect election based on an agreement reached on September 17, 2020.\n\nUnder the agreement signed by President Farmaajo and leaders of five federal states; an indirect election was to be based on delegates nominated by elders in conjunction with the electoral management bodies. The delegates were to elect MPs who in turn vote for the president.\n\nBut the parties disagreed on who should be members of the electoral commission, security arrangements, and venue of the polls in some of the federal states.\n\nLast week, the parties fell out for the fourth time, failing to agree on the way forward and making no arrangements to return to the table. Opposition groups and donors demanded the resumption of talks. They didn\u2019t.\n\n\u201cFarmajo\u2019s train has arrived at the station it had been running towards. Many people who were unsure about his intention now know better,\u201d said Mr. Abdishakur Abdirahman, leader of Wadajir Party and a presidential aspirant.\n\n\u201cAnyone who provides financial, military or diplomatic support to Farmajo\u2019s unconstitutional acts becomes part of a crime against the Somali people.\u201d\n\nNo extension\n\nMr. Abdirahman and several other aspirants had formed the Council of Presidential Candidates, a caucus which has insisted on no extensions or parallel electoral programs. Last week, the group led by ex-President Sheikh Sharif Ahmed called on parties to return to the table.\n\nKenya Can No Longer Stand The Brute Actions of the British\n\nby admin | Apr 6, 2021 | Politics\n\nTweet\n\nThey have committed gruesome atrocities against our people, our forefathers, freedom fighters. They have raped,killed and maimed, arrested and whipped, innocent Kenyans whom they tortured to subdue a people and take away their livelihoods and most of all their bountiful land that they grabbed as they killed the actual African owners. These are moments that Kenyans would never choose to relive because the British were brut and brutal, they openly practiced racism and continued on a killing spree to settle their own who were streaming in the country in drones and unfortunately this has not ended.\n\nFeeling entitled to their theft, they went on their business of killing and subjecting Kenyans to slavery as they took up the lush green farms of Central and Rift Valley regions Kenyans were demeaned and demoralized by a country anchored on theft or resources and taking away the rights and privileges of Africans, particularly Kenyans\n\nWith all said and done and to this date the British are still at it, feeling entitled and behaving as bullies as they are. The recent diplomatic spat is a clear show of a country that assumes it can get away with manipulating Kenya into doing as it pleases. But times have changed and Kenya cannot allow to be tossed back and forth by colonialists who stole resources including acreages of land and now putting in restrictive measures against Kenyans flying to the United Kingdom. Ironically, Kenya has fewer Covid-19 cases yet had not put in punitive measures against the United Kingdom. With a strain that emanated from their country, their restrictions are outright punitive and unbalanced yet they want to subject Kenyans to punitive measures upon arrival in the UK.\n\nFortunately, Kenya cannot agree to be manipulated as a country and is outright outraged over UKs move which will firmly put an end to neocolonialism. This is why it is important to give the same energy you are given. Kenya will not stand down to UK discriminatory ways. Call a spade a spade\n\nForget the \u2018Hustlers\u2019, It\u2019s For Him, Himself and His; Sputnik V Is Now Ruto\u2019s Latest Money Minting Venture\n\nby admin | Apr 5, 2021 | Politics\n\nTweet\n\nHe was almost at his happy place. All plans had been well drafted and a whooping $ 6 million worth in fraudulent profit was beckoning at his doorstep. Having acquired a good deal for the importation of Sputnik V vaccine everything was up and running and would go a long way in recouping what he had lost from handouts and tokens to politicians and \u2018hustlers\u2019 that had irrevocably failed to deliver on the Tanga Tanga hype which is now his nightmare.\n\nTaking advantage of the fear that has bedeviled Kenyans who are now demanding for the vaccine. Ruto went ahead and well against the government and his own Executive to be the brand Ambassador for the Sputnik V that is not at all pocket friendly for the hustlers he \u2018claims\u2019 to be fighting for and indebted to. Accompanied by his dear wife, Rachel Ruto, Deputy President received the first dose of his imported Sputnik vaccine that cost Sh20000 which is money that he considers very affordable for the hustlers that he represents. Unconcerned and unfettered by his receiving of the vaccine, Ruto expects every hustler to,pay up for his imported Sh20000 vaccine and shun the Oxford AstraZeneca vaccine which is free.\n\nFor Ruto it was about the money and particularly fending for his unending thirst for money. Shunning a free vaccine that target Kenyans from all walks of life, Ruto who had already begun commercialization of the vaccination exercise put his financial interest ahead of the health of Kenyans. Does he expect \u2018hustlers\u2019 to start paying up Sh20000 for the vaccine using his economics of the wheelbarrow?\n\nMoreover, this particular vaccine has not even been approved by the World Health Organization neither have any trials been undertaken in the country. For him, sitting in front of the screens was not a show of confidence in being vaccinated but was a marketing stunt to create demand and increase anxiety for the people to take up the vaccine. And this has been witnessed with the haves paying up for the 100,000 doses imported by Ruto in total disregard of what had been approved by the WHO and the government and against the public good.\n\nThis is nothing to an individual who once imported maize containing aflatoxin, a cancer causing agent which saw a sharp rise of cancer cases in the country but ensured a fat wallet for him. Nothing to a man who unashamedly denies his community an opportunity to improve their standards of living through the construction of the Arror and Kimwarer dam that saw the disappearance of over Sh21 billion being downplayed like pocket change. One who cannot, has not and would not even genuinely assist even one hustler to be vaccinated with Sputnik V vaccine. This is Ruto for you, a vision of pocket enrichment and power, not for any Kenyan.", "articleBodyHtml": "<article>\n\n<figure><a href=\"https://www.reactorreview.com/?p=28952\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<img src=\"https://i0.wp.com/www.reactorreview.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/IMG_20210421_063555.jpg?resize=1080%2C592&amp;ssl=1\" alt=\"Deeply Entrenched In Crime; How William Ruto Operates\">\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</a></figure>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://twitter.com/intent/tweet?url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.reactorreview.com%2F%3Fp%3D28952&amp;via=FelixMu28970705\" data-size=\"large\">Tweet</a></p>\n\n<p>Beyond reproach, uncouth, insolent and self-centred individuals.

They have raped,killed and maimed, arrested and whipped, innocent Kenyans whom they tortured to subdue a people and take away their livelihoods and most of all their bountiful land that they grabbed as they killed the actual African owners. These are moments that Kenyans would never choose to relive because the British were brut and brutal, they openly practiced racism and continued on a killing spree to settle their own who were streaming in the country in drones and unfortunately this has not ended.</p>\n\n<p>Feeling entitled to their theft, they went on their business of killing and subjecting Kenyans to slavery as they took up the lush green farms of Central and Rift Valley regions Kenyans were demeaned and demoralized by  a country anchored on theft or resources and taking away the rights and privileges of Africans, particularly Kenyans</p>\n\n<p>With all said and done and to this date the British are still at it, feeling entitled and behaving as bullies as they are. The recent diplomatic spat is a clear show of a country that assumes it can get away with manipulating Kenya into doing as it pleases. But times have changed and Kenya cannot allow to be tossed back and forth by colonialists who stole resources including acreages of land and now putting in restrictive measures against Kenyans flying to the United Kingdom. Ironically, Kenya has fewer Covid-19 cases  yet had not put in punitive measures  against the United Kingdom. With a strain that emanated from their country, their restrictions are outright punitive and unbalanced yet they want to subject Kenyans to punitive measures upon arrival in the UK.</p>\n\n<p>Fortunately, Kenya cannot agree to be manipulated as a country and is outright outraged over UKs move which will firmly put an end to neocolonialism. This is why it is important to give the same energy you are given. Kenya will not stand down to UK discriminatory ways. Call a spade a spade</p>\n\n<figure><a href=\"https://www.reactorreview.com/?p=28519\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<img src=\"https://i0.wp.com/www.reactorreview.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/IMG_20210405_064313.jpg?resize=1080%2C675&amp;ssl=1\" alt=\"Forget the \u2018Hustlers\u2019, It\u2019s For Him, Himself and His; Sputnik V Is Now Ruto\u2019s Latest Money Minting Venture\">\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</a></figure>\n\n<h2><a href=\"https://www.reactorreview.com/?p=28519\">Forget the \u2018Hustlers\u2019, It\u2019s For Him, Himself and His; Sputnik V Is Now Ruto\u2019s Latest Money Minting Venture</a></h2>\n\n<p>by <a href=\"https://www.reactorreview.com/?author=1\" title=\"Posts by admin\">admin</a> | Apr 5, 2021 | <a href=\"https://www.reactorreview.com/?cat=101\">Politics</a></p>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://twitter.com/intent/tweet?url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.reactorreview.com%2F%3Fp%3D28519&amp;via=FelixMu28970705\" data-size=\"large\">Tweet</a></p>\n\n<p>He was almost at his happy place. All plans had been well drafted and a whooping $ 6 million worth in fraudulent profit was beckoning at his doorstep. Having acquired a good deal for the importation of Sputnik V vaccine everything was  up and running and would go a long way in recouping what he had lost from handouts and tokens to politicians and \u2018hustlers\u2019 that had irrevocably failed to deliver on the Tanga Tanga hype which is now his nightmare.</p>\n\n<p>Taking advantage of the fear that has bedeviled Kenyans who are now demanding for the vaccine. Ruto went ahead and well against the government and his own Executive to be the brand Ambassador for the  Sputnik V that is not at all pocket friendly for the hustlers he \u2018claims\u2019 to be fighting for and indebted to. Accompanied by his dear wife, Rachel Ruto, Deputy President received the first dose of his imported Sputnik vaccine that cost Sh20000 which is money that he considers very affordable for the hustlers that he represents. Unconcerned and unfettered by his receiving of the vaccine, Ruto expects every hustler to,pay up for his imported Sh20000 vaccine and shun the Oxford AstraZeneca vaccine which is free.</p>\n\n<p>For Ruto it was about the money and particularly fending for his unending thirst for money. Shunning a free vaccine that target Kenyans from all walks of life, Ruto who had already begun commercialization of the vaccination exercise put his financial interest ahead of the health of Kenyans. Does he expect \u2018hustlers\u2019 to start paying up Sh20000 for the vaccine using his economics of the wheelbarrow?</p>\n\n<p>Moreover, this particular vaccine has not even been approved by the World Health Organization neither have any trials been undertaken in the country. For him, sitting in front of the screens was not a show of confidence in being vaccinated but was a marketing stunt to create demand and increase anxiety for the people to take up the vaccine. And this has been witnessed with the haves paying up for the 100,000  doses imported by Ruto in total disregard of what had been approved by the WHO and the government and against the public good.</p>\n\n<p>This is nothing to an individual who once imported maize containing aflatoxin, a cancer causing agent which saw a sharp rise of cancer cases in the country but ensured a fat wallet for him. Nothing to a man who unashamedly denies his community an opportunity to improve their standards of living through the construction of the Arror and Kimwarer dam that saw the disappearance of over Sh21 billion being downplayed like pocket change. One who cannot, has not and would not even genuinely assist even one hustler to be vaccinated with Sputnik V vaccine. This is Ruto for you, a vision of pocket enrichment and power, not for any Kenyan.</p>\n\n</article>"},{"url": "https://www.reactorreview.com/?p=28965", "probability": 0.9886309, "headline": "Song and dance; Uhuru receives heroic welcome in Democratic Republic of Congo (DRC)", "datePublished": "2021-04-21T00:00:00", "datePublishedRaw": "Apr 21, 2021", "dateModified": "2021-04-22T07:34:35+00:00", "dateModifiedRaw": "2021-04-22T07:34:35+00:00", "author": "admin", "authorsList": ["admin"], "inLanguage": "en", "mainImage": "https://i0.wp.com/www.reactorreview.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/176145243_4549022978446524_2109400523070028448_n.jpg?fit=1200%2C794&ssl=1", "images": ["https://i0.wp.com/www.reactorreview.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/176145243_4549022978446524_2109400523070028448_n.jpg?resize=1080%2C675&ssl=1", "https://i0.wp.com/www.reactorreview.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/176145243_4549023231779832_7936740725759298752_n.jpg?resize=1080%2C671&ssl=1", "https://i2.wp.com/www.reactorreview.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/176221111_4549023428446479_4654921505436231132_n-1.jpg?resize=1080%2C736&ssl=1", "https://i0.wp.com/www.reactorreview.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/176258223_4549023151779840_1709375381362961595_n.jpg?resize=1080%2C805&ssl=1", "https://secure.gravatar.com/avatar/79818052b835414a173c0dadcc9e9f44?s=150&d=mm&r=g"], "description": "President Uhuru Kenyatta has left the country for the Democratic Republic of Congo (DRC) on President Felix Tshisekedi\u2019s invitation.

Ju\u2026", "articleBody": "Tweet\n\nPresident Uhuru Kenyatta\u2019s Jubilee has taken on Deputy President William Ruto-backed United Democratic Alliance (UDA), with a plot to terminate a pre-election agreement with the rebranded party.\n\nJubilee has insisted it signed a pre-election pact with Party for Development and Reforms (PDR), which rebranded to UDA, and is therefore considered a new entity.\n\nAnd if it goes ahead and severs ties with UDA, MPs allied to Ruto who are openly associating with the new party, citing the coalition agreement, would be exposed legally.\n\nAccording to the Political Parties Act, a party member who promotes the affairs of another outfit risks disciplinary action, punishment the President\u2019s camp would not hesitate to initiate against rebels as the relations with his deputy continue to deteriorate.\n\n\u201cIt is dishonest to say we are in the same coalition (with UDA). It is a hostile coalition. It is hostile in Parliament. It cannot be allowed to continue,\u201d Jubilee secretary-general Raphael Tuju recently submitted to the Political Parties Disputes Tribunal where he defended the party\u2019s decision to expel nominated Senator Isaac Mwaura for his association with UDA.\n\nBut Dr Ruto has dismissed such claims, insisting that UDA\u2019s agreement with Jubilee is still valid.\n\nCoalition agreement\n\n\u201cUDA and Jubilee are one. We have a coalition agreement and we have been working together. If they break Jubilee, trying to make it a tribal party, we will build UDA as the national party we had hoped Jubilee will be,\u201d Dr Ruto said last month.\n\nAnd last Thursday, the DP cautioned Jubilee has itself to blame for what he said will be an avalanche of defections to UDA. \u201cIn the event Jubilee is not available, we will have a plan B. UDA is the next best option as it is already working with Jubilee. It will become an option if Jubilee does not stop this expulsion spree.\u201d\n\nThe DP\u2019s allies, too, insist they have done nothing wrong in associating with an affiliate of Jubilee.\n\n\u201cAs far as I am concerned, I am still a Jubilee member.

It is a hostile coalition. It is hostile in Parliament. It cannot be allowed to continue,\u201d Jubilee secretary-general Raphael Tuju recently submitted to the Political Parties Disputes Tribunal where he defended the party\u2019s decision to expel nominated Senator Isaac Mwaura for his association with UDA.</p>\n\n<p>But Dr Ruto has dismissed such claims, insisting that UDA\u2019s agreement with Jubilee is still valid.</p>\n\n<p>Coalition agreement</p>\n\n<p>\u201cUDA and Jubilee are one.

If they break Jubilee, trying to make it a tribal party, we will build UDA as the national party we had hoped Jubilee will be,\u201d Dr Ruto said last month.</p>\n\n<p>And last Thursday, the DP cautioned Jubilee has itself to blame for what he said will be an avalanche of defections to UDA. \u201cIn the event Jubilee is not available, we will have a plan B.

Really, one can hardly argue with that assertion, unless one is a eunuch or is totally sexually inhibited due to any other reason.\n\nSimply, sex sells, and it sells big time! In more licentious societies particularly in the West, sex is a multi-billion dollar industry accruing from the sale of related audio-visual materials and paraphernalia. Therefore, it is a high time we stopped the pretence and discussed this issue from a human perspective.\n\nThe issue of sexual offences came up recently during the ongoing interviews for the position of the Chief Justice (CJ) by the Judicial Service Commission when Justice Said Juma Chitembwe was put to task over his freeing of Martin Charo, 24, who had been sentenced to 20 years in prison for having sex with a 13-year-old girl. He said that the child appeared \u201cwilling to have sex with the defendant\u201d.\n\nI would hate to be in Justice Chitembwe\u2019s shoes. But it takes a man of valour like Chitembwe to stand up for reason even when he is bludgeoned by popular opinion. That is really, in my view, the mark of a CJ! Now, it is one thing for an adult to take advantage of a girl below the age of legal consent.\n\nThat should be punished severely. But what do you do when two \u2018consenting\u2019 minors are caught in the act?

Really, one can hardly argue with that assertion, unless one is a eunuch or is totally sexually inhibited due to any other reason.</p>\n\n<p>Simply, sex sells, and it sells big time! In more licentious societies particularly in the West, sex is a multi-billion dollar industry accruing from the sale of related audio-visual materials and paraphernalia. Therefore, it is a high time we stopped the pretence and discussed this issue from a human perspective.</p>\n\n<p>The issue of sexual offences came up recently during the ongoing interviews for the position of the Chief Justice (CJ) by the Judicial Service Commission when Justice Said Juma Chitembwe was put to task over his freeing of Martin Charo, 24, who had been sentenced to 20 years in prison for having sex with a 13-year-old girl. He said that the child appeared \u201cwilling to have sex with the defendant\u201d.</p>\n\n<p>I would hate to be in Justice Chitembwe\u2019s shoes. But it takes a man of valour like Chitembwe to stand up for reason even when he is bludgeoned by popular opinion. That is really, in my view, the mark of a CJ! Now, it is one thing for an adult to take advantage of a girl below the age of legal consent.</p>\n\n<p>That should be punished severely. But what do you do when two \u2018consenting\u2019 minors are caught in the act? Do you jail both of them or, throw the male child under the bus while the acquiescent girl, sometimes the aggressor, goes scot-free? Truth be told, even those making some of these draconian and unrealistic laws against sexuality, were deflowered before the age of adulthood.

She said burial arrangements were underway and announced 14 days of mourning and the flying of flags at half staff. State television broadcast mournful and religious songs.\n\nMagufuli had not been seen in public since Feb. 27, sparking rumors that he had contracted COVID-19. Officials denied on March 12 that he had fallen ill and on Monday the vice president urged Tanzanians not to listen to rumors from outside the country and said it was normal for a human being to be checked for the flu or fever..\n\n\u201cDear Tanzanians, it is sad to announce that today 17 March 2021 around 6 p.m. we lost our brave leader, President John Magufuli who died from heart disease at Mzena hospital in Dar es Salaam where he was getting treatment,\u201d the vice president said on state broadcaster TBC.\n\nHe was Tanzania\u2019s first president to die while in office.\n\nPrime Minister Kassim Majaliwa said on Friday that he had spoken to Magufuli, and blamed the narrative of the president\u2019s ailment on some \u201chateful\u201d Tanzanians living abroad.\n\nTundu Lissu, Magufuli\u2019s main rival in the October election when the president won a second five-year term, had suggested Tanzania\u2019s leader had been flown to Kenya for treatment for COVID-19 and then moved to India in a coma.\n\nAfter the death was announced, opposition leader Zitto Kabwe said he had spoken to Vice President Hassan to offer condolences for Magufuli\u2019s death. \u201cThe nation will remember him for his contribution to the development of our country,\u201d Kabwe said in a statement published on Twitter.\n\nHASSAN WOULD BE FIRST FEMALE PRESIDENT\n\nAccording to Tanzania\u2019s Constitution, Vice President Hassan, 61, should assume the presidency for the remainder of the five-year term that Magufuli began serving last year after winning a second term. She would be the East African nation\u2019s first female president.\n\nBorn in the semi-autonomous archipelago of Zanzibar, Hassan studied economics in Britain, worked for the U.N.\u2019s World Food Programme and then held various government posts prior to becoming Tanzania\u2019s first female vice president in 2015.\n\nHassan said Magufuli was admitted on March 6 to Jakaya Kikwete Cardiac Institute for heart problems and discharged the next day. A week later he felt bad and was rushed to Mzena hospital where he was getting treatment under the supervision of doctors from the cardiac institute, she said.\n\nIn Dar es Salaam, the country\u2019s commercial capital with more than two million residents, the streets were empty when news of Magufuli\u2019s death was announced just before midnight.\n\n\u201cI remember him since his days when he was minister of works and then he became president, a president who worked hard that even if you didn\u2019t agree with him it got to a point that you agreed with him. I appreciated him, he did a really good job,\u201d one man, Patrice Tarimo, said in Dar es Salaam after hearing the news.\n\n\u2018THE BULLDOZER\u2019\n\nNicknamed \u201cThe Bulldozer\u201d because of his reputation for pushing through policies despite opposition, Magufuli frustrated the World Health Organization (WHO) during the pandemic by playing down the threat from COVID-19, saying god and remedies such as steam inhalation would protect Tanzanians.\n\nThe former chemistry teacher had mocked coronavirus tests, denounced vaccines as part of a Western conspiracy to take Africa\u2019s wealth, and opposed mask-wearing and social distancing.\n\nTanzania stopped reporting coronavirus data in May last year when it had reported 509 cases and 21 deaths, according to the WHO, which has urged the government to be more transparent.\n\nHe was re-elected for a second term in 2020, winning 84% of the vote in an election the opposition said was marred by irregularities and whose results it rejected.\n\n\u2018Unbowed\u2019: Uhuru lauds Kenyans\u2019 resilience in face of Covid, bans Political rallies\n\nby admin | Mar 12, 2021 | Breaking News\n\nTweet\n\nKenya remains unbowed despite the crisis the coronavirus pandemic has brought in the last year.\n\nThese are the words of President Uhuru Kenyatta during his national address on Friday.\n\n\u201cAs much as our nation was wounded, it remains unbowed,\u201d he said.\n\n\u201cInstead of giving in to the shock of lockdowns, businesses have reengineered their business models, responding to shocks.\u201d\n\nUhuru said the country\u2019s approach has been a mixed bag of fortunes.\n\nHe cited the cessation of movement which had heavy costs on the economy but saved lives.\n\n\u201cWe chose life over the economy,\u201d he said.\n\n\u201cYou can always revive an economy, but you can\u2019t revive a lost life.\u201d\n\nAll public gatherings have been prohibited for 30 days from midnight on Friday.\n\nUhuru said this will be extended if infections don\u2019t go down.\n\n\u201cThis should be followed regardless of the political or social standing,\u201d he said.\n\nBurials should be conducted within 72 hours of death and gatherings will be limited to family members, capped at 100 persons.\n\nThe number also applies to weddings.\n\nMore follows\u2026\n\nLord, We Give You President Magufuli, And Ask That You May Restore His Health\n\nTweet\n\nA leader who, for over a year declared his country to be free from COVID-19 and said prayers helped to defeat the virus is now in need of the prayers he vouched for. Alongside this, Magufuli is in the hands of foreign and Tanzanian doctors as he said no Kenyan doctor should touch him. He has come to Kenya to be saved from COVID-19, as the man is said to have tested positive for the virus and is in critical condition at the Nairobi hospital in Nairobi, Kenya.\n\nMany Tanzanians have suffered because of this ignorance and defiance to fight the virus as Kenya, Rwanda and other neighbouring countries. And sadly many more deaths are being recorded silently as the country has done absolutely nothing to fight the pandemic.\n\nFor a man like Nasa Kiwanga who lost his daughter, Tully, to COVID-19 earlier this month in Tanzania\u2019s capital, Dodoma, he has little to look forward to in a country ravaged by the COVID-19 pandemic with no preventive measures.\n\nResidents and doctors pointed to a growing number of illnesses and deaths while opposition politicians said government\u2019s stance is endangering lives, but the man President Magufuli was adamant.\n\nAs fate would have it, it is only recently that Magufuli on a Sunday church mass in the capital Dodoma, urged citizens to take precautions including traditional remedies and wear face masks \u2013 but only locally made ones. According to a source witness, Magufuli said to them,\n\n\u201cWe should take health precautions as it was announced. He said we should put God first, while searching for an alternative, in line with steam inhalation. He said that his own children got sick, some of his little ones got sick and they recovered. It\u2019s all about putting God first, he said, adding that steam inhalation should not be ignored\u201d.\n\nWith a likelihood of fear growing in him, Magufuli again reiterated the same and called on citizens for three days of prayer to defeat unnamed respiratory diseases. This was amid warnings from the Catholic church, the U.S. embassy and others that Tanzania is seeing a deadly resurgence in coronavirus infections.\n\nAnd now, Tanzanian President Magufuli needs our prayers to be able to fight the dreaded virus. Tanzanian and Kenyan prayer warriors must seek the face of God to heal President Magufuli who is in critical condition.\n\nWith many Tanzanians finding their President\u2019s remarks unsettling many have taken up responsibility to protect themselves but this is not enough as it has to be a united effort as a country.\n\nAs we pray for Magufulis\u2019s recovery Tanzanians must start protecting themselves and the Tanzanian government must take up responsibility.\n\nby admin | Mar 10, 2021 | Breaking News\n\nTweet\n\nIntense speculation has been generated online over the whereabouts of the Tanzanian president John Magufuli, with many pointing a finger to a hospital in the Kenyan capital Nairobi.\n\nThose asking questions include the leader of the opposition Tundu Lissu, who said the matter was, \u201ca matter of grave public concern\u201d in a tweet.\n\nContacted by The Africa Report, Lissu would neither confirm nor deny the diagnosis.\n\n#COVID19 #magufuli https://t.co/w543mgppAZ\n\n\u2014 Prof Nic Cheeseman (@Fromagehomme) March 9, 2021\n\nKenya\u2019s local newspaper has said that an African leader had been admitted to a Nairobi hospital, without confirming their name.\n\nOther sources have indicated that Magufuli is in a Dar-es-Salaam hospital, suffering from Covid-19-like symptoms.\n\nCriticism of Magufuli\u2019s handling of the Covid-19 pandemic dates back to last year, when he ordered a plane-load of Madagascar\u2019s unproven herbal potion, refused to talk to regional leaders about the spread of the virus, and claimed that three days of national prayer would be sufficient to tackle the coronavirus outbreak in the country.\n\nDoctors against denialism\n\nMore recently he has been criticized by doctors in Tanzania who have been pleading for greater attention.\n\nSpeaking anonymously, one doctor told The Africa Report: \u201cWe are pressured by the authorities not to attend to people who have coronavirus symptoms rather than treating them for pneumonia and lung infections. As doctors, we are in danger because we are not even getting personal protective equipment. The government has to change its perception and take this pandemic seriously.\u201d\n\nThe President\u2019s well-being is a matter of grave public concern. We\u2019re informed when Kikwete had prostate surgery. We\u2019re told when Mkapa went for hip replacement. We\u2019re not kept in the dark when Mwalimu fought leukemia. What\u2019s it with Magufuli that we don\u2019t deserve to know?\n\n\u2014 Tundu Antiphas Lissu (@TunduALissu) March 9, 2021\n\nChange of heart?\n\nBut the mindset has been changing at the top of the regime, as the virus has taken its toll on top-ranking Tanzanian officials.\n\nThose who have died include: chief secretary to State House John Kijazi, former deputy finance minister Gregory Teu, former governor of Bank of Tanzania Benno Ndulu, and first vice-president of Zanzibar Maalim Seif Sharrif Hamad, whose party ACT Wazalendo confirmed he had tested positive for Covid-19 just before his death.\n\n\u201cA number of Tanzanians traveling to neighboring countries and beyond have tested positive for COVID-19. This underscores the need for Tanzania to take robust action both to safeguard their own people and protect populations in these countries and beyond,\u201d warned Dr. Tedros\n\nThe WHO chief added that \u201cThis situation remains very concerning.

Alongside this, Magufuli is in the hands of foreign and Tanzanian doctors as he said no Kenyan doctor should touch him. He has come to Kenya to be saved from COVID-19, as the man is said to have tested positive for the virus and is in critical condition at the Nairobi hospital in Nairobi, Kenya.</p>\n\n<p>Many Tanzanians have suffered because of this ignorance and defiance to fight the virus as Kenya, Rwanda and other neighbouring countries. And sadly many more deaths are being recorded silently as the country has done absolutely nothing to fight the pandemic.</p>\n\n<p>For a man like Nasa Kiwanga who lost his daughter, Tully, to COVID-19 earlier this month in Tanzania\u2019s capital, Dodoma, he has little to look forward to in a country ravaged by the COVID-19 pandemic with no preventive measures.</p>\n\n<p>Residents and doctors pointed to a growing number of illnesses and deaths while opposition politicians said government\u2019s stance is endangering lives, but the man President Magufuli was adamant.</p>\n\n<p>As fate would have it, it is only recently that Magufuli on a Sunday church mass in the capital Dodoma, urged citizens to take precautions including traditional remedies and wear face masks \u2013 but only locally made ones. According to a source witness, Magufuli said to them,</p>\n\n<p>\u201cWe should take health precautions as it was announced. He said we should put God first, while searching for an alternative, in line with steam inhalation. He said that his own children got sick, some of his little ones got sick and they recovered. It\u2019s all about putting God first, he said, adding that steam inhalation should not be ignored\u201d.</p>\n\n<p>With a likelihood of fear growing in him, Magufuli again reiterated the same and called on citizens for three days of prayer to defeat unnamed respiratory diseases. This was amid warnings from the Catholic church, the U.S. embassy and others that Tanzania is seeing a deadly resurgence in coronavirus infections.</p>\n\n<p>And now, Tanzanian President Magufuli needs our prayers to be able to fight the dreaded virus. Tanzanian and Kenyan prayer warriors must seek the face of God to heal President Magufuli who is in critical condition.</p>\n\n<p>With many Tanzanians finding their President\u2019s remarks unsettling many have taken up responsibility to protect themselves but this is not enough as it has to be a united effort as a country.</p>\n\n<p>As we pray for Magufulis\u2019s recovery Tanzanians must start protecting themselves and the Tanzanian government must take up responsibility.</p>\n\n<figure><a href=\"https://www.reactorreview.com/?p=27925\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<img src=\"https://i2.wp.com/www.reactorreview.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/000_1wu6ca.jpg?resize=1024%2C675&amp;ssl=1\" alt=\"BREAKING NEWS!

The world health body estimates 4 to 5 of birth defects are caused by exposure to a teratogen.\n\nThe UoN researchers say this is the first such study in the country and an indicator of what may be happening in other regions similar to Kiambu.\n\nIn February, Adana AM Llanos of Rutgers University, USA, presented compelling data in Nairobi, showing several popular hormone-based skincare and hair products mainly targeting Africans may be leading to abnormalities.\n\nThese abnormalities are largely blamed on what are called endocrine-disrupting chemicals or EDCs that mimic, block, or interfere with hormones in the body.\n\n\u201cWhen a pregnant woman is exposed, EDCs can affect the health of her child and eventual grandchildren,\u201d says Dr. Pauliina Damdimopoulou, of the Karolinska Institute in Stockholm, Sweden.\n\nDr Damdimopoulou said this last week, at the launch of a new global report \u2013 \u2018Plastic EDCs and Health\u2019 \u2013 she has co-authored for the International Pollutants Elimination Network \u2013 IPEN.\n\nThe report shows for the first time a direct link between the everyday use of plastics and the development of cancers and impairments of developing fetuses and children.\n\nPlastics, the report says, contain many harmful chemicals, (EDCs) that may leach from containers into the environment and now widely found in foods, water, pesticides, and cosmetics.\n\n\u201cSuch chemicals once in the body of a pregnant woman may also transfer to a fetus or infant via placental transfer or through breast milk,\u201d said the report.\n\nDirect effects of EDCs, Dr Damdimopoulou said, have been observed in a general drop in the quantity and quality of human sperms and ova (eggs) across the world.\n\n\u201cThe number of men presenting with the inability to produce sperms almost doubled within five years,\u201d said Dennis Chalo, a researcher at the Kenya Medical Research Institute.\n\nChalo was presenting data from the University of Nairobi\u2019s specialist semen analysis laboratory at a scientific conference in February.\n\nLikely causes\n\nThese problems have also been blamed on environmental pollution, infections and disease, use of various medications, hard drugs, alcohol and tobacco, obesity and farm chemicals.\n\nIn Kiambu as well as in another study at Kenyatta National Hospital (KNH), doctors reported worryingly high rates of deformed legs at birth.\n\nIn the two studies, the incidence of children with club foot was the most common deformity of the skeletal system.\n\n\u201cAmong the infants with musculoskeletal malformations, club foot was the most common,\u201d said a team from the University of Nairobi that had assessed child deformities at KNH.\n\nClubfoot is an abnormality in which the foot points downward and inward and is known to occur twice as often in males than in females.\n\nClub foot and conditions where one limb is shorter than the other were common in both the Kiambu and KNH studies.\n\nBoth studies indicate abnormally high rates of birth defects in the country. \u201cThe prevalence of birth defects at KNH is 19.4 percent. This is very high compared to the global prevalence of 3 to 7 percent,\u201d said the authors.\n\nAbout eight percent of the defects in KNH involved the genital organs. The team is recommending ultrasound for all pregnant women for early detection of fetal defects and where necessary pregnancy termination.\n\nFireworks as Senators go ham on one another over SONKO\u2019s impeachment ahead of Tuesday debate\n\nby admin | Dec 5, 2020 | Health, News\n\nTweet\n\nThe acrimonious removal of Mike Sonko as Nairobi Governor, on Thursday, has lit fireworks in the Senate ahead of Tuesday\u2019s debate, where the Senate is expected to endorse or reject the impeachment.\n\nSenators have stirred up debate on Twitter ahead of Tuesday\u2019s special sitting to decide on the mode of prosecuting Nairobi Governor Mike Sonko\u2019s impeachment.\n\nThe lawmakers are engrossed in bitter exchanges over Sonko\u2019s removal in what appears to have split the legislators along the pro and anti-handshake axis.\n\nSpeaker Kenneth Lusaka is set to gazette a special sitting of the members on Tuesday to consider the flamboyant county chief\u2019s impeachment after he received a notification from Nairobi speaker Benson Mutura on the Assembly\u2019s resolution to remove the governor.\n\nEither Majority leader Samuel Poghisio or his Minority counterpart James Orengo is expected to petition the speaker, with the support of at least 15 senators, to gazette the special sitting.\n\nThe lawmakers who went on Christmas and New Year Holidays are expected to resume for the fourth session on February 9, 2021.\n\nThe County Government Act requires the speaker to communicate a resolution from the county assembly to the senators within seven days of receipt of the notification.\n\nSenators Kipchumba Murkomen (Elgeyo Marakwet), Mutula Kilonzo Jr (Makueni), Johnson Sakaja (Nairobi), and Ledama Ole Kina (Narok) have stimulated the debate ahead of the high-stake sitting.\n\nMurkomen ignited the argument with a tweet directed at Minority leader James Orengo and Mutula, who is the Minority Chief Whip.\n\n\u201cGovernor Sonko impeachment mirrors (ex-Kiambu Governor) [Ferdinand] Waititu\u2019s. It is state-sponsored,\u201d he posted.\n\nHe claimed that the county assembly did meet the two-thirds threshold to impeach the governor, adding that \u201cfraudulent\u201d figures were announced on the floor.\n\nSonko was impeached on Thursday after 88 MCAs voted in favor of the ouster motion. Only two of the 90 ward representatives who logged into the voting system, voted against the motion.\n\nHowever, Sonko and MCAs allied to him cried foul saying the threshold was not met as many were in Kwale with the governor.\n\n\u201cImpeachment is procured by force. Luckily Sonko has documented evidence well but doesn\u2019t rely on Senate; Orengo and Mutula with a call from above can do anything,\u201d Murkomen asserted.\n\nMutula reacted almost immediately, terming Murkomen a siren.\n\n\u201cMutula and Orengo again. You have become a siren,\u201d Mutula hit back.\n\nTo which, Murkomen responded, \u201cYou are right bro. I want to be the siren of truth. The siren of fairness. The siren of justice.\u201d\n\nAt this point, Sakaja came in and attempted to cool down his colleagues from what was fast degenerating into a nasty exchange.\n\n\u201cWacheni\u201d [stop it],\u201d Sakaja told them.\n\nMutula then asked the former TNA chairman to \u2018tell your friend not to drag my name into his tweets. Nimetulia kwa tent yangu (I\u2019m minding my own business).\u2019\n\nLedama also waded into Sonko ouster and questioned the motive of removing and \u201charassing\u201d the governor.\n\n\u201cWhy now? Let Mike Sonko be free to carry out his constitutional mandate! It is wrong to harass an elected leader when he questions the legality of any action,\u201d\n\nKericho Senator Aaron Cheruiyot posted, \u201cThe numbers game begins. Sonko has shown us videos of his 57 MCAs. The speaker says 88 voted in support. From the Waititu experience, Mike Sonko should seek justice in courts. If it gets to the floor of the senate\u2026. Shamba la Wanyama.\u201d\n\nAt Tuesday\u2019s sitting, the senators will decide on whether Sonko\u2019s case will be prosecuted before the plenary or a special committee formed to investigate the allegations leveled against him.\n\nSection 33 of the County Governments Act states that the Senate, by resolution, may appoint a special committee comprising 11 members to investigate the matter. At this point, the committee may invite the governor and the county assembly to argue cases.\n\n\u201cA special committee appointed to investigate the matter and report to the Senate within 10 days on whether it finds the particulars of the allegations against the Governor to have been substantiated,\u201d the Act states\n\nIn this case, if at least six of the 11 members of the committee rejected all the grounds for impeaching the governor, the impeachment will flop and the governor resumes his duties.\n\nCelebrations for Cannabis farmers as U.N. Reclassifies Cannabis as a Less Dangerous Drug\n\nby admin | Dec 4, 2020 | Health\n\nA United Nations agency has voted to remove cannabis from the list of the world\u2019s most dangerous drugs.\n\nThe United Nations Commission on Narcotic Drugs on Wednesday accepted a World Health Organisation (WHO) recommendation to remove cannabis and cannabis resin from Schedule IV of the 1961 Single Convention on Narcotic Drugs.\n\nIn a vote that Kenya opposed, the commission members voted 27-25 to remove cannabis from Schedule IV of the 1961 Single Convention on Narcotic Drugs, which allows national bans for drugs with, particularly dangerous properties. Only Ukraine abstained from voting.\n\n\u201cThis formal, and long overdue recognition of the medical use of cannabis (including in herbal form) should facilitate the much-needed medical provision and further research,\u201d the UN agency\u2019s statement said.\n\nOther nations that voted with Kenya are Nigeria, Japan, Russia, Togo, Egypt, China, Cuba, Afghanistan, Algeria, Angola, Bahrain Burkina Faso, Cote d\u2019Ivoire, Iraq, and Libya.\n\nAmong African countries, only South Africa and Morocco voted for the removal of cannabis from Schedule IV.\n\nOther countries that voted Yes are Jamaica, Mexico, Canada, Germany, France, Colombia, United Kingdom, Thailand, Australia, Spain, Switzerland, Poland, Croatia among others.\n\nThe schedules of the international drug-control conventions categorize drugs, considering their medical utility versus the possible harm they could cause.\n\nSchedule I, which includes fentanyl, requires the highest levels of international control.\n\nOther drugs on Schedule I are cocaine, heroin, morphine, methadone, opium, and oxycodone, the opiate painkiller sold as OxyContin.\n\n\u201cDecades of efforts have been necessary to remove cannabis from Schedule IV, with implications that will slowly but surely be seen over the next decades,\u201d the statement read.\n\nExperts said taking cannabis off the stringent schedule could lead to the relaxing of international controls on medical marijuana.\n\nThe cannabis recommendations were first revealed by WHO in January 2019 as part of a complex package of six cannabis-related proposals.\n\nAnalyzing implications\n\nMember states took almost two years to analyze the implications of accepting or rejecting the proposals.\n\nCurrently, medical cannabis programs have been adopted in more than 50 countries. Uruguay, Canada, and 15 states in the United States have legalized the recreational use of cannabis. Mexico and Luxembourg have taken this path as well.\n\nIn the US and Canada, cannabis is used for treating chronic pain, insomnia, depression, post-traumatic stress disorder, anxiety, reducing cancer pain, and that of multiple sclerosis.\n\nCommercially, hemp (a variety of cannabis) is used in making paper, textiles, biodegradable plastics, insulation, clothing, paint, food, biofuel, and animal feed.\n\nAccording to Visual Capitalist, an online site focusing on business and investment, cannabis (marijuana) is the most lucrative cash crop globally.\n\nFirst Lady: Together we can wipe out killer virus\n\nby admin | Dec 2, 2020 | Health\n\nTweet\n\nKenyans yesterday joined the rest of the world in commemorating World Aids Day with calls on stakeholders to step up efforts aimed at lowering infections in the country.\n\nThis year\u2019s event was held in Kajiado where the local county government unveiled an ambitious plan to end mother-to-child transmission of HIV and syphilis by the year 2024.\n\nThe plan supported by First Lady Margaret Kenyatta\u2019s Beyond Zero will enable Kajiado county to mobilize resources and implement programs aimed at ending the two diseases.\n\nKajiado county has an HIV prevalence of 3.4 percent with more women infected at 4.5 percent) compared to males at 2.3 percent carrying a disease burden of slightly over 30,000 people living with the virus.\n\nIn her recorded message, First Lady Margaret Kenyatta rallied stakeholders to ramp up efforts to end HIV in the country by investing in programs that will help guard vulnerable citizens against the virus.\n\n\u201cThere is a critical need for increased awareness and resources for prevention and treatment of HIV especially amongst our youth, and more work to protect people living with Aids from stigma and discrimination.\n\n\u201cI strongly advocate for zero new infections and zero mother-to-child transmission of HIV.\n\nI continue to encourage mothers to attend at least four antenatal checks where they can receive free testing,\u201d the First Lady said.\n\nIn a speech read by CAS Dr. Mercy Mwangangi, Health CS Mutahi Kagwe said Kenya will defeat HIV through a multi-pronged approach that covers increased awareness, action, and resources.\n\nKagwe applauded Beyond Zero for its growing investment in the country\u2019s health sector saying in the First Lady\u2019s Beyond Zero initiative saying the initiative had catalyzed the improvement in the provision of health services across the country.\n\n\u201cHer (First Lady Margaret Kenyatta) consistent support for the Government\u2019s Linda Mama Programme under the Universal Healthcare Scheme has led to many mothers delivering in medical facilities assisted by professionals,\u201d said Kagwe.\n\nby admin | Dec 2, 2020 | , Health\n\nTweet\n\nA strawberry-flavored tablet for children living with HIV will be rolled out in African countries in 2021, the first generic pediatric version of a key anti-retroviral available even for babies, aid agencies said on Tuesday, World AIDS Day.\n\nSome 1.7 million children worldwide live with HIV, but only half receive any treatment \u2014 often hard to administer due to the bitter taste or incorrectly dosed by crushing adult pills, the global health agency UNITAID said. Some 100,000 children die from AIDS-related illnesses annually.\n\n\u201cFor many of those children, the HIV virus is not suppressed due in part to lack of availability of effective drugs that are palatable and properly adapted for them,\u201d UNITAID spokesman Herve Verhoosel told a Geneva news briefing.\n\nUNITAID and the Clinton Health Access Initiative have reached a pricing agreement with the generic drugmakers Viatris and Macleods for the dispersible pediatric formulation of dolutegravir, a statement said.\n\nThe first-line HIV treatment is recommended by the World Health Organization (WHO) from the age of four weeks and three kilograms, but it had been out of reach for babies because of the lack of appropriate formulations.\n\nThe estimated cost for combination therapy will now be some $120 US for a child\u2019s annual treatment, against $480 currently, UNITAID said.\n\nBenin, Kenya, Malawi, Nigeria, Uganda, and Zimbabwe are due to receive the first tablets in the first half of 2021, Verhoosel said.\n\nSelf-test introduced\n\nThe Public Health Agency of Canada said this year that the COVID-19 pandemic has heightened challenges for people living with HIV and those who are most at risk for contracting the infection.\n\n\u201cFor many, accessing culturally safe and timely HIV prevention, testing, treatment, and care is more difficult than before,\u201d the agency said in a statement on Tuesday.\n\nThe federal government recently authorized the first HIV self-test kit in Canada.

The world health body estimates 4 to 5 of birth defects are caused by exposure to a teratogen.</p>\n\n<p>The UoN researchers say this is the first such study in the country and an indicator of what may be happening in other regions similar to Kiambu.</p>\n\n<p>In February, Adana AM Llanos of Rutgers University, USA, presented compelling data in Nairobi, showing several popular hormone-based skincare and hair products mainly targeting Africans may be leading to abnormalities.</p>\n\n<p>These abnormalities are largely blamed on what are called endocrine-disrupting chemicals or EDCs that mimic, block, or interfere with hormones in the body.</p>\n\n<p>\u201cWhen a pregnant woman is exposed, EDCs can affect the health of her child and eventual grandchildren,\u201d says Dr. Pauliina Damdimopoulou, of the Karolinska Institute in Stockholm, Sweden.</p>\n\n<p>Dr Damdimopoulou said this last week, at the launch of a new global report \u2013 \u2018Plastic EDCs and Health\u2019 \u2013 she has co-authored for the International Pollutants Elimination Network \u2013 IPEN.</p>\n\n<p>The report shows for the first time a direct link between the everyday use of plastics and the development of cancers and impairments of developing fetuses and children.</p>\n\n<p>Plastics, the report says, contain many harmful chemicals, (EDCs) that may leach from containers into the environment and now widely found in foods, water, pesticides, and cosmetics.</p>\n\n<p>\u201cSuch chemicals once in the body of a pregnant woman may also transfer to a fetus or infant via placental transfer or through breast milk,\u201d said the report.</p>\n\n<p>Direct effects of EDCs, Dr Damdimopoulou said, have been observed in a general drop in the quantity and quality of human sperms and ova (eggs) across the world.</p>\n\n<p>\u201cThe number of men presenting with the inability to produce sperms almost doubled within five years,\u201d said Dennis Chalo, a researcher at the Kenya Medical Research Institute.</p>\n\n<p>Chalo was presenting data from the University of Nairobi\u2019s specialist semen analysis laboratory at a scientific conference in February.</p>\n\n<p>Likely causes</p>\n\n<p>These problems have also been blamed on environmental pollution, infections and disease, use of various medications, hard drugs, alcohol and tobacco, obesity and farm chemicals.</p>\n\n<p>In Kiambu as well as in another study at Kenyatta National Hospital (KNH), doctors reported worryingly high rates of deformed legs at birth.</p>\n\n<p>In the two studies, the incidence of children with club foot was the most common deformity of the skeletal system.</p>\n\n<p>\u201cAmong the infants with musculoskeletal malformations, club foot was the most common,\u201d said a team from the University of Nairobi that had assessed child deformities at KNH.</p>\n\n<p>Clubfoot is an abnormality in which the foot points downward and inward and is known to occur twice as often in males than in females.</p>\n\n<p>Club foot and conditions where one limb is shorter than the other were common in both the Kiambu and KNH studies.</p>\n\n<p>Both studies indicate abnormally high rates of birth defects in the country. \u201cThe prevalence of birth defects at KNH is 19.4 percent. This is very high compared to the global prevalence of 3 to 7 percent,\u201d said the authors.</p>\n\n<p>About eight percent of the defects in KNH involved the genital organs. The team is recommending ultrasound for all pregnant women for early detection of fetal defects and where necessary pregnancy termination.</p>\n\n<figure><a href=\"https://www.reactorreview.com/?p=24308\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<img src=\"https://i2.wp.com/www.reactorreview.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/unnamed-14.jpg?resize=1080%2C675&amp;ssl=1\" alt=\"Fireworks as Senators go ham on one another over SONKO\u2019s impeachment ahead of Tuesday debate\">\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</a></figure>\n\n<h2><a href=\"https://www.reactorreview.com/?p=24308\">Fireworks as Senators go ham on one another over SONKO\u2019s impeachment ahead of Tuesday debate</a></h2>\n\n<p>by <a href=\"https://www.reactorreview.com/?author=1\" title=\"Posts by admin\">admin</a> | Dec 5, 2020 | <a href=\"https://www.reactorreview.com/?cat=119\">Health</a>, <a href=\"https://www.reactorreview.com/?cat=8\">News</a></p>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://twitter.com/intent/tweet?url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.reactorreview.com%2F%3Fp%3D24308&amp;via=FelixMu28970705\" data-size=\"large\">Tweet</a></p>\n\n<p>The acrimonious removal of Mike Sonko as Nairobi Governor, on Thursday, has lit fireworks in the Senate ahead of Tuesday\u2019s debate, where the Senate is expected to endorse or reject the impeachment.</p>\n\n<p>Senators have stirred up debate on Twitter ahead of Tuesday\u2019s special sitting to decide on the mode of prosecuting Nairobi Governor Mike Sonko\u2019s impeachment.</p>\n\n<p>The lawmakers are engrossed in bitter exchanges over Sonko\u2019s removal in what appears to have split the legislators along the pro and anti-handshake axis.</p>\n\n<p>Speaker Kenneth Lusaka is set to gazette a special sitting of the members on Tuesday to consider the flamboyant county chief\u2019s impeachment after he received a notification from Nairobi speaker Benson Mutura on the Assembly\u2019s resolution to remove the governor.</p>\n\n<p>Either Majority leader Samuel Poghisio or his Minority counterpart James Orengo is expected to petition the speaker, with the support of at least 15 senators, to gazette the special sitting.</p>\n\n<p>The lawmakers who went on Christmas and New Year Holidays are expected to resume for the fourth session on February 9, 2021.</p>\n\n<p>The County Government Act requires the speaker to communicate a resolution from the county assembly to the senators within seven days of receipt of the notification.</p>\n\n<p>Senators Kipchumba Murkomen (Elgeyo Marakwet), Mutula Kilonzo Jr (Makueni), Johnson Sakaja (Nairobi), and Ledama Ole Kina (Narok) have stimulated the debate ahead of the high-stake sitting.</p>\n\n<p>Murkomen ignited the argument with a tweet directed at Minority leader James Orengo and Mutula, who is the Minority Chief Whip.</p>\n\n<p>\u201cGovernor Sonko impeachment mirrors (ex-Kiambu Governor) [Ferdinand] Waititu\u2019s. It is state-sponsored,\u201d he posted.</p>\n\n<p>He claimed that the county assembly did meet the two-thirds threshold to impeach the governor, adding that \u201cfraudulent\u201d figures were announced on the floor.</p>\n\n<p>Sonko was impeached on Thursday after 88 MCAs voted in favor of the ouster motion. Only two of the 90 ward representatives who logged into the voting system, voted against the motion.</p>\n\n<p>However, Sonko and MCAs allied to him cried foul saying the threshold was not met as many were in Kwale with the governor.</p>\n\n<p>\u201cImpeachment is procured by force. Luckily Sonko has documented evidence well but doesn\u2019t rely on Senate; Orengo and Mutula with a call from above can do anything,\u201d Murkomen asserted.</p>\n\n<p>Mutula reacted almost immediately, terming Murkomen a siren.</p>\n\n<p>\u201cMutula and Orengo again. You have become a siren,\u201d Mutula hit back.</p>\n\n<p>To which, Murkomen responded, \u201cYou are right bro. I want to be the siren of truth. The siren of fairness. The siren of justice.\u201d</p>\n\n<p>At this point, Sakaja came in and attempted to cool down his colleagues from what was fast degenerating into a nasty exchange.</p>\n\n<p>\u201cWacheni\u201d [stop it],\u201d Sakaja told them.</p>\n\n<p>Mutula then asked the former TNA chairman to \u2018tell your friend not to drag my name into his tweets. Nimetulia kwa tent yangu (I\u2019m minding my own business).\u2019</p>\n\n<p>Ledama also waded into Sonko ouster and questioned the motive of removing and \u201charassing\u201d the governor.</p>\n\n<p>\u201cWhy now? Let Mike Sonko be free to carry out his constitutional mandate! It is wrong to harass an elected leader when he questions the legality of any action,\u201d</p>\n\n<p>Kericho Senator Aaron Cheruiyot posted, \u201cThe numbers game begins. Sonko has shown us videos of his 57 MCAs. The speaker says 88 voted in support. From the Waititu experience, Mike Sonko should seek justice in courts. If it gets to the floor of the senate\u2026. Shamba la Wanyama.\u201d</p>\n\n<p>At Tuesday\u2019s sitting, the senators will decide on whether Sonko\u2019s case will be prosecuted before the plenary or a special committee formed to investigate the allegations leveled against him.</p>\n\n<p>Section 33 of the County Governments Act states that the Senate, by resolution, may appoint a special committee comprising 11 members to investigate the matter. At this point, the committee may invite the governor and the county assembly to argue cases.</p>\n\n<p>\u201cA special committee appointed to investigate the matter and report to the Senate within 10 days on whether it finds the particulars of the allegations against the Governor to have been substantiated,\u201d the Act states</p>\n\n<p>In this case, if at least six of the 11 members of the committee rejected all the grounds for impeaching the governor, the impeachment will flop and the governor resumes his duties.</p>\n\n<figure><a href=\"https://www.reactorreview.com/?p=24247\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<img src=\"https://i0.wp.com/www.reactorreview.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/Cannabis.png?resize=1080%2C675&amp;ssl=1\" alt=\"Celebrations for Cannabis farmers as U.N.

Only Ukraine abstained from voting.</p>\n\n<p>\u201cThis formal, and long overdue recognition of the medical use of cannabis (including in herbal form) should facilitate the much-needed medical provision and further research,\u201d the UN agency\u2019s statement said.</p>\n\n<p>Other nations that voted with Kenya are Nigeria, Japan, Russia, Togo, Egypt, China, Cuba, Afghanistan, Algeria, Angola, Bahrain Burkina Faso, Cote d\u2019Ivoire, Iraq, and Libya.</p>\n\n<p>Among African countries, only South Africa and Morocco voted for the removal of cannabis from Schedule IV.</p>\n\n<p>Other countries that voted Yes are Jamaica, Mexico, Canada, Germany, France, Colombia, United Kingdom, Thailand, Australia, Spain, Switzerland, Poland, Croatia among others.</p>\n\n<p>The schedules of the international drug-control conventions categorize drugs, considering their medical utility versus the possible harm they could cause.</p>\n\n<p>Schedule I, which includes fentanyl, requires the highest levels of international control.</p>\n\n<p>Other drugs on Schedule I are cocaine, heroin, morphine, methadone, opium, and oxycodone, the opiate painkiller sold as OxyContin.</p>\n\n<p>\u201cDecades of efforts have been necessary to remove cannabis from Schedule IV, with implications that will slowly but surely be seen over the next decades,\u201d the statement read.</p>\n\n<p>Experts said taking cannabis off the stringent schedule could lead to the relaxing of international controls on medical marijuana.</p>\n\n<p>The cannabis recommendations were first revealed by WHO in January 2019 as part of a complex package of six cannabis-related proposals.</p>\n\n<p>Analyzing implications</p>\n\n<p>Member states took almost two years to analyze the implications of accepting or rejecting the proposals.</p>\n\n<p>Currently, medical cannabis programs have been adopted in more than 50 countries. Uruguay, Canada, and 15 states in the United States have legalized the recreational use of cannabis. Mexico and Luxembourg have taken this path as well.</p>\n\n<p>In the US and Canada, cannabis is used for treating chronic pain, insomnia, depression, post-traumatic stress disorder, anxiety, reducing cancer pain, and that of multiple sclerosis.</p>\n\n<p>Commercially, hemp (a variety of cannabis) is used in making paper, textiles, biodegradable plastics, insulation, clothing, paint, food, biofuel, and animal feed.</p>\n\n<p>According to Visual Capitalist, an online site focusing on business and investment, cannabis (marijuana) is the most lucrative cash crop globally.</p>\n\n<figure><a href=\"https://www.reactorreview.com/?p=24129\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<img src=\"https://i2.wp.com/www.reactorreview.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/128647311_3731164853607531_2949237599127491494_o.jpg?resize=1080%2C675&amp;ssl=1\" alt=\"First Lady: Together we can wipe out killer virus\">\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</a></figure>\n\n<h2><a href=\"https://www.reactorreview.com/?p=24129\">First Lady: Together we can wipe out killer virus</a></h2>\n\n<p>by <a href=\"https://www.reactorreview.com/?author=1\" title=\"Posts by admin\">admin</a> | Dec 2, 2020 | <a href=\"https://www.reactorreview.com/?cat=119\">Health</a></p>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://twitter.com/intent/tweet?url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.reactorreview.com%2F%3Fp%3D24129&amp;via=FelixMu28970705\" data-size=\"large\">Tweet</a></p>\n\n<p>Kenyans yesterday joined the rest of the world in commemorating World Aids Day with calls on stakeholders to step up efforts aimed at lowering infections in the country.</p>\n\n<p>This year\u2019s event was held in Kajiado where the local county government unveiled an ambitious plan to end mother-to-child transmission of HIV and syphilis by the year 2024.</p>\n\n<p>The plan supported by First Lady Margaret Kenyatta\u2019s Beyond Zero will enable Kajiado county to mobilize resources and implement programs aimed at ending the two diseases.</p>\n\n<p>Kajiado county has an HIV prevalence of 3.4 percent with more women infected at 4.5 percent) compared to males at 2.3 percent carrying a disease burden of slightly over 30,000 people living with the virus.</p>\n\n<p>In her recorded message, First Lady Margaret Kenyatta rallied stakeholders to ramp up efforts to end HIV in the country by investing in programs that will help guard vulnerable citizens against the virus.</p>\n\n<p>\u201cThere is a critical need for increased awareness and resources for prevention and treatment of HIV especially amongst our youth, and more work to protect people living with Aids from stigma and discrimination.</p>\n\n<p>\u201cI strongly advocate for zero new infections and zero mother-to-child transmission of HIV.</p>\n\n<p>I continue to encourage mothers to attend at least four antenatal checks where they can receive free testing,\u201d the First Lady said.</p>\n\n<p>In a speech read by CAS Dr. Mercy Mwangangi, Health CS  Mutahi Kagwe said Kenya will defeat HIV through a multi-pronged approach that covers increased awareness, action, and resources.</p>\n\n<p>Kagwe applauded Beyond Zero for its growing investment in the country\u2019s health sector saying in the First Lady\u2019s Beyond Zero initiative saying the initiative had catalyzed the improvement in the provision of health services across the country.</p>\n\n<p>\u201cHer (First Lady Margaret Kenyatta) consistent support for the Government\u2019s Linda Mama Programme under the Universal Healthcare Scheme has led to many mothers delivering in medical facilities assisted by professionals,\u201d said Kagwe.</p>\n\n<figure><a href=\"https://www.reactorreview.com/?p=24123\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<img src=\"https://i1.wp.com/www.reactorreview.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/hiv-drugs.jpg?resize=724%2C483&amp;ssl=1\" alt=\"HEALTH:  Kenya among countries to receive flavoured HIV Drug for children to be rolled out in Africa\">\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</a></figure>\n\n<p>by <a href=\"https://www.reactorreview.com/?author=1\" title=\"Posts by admin\">admin</a> | Dec 2, 2020 | , <a href=\"https://www.reactorreview.com/?cat=119\">Health</a></p>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://twitter.com/intent/tweet?url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.reactorreview.com%2F%3Fp%3D24123&amp;via=FelixMu28970705\" data-size=\"large\">Tweet</a></p>\n\n<p>A strawberry-flavored tablet for children living with HIV will be rolled out in African countries in 2021, the first generic pediatric version of a key anti-retroviral available even for babies, aid agencies said on Tuesday, World AIDS Day.</p>\n\n<p>Some 1.7 million children worldwide live with HIV, but only half receive any treatment \u2014 often hard to administer due to the bitter taste or incorrectly dosed by crushing adult pills, the global health agency UNITAID said.

And read books, and listened, and rested, and exercised, and made art, and played games, and learned new ways of being, and were still. And listened more deeply. Some meditated, some prayed, some danced. Some met their shadows. And the people began to think differently.\n\nWhile this pandemic is turning out to be a very confusing and difficult time for many people, it is undoubtedly giving humanity an incredibly rare opportunity to learn some challenging lessons. For so long it felt that we had been living in a way that went against everything that is natural and sacred.\n\nFor our personal life, we can feel that our priorities have massively shifted due to this pandemic, and it has been eye-opening to see how so much can change in such a short space of time. Most of us are wondering what the future will hold and how this pandemic will change the way we do things.\n\nThis is our silver lining, and it will hopefully allow us to look back on this time and feel there were some benefits. Here are some valuable lessons we will learn from this:\n\nFirstly, the power of stillness. Our lives were put on pause, many were forced to work from home, and we can no longer travel unless necessary. With this, we were given the power of stillness and the opportunity to unapologetically slow down. Take this opportunity to do the inner work that you previously had no time for. If ever there was time for personal transformation, it\u2019s now.\n\nSecondly, friends and family mean everything. Probably, the most difficult part of this journey for most people is being separated from their friends and family. Connection is something that is so critical for our emotional and mental well-being, yet it something we often take for granted.\n\nAfter this is over, I think people will reach out to each other like never before and everyone will be so overjoyed to see their loved ones again. And just maybe we might be a little bolder and share our smiles and greetings with those we don\u2019t even know.\n\nThirdly, nature continues to thrive even if the world has shutdown. For many during this lockdown, including myself, nature has been a life saver. Whether we spend time in our garden, walk through a park, do gardening, grow food, or simply poke our head out of our window for some fresh air and sunlight, the serenity of nature has been something we can rely on. While the world stopped, nature remained constant. Either way, I believe humans will make a renewed relationship with nature and just hopefully, this might lead to a big environmental change.\n\nFourthly, material goods mean nothing. What good are material things when your health, safety, and access to food are jeopardized? They mean zero at times like this, which I think just helps us put into perspective exactly what we should be prioritizing in our lives. Our health is gold. Health is something we so easily take for granted until it is at risk. The possibility of our health taking a downturn has made many of us pay more attention to our nutrition intake and cleanliness. Some of us have even been taking preventative health measures and steps to boost our immune system. If we have a working body with no serious physical ailments, we should be beyond grateful.\n\nFifth, essential workers are heroes. Every good story needs its hero, and in the story that is playing out on our planet right now, our heroes are of course key workers: healthcare workers, delivery drivers, bus and train drivers, and those who work in the supermarkets and food distribution. These are the people who are keeping everything going and right now risking their health and safety every day to do it.\n\nIn the past, so many of these professions were deemed as jobs that require little skill or don\u2019t deserve much pay, but right now there is no saying what we would do without these people. We hope in the future these professions shall be seen with high esteem, and the soldiers fighting on the frontline will be remembered. This pandemic is teaching us one thing, it is not to take anyone or anything for granted.\n\nHow To Deal With Unemployment Among The Youth\n\nby admin | Aug 14, 2020 | , LifeStyle\n\nTweet\n\nAn estimated 800,000 Kenyan youth join the labour market each year whereas unemployment amongst the youth is approximated to be at 35% comparable to the overall national unemployment rate of 10%.\n\nThese figures are staggering, yet there is hope still. Each and every one of us has a natural knack or gift or talent at something. Anything. If not talent, then each one of us has the ability to learn a skill of trade. When you are caught between a rock and a hard place, then you realise that the will to survive does kick in.\n\nAsk yourself, what am I good at? What can I do, at ease that can earn me income? No matter how small at first. Because what\u2019s important is taking that first step. Let us stop looking at the whole picture for a minute. Let us stop thinking about moving from step zero to step a hundred all at once. Instead let us look at moving from step zero to step one. One step at a time.\n\nA journey of a thousand miles starts with one step. Then a step at a time, we shall find that we are actually moving forward. It is so important to move forward always. What\u2019s that saying? If you can\u2019t fly, run. If you can\u2019t run, walk. If you can\u2019t walk, crawl. As long as you keep moving forward.\n\nSo have some alone time to think and analyse yourself critically. What am I good at? Gifted at. Growing up, at school, what did your fellow students casually comment on your gifts? What did your teachers say you are naturally good at? Is it writing, drawing, and sports? Is it music, drama? If you can\u2019t think of anything, then let us open our minds to learning a new skill.\n\nIn the world we live in today, there are a lot of things that we can do. Be it digital marketing, be it the beauty industry. Identify what you are good at, then market yourself. Don\u2019t be shy. Ask for help. Beggars are not choosers. Network. Dare to put yourself out there.\n\nThen before you know it, you have moved from step zero to step one, then step two. If before you didn\u2019t have a thousand shillings. Now you earn that a thousand. You will feel such joy. Such pride. That will propel you to move to step two. Then step three. And as time moves by, you find that you actually have a running business that is earning you income.\n\nThen you get capital to expand your trade. Do more on a larger scale. Then before you know it, the workload becomes too much for just one person, and you hire help. You just created employment! That is creativity .That is innovation.\n\nFor those of us who are blessed with the capability to create employment urge you to take a chance at our Kenyan youth. With caution obviously, but remember, many a folk strive for high ideals. Thus your calculated risk may just turn into a profitable venture.\n\nGive that friend you know that job you need done. That assignment you need get done. Give the youth a chance. They are the future. And they may surprise you with their talent, and natural gifts. Let us support the local traders rather than rushing to import. As consumers, let us buy from that local manufacturer instead of going for that expensive imported product.\n\nLet us support our own.

And if in a year we have 10 million recovered people, and those people have cognitive deficits \u2026 then that\u2019s going to affect their ability to work and their ability to go about activities of daily living,\u201d Adrian Owen, a neuroscientist at Western University in Canada, told Reuters in an interview.\n\nIn the UCL study, published in the journal Brain, nine patients who had brain inflammation were diagnosed with a rare condition called acute disseminated encephalomyelitis (ADEM) which is more usually seen in children and can be triggered by viral infections.\n\nThe team said it would normally see about one adult patient with ADEM per month at their specialist London clinic, but this had risen to at least once a week during the study period, something they described as \u201ca concerning increase\u201d.\n\n\u201cGiven that the disease has only been around for a matter of months, we might not yet know what long-term damage COVID-19 can cause,\u201d said Ross Paterson, who co-led the study. \u201cDoctors need to be aware of possible neurological effects, as early diagnosis can improve patient outcomes.\u201d\n\nOwen said the emerging evidence underlined the need for large, detailed studies and global data collection to assess how common such neurological and psychiatric complications were.\n\nHe is running an international research project at covidbrainstudy.com where patients can sign up to complete a series of cognitive tests to see whether their brain functions have altered since getting COVID-19.\n\n\u201cThis disease is affecting an enormous number of people,\u201d Owen said. \u201cThat\u2019s why it\u2019s so important to collect this information now.\u201d\n\nHow \u2018Joan Kubai\u2019 has Stupidly Exposed Her Corrupt and Dirty Parents to Detectives-VIDEO\n\nby admin | Jul 7, 2020 | Entertainment, LifeStyle\n\nTweet\n\nAs you struggle to raise the rent for your bedsitter, a family in Runda has dedicated a whole bedroom to folding clothes.\n\nThis is what has surprised most Kenyans as one Joan Kubai shared a video of her luxurious home on Snapchat.\n\nThe teen took her virtual friends to a tour of her humongous home in Runda which has five bedrooms, four living rooms and a library in the artic.\n\nOutside the home, you are greeted to a lush green garden and swimming pool. There is also a garage for the family\u2019s numerous vehicles.\n\nWhere does one get the money for all these? It seems that Joan\u2019s parents just like most rich Kenyans got their wealth through backdoor means.\n\nThe famous Twitter Detectives have dug deep and revealed some details about the Kubai family that Joan would wish they remained buried. Joan Kubai is the daughter of city tycoons Peter Macharia Kubai and Isabella Wairimu Kubai.\n\nPeter Macharia Kubai and Isabella Wairimu Kubai are joint directors of Benisa Limited, a firm which at the centre of two separate investigations by the Ethics and Anti-Corruption Commission (EACC) into Murang\u2019 a Governor Mwangi wa Iria\u2019s alleged violation of the public procurement law and ghost projects in the county.\n\nBenisa had been hired by the now-bankrupt Italian firm CMC Di Ravenna on May 15, 2015, as a subcontractor to do several works on the Itare dam project for Sh360 million.\n\nAt the time, the Italian firm accused Benisa of deploying inadequate staff and resources on-site and terminated the contract on June 22, 2018.\n\nThe company is believed to be part of a network of companies Mr Peter Macharia Kubai and his family have been accused of using to secure double payment for the same work, and in most instances, no work is done.\n\nOn this basis, Benisa Limited was, for instance, paid twice to construct a single water pan at Kangutu in Kakuzi Mitubiri ward.\n\nAccording to documents, the first tender that was paid through LPO number 2835/2014 was worth Sh3.97 million while the second that was paid through LPO number 2724-2775/2 was worth Sh3.99 million.\n\nMr Peter Macharia Kubai is also being investigated for allegedly giving juicy kickbacks to Governor Mwangi Wa Iria to secure lucrative road repair tenders.\n\nWhile digging up through the file, sleuths from EACC also stumbled onto Benisa Limited while investigating the stalled Marsabit Stadium, where the firm was paid over Sh88 million with only 20 per cent of the work done.\n\nOn July 30, 2019, Benisa Limited obtained a default judgment in a suit it filed against CMC Di Ravenna to recover Sh31.5 million for rock blasting works it did in the Itare dam project, which has also collapsed and is at the centre of a Directorate of Criminal Investigation (DCI) probe.\n\nDocuments at the Companies\u2019 Registry show that Benisa Limited is owned by Peter Macharia Kubai (50%), Isabella Wairimu Kubai (25%) and Jadiel Macharia Kubai the remaining percentage.\n\nAll the three are said to be business associates of Murang\u2019 a county Governor Mwangi Wa Iria.\n\nby admin | Jun 26, 2020 | LifeStyle, News\n\nTweet\n\nThe government has decried increasing cases of children accessing inappropriate content following the closure of schools over the COVID-19 pandemic.

And read books, and listened, and rested, and exercised, and made art, and played games, and learned new ways of being, and were still. And listened more deeply. Some meditated, some prayed, some danced. Some met their shadows. And the people began to think differently.</p>\n\n<p>While this pandemic is turning out to be a very confusing and difficult time for many people, it is undoubtedly giving humanity an incredibly rare opportunity to learn some challenging lessons. For so long it felt that we had been living in a way that went against everything that is natural and sacred.</p>\n\n<p>For our personal life, we can feel that our priorities have massively shifted due to this pandemic, and it has been eye-opening to see how so much can change in such a short space of time. Most of us are wondering what the future will hold and how this pandemic will change the way we do things.</p>\n\n<p>This is our silver lining, and it will hopefully allow us to look back on this time and feel there were some benefits. Here are some valuable lessons we will learn from this:</p>\n\n<p>Firstly, the power of stillness. Our lives were put on pause, many were forced to work from home, and we can no longer travel unless necessary. With this, we were given the power of stillness and the opportunity to unapologetically slow down. Take this opportunity to do the inner work that you previously had no time for. If ever there was time for personal transformation, it\u2019s now.</p>\n\n<p>Secondly, friends and family mean everything. Probably, the most difficult part of this journey for most people is being separated from their friends and family. Connection is something that is so critical for our emotional and mental well-being, yet it something we often take for granted.</p>\n\n<p>After this is over, I think people will reach out to each other like never before and everyone will be so overjoyed to see their loved ones again. And just maybe we might be a little bolder and share our smiles and greetings with those we don\u2019t even know.</p>\n\n<p>Thirdly, nature continues to thrive even if the world has shutdown. For many during this lockdown, including myself, nature has been a life saver. Whether we spend time in our garden, walk through a park, do gardening, grow food, or simply poke our head out of our window for some fresh air and sunlight, the serenity of nature has been something we can rely on. While the world stopped, nature remained constant. Either way, I believe humans will make a renewed relationship with nature and just hopefully, this might lead to a big environmental change.</p>\n\n<p>Fourthly, material goods mean nothing. What good are material things when your health, safety, and access to food are jeopardized? They mean zero at times like this, which I think just helps us put into perspective exactly what we should be prioritizing in our lives. Our health is gold. Health is something we so easily take for granted until it is at risk. The possibility of our health taking a downturn has made many of us pay more attention to our nutrition intake and cleanliness. Some of us have even been taking preventative health measures and steps to boost our immune system. If we have a working body with no serious physical ailments, we should be beyond grateful.</p>\n\n<p>Fifth, essential workers are heroes. Every good story needs its hero, and in the story that is playing out on our planet right now, our heroes are of course key workers: healthcare workers, delivery drivers, bus and train drivers, and those who work in the supermarkets and food distribution. These are the people who are keeping everything going and right now risking their health and safety every day to do it.</p>\n\n<p>In the past, so many of these professions were deemed as jobs that require little skill or don\u2019t deserve much pay, but right now there is no saying what we would do without these people. We hope in the future these professions shall be seen with high esteem, and the soldiers fighting on the frontline will be remembered. This pandemic is teaching us one thing, it is not to take anyone or anything for granted.</p>\n\n<figure><a href=\"https://www.reactorreview.com/?p=18215\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<img src=\"https://i1.wp.com/www.reactorreview.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/IMG_20200814_103614.jpg?resize=1079%2C675&amp;ssl=1\" alt=\"How To Deal With Unemployment Among The Youth\">\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</a></figure>\n\n<h2><a href=\"https://www.reactorreview.com/?p=18215\">How To Deal With Unemployment Among The Youth</a></h2>\n\n<p>by <a href=\"https://www.reactorreview.com/?author=1\" title=\"Posts by admin\">admin</a> | Aug 14, 2020 | , <a href=\"https://www.reactorreview.com/?cat=100\">LifeStyle</a></p>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://twitter.com/intent/tweet?url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.reactorreview.com%2F%3Fp%3D18215&amp;via=FelixMu28970705\" data-size=\"large\">Tweet</a></p>\n\n<p>An estimated 800,000 Kenyan youth join the labour market each year whereas unemployment amongst the youth is approximated to be at 35% comparable to the overall national unemployment rate of 10%.</p>\n\n<p>These figures are staggering, yet there is hope still. Each and every one of us has a natural knack or gift or talent at something. Anything. If not talent, then each one of us has the ability to learn a skill of trade. When you are caught between a rock and a hard place, then you realise that the will to survive does kick in.</p>\n\n<p>Ask yourself, what am I good at? What can I do, at ease that can earn me income? No matter how small at first. Because what\u2019s important is taking that first step. Let us stop looking at the whole picture for a minute. Let us stop thinking about moving from step zero to step a hundred all at once. Instead let us look at moving from step zero to step one. One step at a time.</p>\n\n<blockquote><p>A journey of a thousand miles starts with one step. Then a step at a time, we shall find that we are actually moving forward. It is so important to move forward always. What\u2019s that saying? If you can\u2019t fly, run. If you can\u2019t run, walk. If you can\u2019t walk, crawl. As long as you keep moving forward.</p></blockquote>\n\n<p>So have some alone time to think and analyse yourself critically. What am I good at? Gifted at. Growing up, at school, what did your fellow students casually comment on your gifts? What did your teachers say you are naturally good at? Is it writing, drawing, and sports? Is it music, drama? If you can\u2019t think of anything, then let us open our minds to learning a new skill.</p>\n\n<p>In the world we live in today, there are a lot of things that we can do. Be it digital marketing, be it the beauty industry. Identify what you are good at, then market yourself. Don\u2019t be shy. Ask for help. Beggars are not choosers. Network. Dare to put yourself out there.</p>\n\n<p>Then before you know it, you have moved from step zero to step one, then step two. If before you didn\u2019t have a thousand shillings. Now you earn that a thousand. You will feel such joy. Such pride. That will propel you to move to step two. Then step three. And as time moves by, you find that you actually have a running business that is earning you income.</p>\n\n<p>Then you get capital to expand your trade. Do more on a larger scale. Then before you know it, the workload becomes too much for just one person, and you hire help. You just created employment! That is creativity .That is innovation.</p>\n\n<p>For those of us who are blessed with the capability to create employment urge you to take a chance at our Kenyan youth. With caution obviously, but remember, many a folk strive for high ideals. Thus your calculated risk may just turn into a profitable venture.</p>\n\n<p>Give that friend you know that job you need done. That assignment you need get done. Give the youth a chance. They are the future. And they may surprise you with their talent, and natural gifts. Let us support the local traders rather than rushing to import. As consumers, let us buy from that local manufacturer instead of going for that expensive imported product.</p>\n\n<p>Let us support our own. Because we have the solution in our hands. Right here. We just have to think outside the box. Push ourselves beyond our comfort zone. The human brain is malleable and expandable to accommodate the need to survive. Necessity is the mother of invention. Where there is a will, there is always a way. Let us do this!</p>\n\n<figure><a href=\"https://www.reactorreview.com/?p=16479\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<img src=\"https://i1.wp.com/www.reactorreview.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/923992-64395-uhpxocgvmn-1501335829.jpg?resize=1080%2C630&amp;ssl=1\" alt=\"Scientists warn of a potential wave of COVID-linked brain damage\">\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</a></figure>\n\n<h2><a href=\"https://www.reactorreview.com/?p=16479\">Scientists warn of a potential wave of COVID-linked brain damage</a></h2>\n\n<p>by <a href=\"https://www.reactorreview.com/?author=1\" title=\"Posts by admin\">admin</a> | Jul 8, 2020 | <a href=\"https://www.reactorreview.com/?cat=100\">LifeStyle</a></p>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://twitter.com/intent/tweet?url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.reactorreview.com%2F%3Fp%3D16479&amp;via=FelixMu28970705\" data-size=\"large\">Tweet</a></p>\n\n<p>LONDON (Reuters) \u2013 Scientists warned on Wednesday of a potential wave of coronavirus-related brain damage as new evidence suggested COVID-19 can lead to severe neurological complications, including inflammation, psychosis and delirium.</p>\n\n<p>A study by researchers at University College London (UCL)described 43 cases of patients with COVID-19 who suffered either temporary brain dysfunction, strokes, nerve damage or other serious brain effects.</p>\n\n<p>The research adds to recent studies which also found the disease can damage the brain.</p>\n\n<blockquote><p><strong>\u201cWhether we will see an epidemic on a large scale of brain damage linked to the pandemic \u2013 perhaps similar to the encephalitis lethargica outbreak in the 1920s and 1930s after the 1918 influenza pandemic \u2013 remains to be seen,\u201d said Michael Zandi, from UCL\u2019s Institute of Neurology, who co-led the study.</strong></p></blockquote>\n\n<p>COVID-19, the disease caused by the new coronavirus, is largely a respiratory illness that affects the lungs, but neuroscientists and specialist brain doctors say emerging evidence of its impact on the brain is concerning.</p>\n\n<p>My worry is that we have millions of people with COVID-19 now.

The impact of COVID-19 on development can either be a massive barrier to advancement or the spark that lights up innovation and investment across the continent.\n\nThere\u2019s no denying that for most of the world, the pandemic has pushed digital adoption forward in vast leaps in a short time. What the pandemic has also made apparent is the disparities of infrastructure across Africa, as well as gaps in adoption and policy.\n\nIt\u2019s now a necessity, rather than a luxury to fast-track adoption of technology. By increasing productivity and facilitating innovation, technology is a key sector for the economic development of any country, and those who have embarked on their digital transformation journeys are better equipped to handle the obstacles that arise.\n\nAs COVID-19 has introduced social distancing and lockdown orders across the continent, the need for digital connectivity is more essential than ever. And as the pandemic spreads beyond major cities into peri-urban and rural areas, unconnected or under-connected populations risk becoming more vulnerable and isolated as they lack digital means to access essential services.\n\nWi-Fi hotspots can provide connectivity to COVID-19 testing stations and field hospitals and can support remote working and learning. Microsoft has been championing use of TV White Spaces (TVWS), which uses unused portions of spectrum for tv broadcasting, to bring broadband and internet-connected solutions.\n\nIn Kenya, Project Mawingu connects schools, the Laikipia County Government Office, Laikipia Public Library, Red Cross and the Burguret Dispensary Healthcare Clinic. Through this and other partnerships, we\u2019ve demonstrated how new technologies, business models and regulatory approaches expand internet access and support public policy goals around education, healthcare, e-government and other priorities.\n\nThis, in turn, motivates governments to adopt more regulations opening up access to TVWS frequencies. As much as we talk about the need for intensive ICT investment in infrastructure and technology that will support Africa\u2019s engagement in the Fourth Industrial Revolution (4IR), this will not happen without human infrastructure to support it.\n\nFor Africa to fully realise opportunities brought about by digital transformation and 4IR, it is vital we have strong ICT skills. We refer to this as having \u2018tech intensity\u2019 \u2013 the ability to not just adopt emerging technology but develop capabilities to effectively use it. Skills development has a crucial role to play, both in skilling new resources \u2013 our youth \u2013 and in upskilling our current workforce to play their part in supporting ICT infrastructure development.\n\nThere is an abundance of talent and ingenuity in start-ups and entrepreneurs across the continent. Investing in them is as important as any other ICT investment. Beyond future workforce, digital talent will also support more local innovation, as developers and entrepreneurs are empowered to create locally relevant solutions that best address challenges and needs in various sectors.\n\nAfrican governments have important roles to play in developing sound digital policies and stable harmonised regulatory environments that enable people and businesses to participate fully in the global digital economy.\n\nNow more than ever, we need to pay close attention to how organisations transform digitally, what changes they face in acquiring new technologies and broadband, and daily challenges they may be facing in the area of digital skills development.\n\nIf African governments, together with private partners and organisations, can invest in these areas through supporting start-up innovation, through contributing to skills development and in many other verticals, this will drive meaningful gains towards unlocking Africa\u2019s vibrant potential.\n\nMobile Connectivity Is A Goldmine And We Must Unlock Its Potential In Kenya\n\nTweet\n\nAdvancing far more quickly than other countries in Sub-Saharan Africa, Kenya has seen a rapid expansion of the adoption of mobile technology and mobile connectivity in recent years.\n\nThere\u2019s debate about just how many Kenyans are internet users, but numbers have increased substantially over the last 20 years, with just 200,000 reported users in 2000 increasing to nearly 47 million in 2019, largely driven by increased access to mobile broadband, mobile data subscriptions, and low-cost smartphones.\n\nIn 2019, mobile penetration in Kenya was at 112% with over 53 million mobile connections in the country, according to the Communications Authority of Kenya.\n\nBeyond connecting locals with each other and the rest of the world, mobile Internet has started to infiltrate into different sectors of Kenya\u2019s economy, enhancing financial services, education and health, to name a few. M-PESA is a prime example of how mobile connectivity has transformed an entire industry, allowing millions of Kenyans to send and receive money.\n\nAlready making a substantial economic contribution in the country accounting for around 3% of Kenya\u2019s Gross Domestic Product (GDP), the mobile sector\u2019s impact will only grow as network coverage expands, especially as 5G technology starts to take off on the continent.\n\nAnd with economic advantages come social benefits too, including improved access to information, digital products and public services, facilitating innovation, entrepreneurship and international trade.\n\nThe knock-on value of mobile connectivity in Kenya cannot be overstated. However, how do we go about harnessing its benefits? Driving accelerated mobile adoption through universal access is a good starting point. Let\u2019s look at what that means for our country.\n\nWhile Kenya is considered a digital transformation pacesetter in the region, many mobile users are still on 2G networks due to budgetary constraints and technology gaps. To truly reap the benefits of mobile connectivity, these barriers need to be addressed so that more Kenyans can utilise key services enabled by 3G and 4G technologies.\n\nIncome inequality is an important factor to consider, mobile affordability for those on low incomes (an estimated 20-40% of the population) is much higher, and, therefore, presents a challenge to universal broadband coverage across the country.\n\nCost-effective and easily accessible mobile connectivity options need to be made available for those who can\u2019t afford current packages. Digital skills are also necessary for increased mobile Internet adoption. Users need to be able to engage with mobile technologies effectively to realise the full economic and social potential of connectivity.\n\nDeveloping the population\u2019s digital skills is crucial for them to survive in a mobile-geared world. Kenya has made excellent progress in the last few years to create an empowering environment that promotes universal mobile access.\n\nTo ensure an increased uptake continues, investments need to be made not only in providing mobile internet but educating locals on the options that are available for their unique needs. As many Kenyans rely on word of mouth, awareness of the latest mobile developments is important for them to make use of these technologies.\n\nGovernments and operators in this space have a critical responsibility to drive digital transformation through increased investments in mobile networks and practical solutions for barriers to adoption.\n\nWith more supportive policies in place, and initiatives geared to improve the affordability of mobile services and the education of these technologies, Kenyans, in all areas, of all backgrounds and incomes, can tap into the power of mobile connectivity.\n\nLAUGHABLE: Governors forced to apologise after being roped into twitter\u2019s \u2018sco pa tu manaa\u2019 muddle\n\nby admin | Aug 6, 2019 | Technology\n\nTweet\n\nThe Council of Governors was on Monday forced to apologise after one of their social media handlers used their official twitter account to endorse loud sex.\n\nTrouble started when a netizen, identified as Kimone Pitterson, initiated a trending phrase, \u201cSco pa tu manaa\u201d which asks users to contribute their thoughts about a particular topic or person.\n\nPitterson\u2019s subject matter was on the matter of talking during sexual intercourse which was endorsed by Taruri Gatere.\n\nGatere\u2019s tweet accidentally won the endorsement of the Council of Governors after their official handle retweeted her sentiments.\n\n\u201c Yes Please. Say my name. Moan. Tell me how it feels. Tell me what you like. Tell me how much you like it. Ask me questions I cant answer because I\u2019m too into it. Look into my eyes and smile and say hi. I love that sh*t! \u201d the retweeted message stated.\n\nThe CoG\u2019s apparent endorsement of the tweet quickly went viral before the handlers realised their blunder.\n\n\u201c Sincerest apologies. We sincerely apologize for the inappropriate retweet through our twitter handle. We have regained control of our handle and have put proper measures to ensure this does not occur again,\u201d the Governors\u2019 forum stated.\n\nCoG is one of the many prominent personalities and corporates who have landed in trouble after retweeting, liking, or posting inappropriate material.\n\nSafaricom was recently on the spot after one of its social media editors used its official handle to publish tweets disparaging Kenyans demanding for a Kenyan to succeed former CEO Bob Collymore.\n\n\u201c Let the government first improve management in Muhoroni, NHIF, Mumias, Kenya Airways and Kenya Pipeline and many other organisations that have deliberately been run down by state appointees before they can think of imposing their choice on Safaricom,\u201d said the giant telco.\n\nThey later blamed the inappropriate language on a \u201csystem glitch\u201d.\n\n\u201c Good morning. We apologise for the series of tweets that went out from our official accounts last night. We had a system glitch that has since been rectified. Thank you,\u201d Safaricom said.\n\nThe errors are often caused by the fact that social media editors run multiple accounts, including their personal accounts which brings about the risk of accidentally interchanging the handles.\n\nTrade War Casualties: Huawei and the cold tech war between US and China\n\nTweet\n\nAlphabet Inc\u2019s Google has suspended business with Huawei that requires the transfer of hardware, software and technical services except those publicly available via open source licensing, a source familiar with the matter told Reuters on Sunday, in a blow to the Chinese technology company that the U.S. government has sought to blacklist around the world.\n\nHolders of current Huawei smartphones with Google apps, however, will continue to be able to use and download app updates provided by Google, a Google spokesperson said, confirming earlier reporting by Reuters.\n\n\u201cWe are complying with the order and reviewing the implications,\u201d the Google spokesperson said.\n\n\u201cFor users of our services, Google Play and the security protections from Google Play Protect will continue to function on existing Huawei devices,\u201d the spokesperson said, without giving further\n\nThis is so much more than a dispute about tariffs.\n\nChina and the United States are competing for global dominance in technologies of the future: artificial intelligence, robotics and 5G high-speed mobile phone networks.\n\nThat has been on display this week at the World Artificial Intelligence Conference in the northern Chinese city of Tianjin, where the mood has been surprisingly upbeat despite the trade war between the world\u2019s two biggest economies.\n\nChinese President Xi Jinping wants Beijing to be a world leader in this sector, believing it will help move his country\u2019s economy up the value chain and improve the lives of his people.\n\nBut US President Donald Trump sees it very differently. He says China wants global tech dominance and does not care how it is achieved.\n\nShen Hongyuan, a local Huawei manager, politely declined to answer questions about whether he felt the company\u2019s business was now finished in the US. Again, like Yin from Honeywell, he wanted to stress the positive. \u201cWe hope we can cooperate with other countries,\u201d he said.\n\nIn truth, the US has become far less important as a market for Huawei than other parts of the world \u2013 at least in terms of its smartphones.\n\nPresident Donald Trump talks with Chinese President Xi Jinping, with their wives, first lady Melania Trump and Chinese first lady Peng Liyuan as they pose for photographers before dinner at Mar-a-Lago, Thursday, April 6, 2017, in Palm Beach, Fla.\n\n\u201cHuawei has not been able to crack the US market. And that\u2019s where it gets interesting, because \u2026 still, every quarter Huawei is growing at a record rate. So it is still growing in China, and that is spectacular. And the next region it\u2019s growing in is Europe, and Southeast Asia,\u201d Shobhit Srivastava, an India-based analyst at Counterpoint Research, told Al Jazeera by phone.\n\nBut it\u2019s the Middle East and Africa where sales of Huawei phones are growing the fastest, recording a 68 percent expansion in the first quarter of this year compared with the same period in 2018, according to Counterpoint.\n\nThe research firm says 17 percent of the world\u2019s smartphones were made by Huawei in the first quarter, making it the second-biggest maker behind Samsung and one notch before Apple.\n\nTo China\u2019s leadership, the US case against Huawei is connected, driven by bewilderment and jealousy that one company has come so far, so quickly.\n\nBut to the Trump administration, Huawei represents all that is wrong with China\u2019s economy \u2013 a success story built on stolen technology.\n\nBut, make no mistake, this is serious for Huawei.\n\nOf top concern will be its inclusion on the US Commerce Department\u2019s \u201cEntity List.\u201d This means US firms that sell key components \u2013 like the chips used in Huawei phones \u2013 will have to apply for a license. That is going to make it very difficult for Huawei to do business with any US firm.\n\nAnalysts say they are digging in for the long haul.\n\n\u201cThe US-China trade conflict shows no sign of de-escalating anytime soon, as the White House banned Huawei from selling equipment to the US market and required US companies to obtain licences in order to sell chips and technology to Huawei,\u201d CMC Markets analyst Margaret Yang said in a research note.\n\nTwelve new lenses you won\u2019t be able to live without\n\nTweet\n\nOporteat delicata constituam in nec.

The impact of COVID-19 on development can either be a massive barrier to advancement or the spark that lights up innovation and investment across the continent.</p>\n\n<p>There\u2019s no denying that for most of the world, the pandemic has pushed digital adoption forward in vast leaps in a short time. What the pandemic has also made apparent is the disparities of infrastructure across Africa, as well as gaps in adoption and policy.</p>\n\n<p>It\u2019s now a necessity, rather than a luxury to fast-track adoption of technology. By increasing productivity and facilitating innovation, technology is a key sector for the economic development of any country, and those who have embarked on their digital transformation journeys are better equipped to handle the obstacles that arise.</p>\n\n<p>As COVID-19 has introduced social distancing and lockdown orders across the continent, the need for digital connectivity is more essential than ever. And as the pandemic spreads beyond major cities into peri-urban and rural areas, unconnected or under-connected populations risk becoming more vulnerable and isolated as they lack digital means to access essential services.</p>\n\n<p>Wi-Fi hotspots can provide connectivity to COVID-19 testing stations and field hospitals and can support remote working and learning. Microsoft has been championing use of TV White Spaces (TVWS), which uses unused portions of spectrum for tv broadcasting, to bring broadband and internet-connected solutions.</p>\n\n<p>In Kenya, Project Mawingu connects schools, the Laikipia County Government Office, Laikipia Public Library, Red Cross and the Burguret Dispensary Healthcare Clinic. Through this and other partnerships, we\u2019ve demonstrated how new technologies, business models and regulatory approaches expand internet access and support public policy goals around education, healthcare, e-government and other priorities.</p>\n\n<p>This, in turn, motivates governments to adopt more regulations opening up access to TVWS frequencies. As much as we talk about the need for intensive ICT investment in infrastructure and technology that will support Africa\u2019s engagement in the Fourth Industrial Revolution (4IR), this will not happen without human infrastructure to support it.</p>\n\n<p>For Africa to fully realise opportunities brought about by digital transformation and 4IR, it is vital we have strong ICT skills. We refer to this as having \u2018tech intensity\u2019 \u2013 the ability to not just adopt emerging technology but develop capabilities to effectively use it. Skills development has a crucial role to play, both in skilling new resources \u2013 our youth \u2013 and in upskilling our current workforce to play their part in supporting ICT infrastructure development.</p>\n\n<p>There is an abundance of talent and ingenuity in start-ups and entrepreneurs across the continent. Investing in them is as important as any other ICT investment. Beyond future workforce, digital talent will also support more local innovation, as developers and entrepreneurs are empowered to create locally relevant solutions that best address challenges and needs in various sectors.</p>\n\n<p>African governments have important roles to play in developing sound digital policies and stable harmonised regulatory environments that enable people and businesses to participate fully in the global digital economy.</p>\n\n<p>Now more than ever, we need to pay close attention to how organisations transform digitally, what changes they face in acquiring new technologies and broadband, and daily challenges they may be facing in the area of digital skills development.</p>\n\n<p>If African governments, together with private partners and organisations, can invest in these areas through supporting start-up innovation, through contributing to skills development and in many other verticals, this will drive meaningful gains towards unlocking Africa\u2019s vibrant potential.</p>\n\n<figure><a href=\"https://www.reactorreview.com/?p=18364\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<img src=\"https://i0.wp.com/www.reactorreview.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/IMG-20200818-WA0002.jpg?resize=804%2C564&amp;ssl=1\" alt=\"Mobile Connectivity Is A Goldmine And We Must Unlock Its Potential In Kenya\">\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</a></figure>\n\n<h2><a href=\"https://www.reactorreview.com/?p=18364\">Mobile Connectivity Is A Goldmine And We Must Unlock Its Potential In Kenya</a></h2>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://twitter.com/intent/tweet?url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.reactorreview.com%2F%3Fp%3D18364&amp;via=FelixMu28970705\" data-size=\"large\">Tweet</a></p>\n\n<p>Advancing far more quickly than other countries in Sub-Saharan Africa, Kenya has seen a rapid expansion of the adoption of mobile technology and mobile connectivity in recent years.</p>\n\n<p>There\u2019s debate about just how many Kenyans are internet users, but numbers have increased substantially over the last 20 years, with just 200,000 reported users in 2000 increasing to nearly 47 million in 2019, largely driven by increased access to mobile broadband, mobile data subscriptions, and low-cost smartphones.</p>\n\n<p>In 2019, mobile penetration in Kenya was at 112% with over 53 million mobile connections in the country, according to the Communications Authority of Kenya.</p>\n\n<blockquote><p>Beyond connecting locals with each other and the rest of the world, mobile Internet has started to infiltrate into different sectors of Kenya\u2019s economy, enhancing financial services, education and health, to name a few. M-PESA is a prime example of how mobile connectivity has transformed an entire industry, allowing millions of Kenyans to send and receive money.</p></blockquote>\n\n<p>Already making a substantial economic contribution in the country accounting for around 3% of Kenya\u2019s Gross Domestic Product (GDP), the mobile sector\u2019s impact will only grow as network coverage expands, especially as 5G technology starts to take off on the continent.</p>\n\n<p>And with economic advantages come social benefits too, including improved access to information, digital products and public services, facilitating innovation, entrepreneurship and international trade.</p>\n\n<p>The knock-on value of mobile connectivity in Kenya cannot be overstated. However, how do we go about harnessing its benefits? Driving accelerated mobile adoption through universal access is a good starting point. Let\u2019s look at what that means for our country.</p>\n\n<p>While Kenya is considered a digital transformation pacesetter in the region, many mobile users are still on 2G networks due to budgetary constraints and technology gaps. To truly reap the benefits of mobile connectivity, these barriers need to be addressed so that more Kenyans can utilise key services enabled by 3G and 4G technologies.</p>\n\n<p>Income inequality is an important factor to consider, mobile affordability for those on low incomes (an estimated 20-40% of the population) is much higher, and, therefore, presents a challenge to universal broadband coverage across the country.</p>\n\n<blockquote><p>Cost-effective and easily accessible mobile connectivity options need to be made available for those who can\u2019t afford current packages. Digital skills are also necessary for increased mobile Internet adoption. Users need to be able to engage with mobile technologies effectively to realise the full economic and social potential of connectivity.</p></blockquote>\n\n<p>Developing the population\u2019s digital skills is crucial for them to survive in a mobile-geared world. Kenya has made excellent progress in the last few years to create an empowering environment that promotes universal mobile access.</p>\n\n<p>To ensure an increased uptake continues, investments need to be made not only in providing mobile internet but educating locals on the options that are available for their unique needs. As many Kenyans rely on word of mouth, awareness of the latest mobile developments is important for them to make use of these technologies.</p>\n\n<p>Governments and operators in this space have a critical responsibility to drive digital transformation through increased investments in mobile networks and practical solutions for barriers to adoption.</p>\n\n<p>With more supportive policies in place, and initiatives geared to improve the affordability of mobile services and the education of these technologies, Kenyans, in all areas, of all backgrounds and incomes, can tap into the power of mobile connectivity.</p>\n\n<figure><a href=\"https://www.reactorreview.com/?p=8007\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<img src=\"https://i0.wp.com/www.reactorreview.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/COG.jpg?resize=780%2C405&amp;ssl=1\" alt=\"LAUGHABLE: Governors forced to apologise after being roped into twitter\u2019s  \u2018sco pa tu manaa\u2019 muddle\">\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</a></figure>\n\n<h2><a href=\"https://www.reactorreview.com/?p=8007\">LAUGHABLE: Governors forced to apologise after being roped into twitter\u2019s  \u2018sco pa tu manaa\u2019 muddle</a></h2>\n\n<p>by <a href=\"https://www.reactorreview.com/?author=1\" title=\"Posts by admin\">admin</a> | Aug 6, 2019 | <a href=\"https://www.reactorreview.com/?cat=103\">Technology</a></p>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://twitter.com/intent/tweet?url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.reactorreview.com%2F%3Fp%3D8007&amp;via=FelixMu28970705\" data-size=\"large\">Tweet</a></p>\n\n<p>The Council of Governors was on Monday forced to apologise after one of their social media handlers used their official twitter account to endorse loud sex.</p>\n\n<p>Trouble started when a netizen, identified as Kimone Pitterson, initiated a trending phrase, \u201cSco pa tu manaa\u201d which asks users to contribute their thoughts about a particular topic or person.</p>\n\n<p>Pitterson\u2019s subject matter was on the matter of talking during sexual intercourse which was endorsed by Taruri Gatere.</p>\n\n<p>Gatere\u2019s tweet accidentally won the endorsement of the Council of Governors after their official handle retweeted her sentiments.</p>\n\n<p>\u201c<em>Yes Please. Say my name. Moan. Tell me how it feels. Tell me what you like. Tell me how much you like it. Ask me questions I cant answer because I\u2019m too into it. Look into my eyes and smile and say hi. I love that sh*t!</em>\u201d the retweeted message stated.</p>\n\n<p>The CoG\u2019s apparent endorsement of the tweet quickly went viral before the handlers realised their blunder.</p>\n\n<blockquote><p><strong>\u201c<em>Sincerest apologies. We sincerely apologize for the inappropriate retweet through our twitter handle. We have regained control of our handle and have put proper measures to ensure this does not occur again</em>,\u201d the Governors\u2019 forum stated.</strong></p></blockquote>\n\n<p>CoG is one of the many prominent personalities and corporates who have landed in trouble after retweeting, liking, or posting inappropriate material.</p>\n\n<p>Safaricom was recently on the spot after one of its social media editors used its official handle to publish tweets disparaging Kenyans demanding for a Kenyan to succeed former CEO Bob Collymore.</p>\n\n<p>\u201c<em>Let the government first improve management in Muhoroni, NHIF, Mumias, Kenya Airways and Kenya Pipeline and many other organisations that have deliberately been run down by state appointees before they can think of imposing their choice on Safaricom</em>,\u201d said the giant telco.</p>\n\n<p>They later blamed the inappropriate language on a \u201csystem glitch\u201d.</p>\n\n<blockquote><p><strong>\u201c<em>Good morning. We apologise for the series of tweets that went out from our official accounts last night. We had a system glitch that has since been rectified. Thank you</em>,\u201d Safaricom said.</strong></p></blockquote>\n\n<p>The errors are often caused by the fact that social media editors run multiple accounts, including their personal accounts which brings about the risk of accidentally interchanging the handles.</p>\n\n<figure><a href=\"https://www.reactorreview.com/?p=6589\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<img src=\"https://i2.wp.com/www.reactorreview.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/Trump-and-china-wars.jpg?resize=800%2C430&amp;ssl=1\" alt=\"Trade War Casualties: Huawei and the cold tech war between US and China\">\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</a></figure>\n\n<h2><a href=\"https://www.reactorreview.com/?p=6589\">Trade War Casualties: Huawei and the cold tech war between US and China</a></h2>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://twitter.com/intent/tweet?url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.reactorreview.com%2F%3Fp%3D6589&amp;via=FelixMu28970705\" data-size=\"large\">Tweet</a></p>\n\n<p>Alphabet Inc\u2019s Google has suspended business with Huawei that requires the transfer of hardware, software and technical services except those publicly available via open source licensing, a source familiar with the matter told Reuters on Sunday, in a blow to the Chinese technology company that the U.S. government has sought to blacklist around the world.</p>\n\n<p>Holders of current Huawei smartphones with Google apps, however, will continue to be able to use and download app updates provided by Google, a Google spokesperson said, confirming earlier reporting by Reuters.</p>\n\n<blockquote><p><strong>\u201cWe are complying with the order and reviewing the implications,\u201d the Google spokesperson said. </strong></p>\n<p><strong>\u201cFor users of our services, Google Play and the security protections from Google Play Protect will continue to function on existing Huawei devices,\u201d the spokesperson said, without giving further</strong></p></blockquote>\n\n<p>This is so much more than a dispute about tariffs.</p>\n\n<p>China and the United States are competing for global dominance in technologies of the future: artificial intelligence, robotics and 5G high-speed mobile phone networks.</p>\n\n<p>That has been on display this week at the World Artificial Intelligence Conference in the northern Chinese city of Tianjin, where the mood has been surprisingly upbeat despite the trade war between the world\u2019s two biggest economies.</p>\n\n<p>Chinese President Xi Jinping wants Beijing to be a world leader in this sector, believing it will help move his country\u2019s economy up the value chain and improve the lives of his people.</p>\n\n<p>But US President Donald Trump sees it very differently. He says China wants global tech dominance and does not care how it is achieved.</p>\n\n<p>Shen Hongyuan, a local Huawei manager, politely declined to answer questions about whether he felt the company\u2019s business was now finished in the US. Again, like Yin from Honeywell, he wanted to stress the positive. \u201cWe hope we can cooperate with other countries,\u201d he said.</p>\n\n<p>In truth, the US has become far less important as a market for Huawei than other parts of the world \u2013 at least in terms of its smartphones.</p>\n\n<blockquote><img src=\"https://timedotcom.files.wordpress.com/2017/04/president-donald-trump-xi-jinping-china.jpg?resize=939%2C578\" alt=\"Image result for trump and xi jinping\" data-iml=\"1558347776348\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\"><p><a href=\"https://timedotcom.files.wordpress.com/2017/04/president-donald-trump-xi-jinping-china.jpg\"> President Donald Trump talks with Chinese President Xi Jinping, with their wives, first lady Melania Trump and Chinese first lady Peng Liyuan as they pose for photographers before dinner at Mar-a-Lago, Thursday, April 6, 2017, in Palm Beach, Fla.<br></a></p></blockquote>\n\n<p>\u201cHuawei has not been able to crack the US market. And that\u2019s where it gets interesting, because \u2026 still, every quarter Huawei is growing at a record rate. So it is still growing in China, and that is spectacular. And the next region it\u2019s growing in is Europe, and Southeast Asia,\u201d Shobhit Srivastava, an India-based analyst at Counterpoint Research, told Al Jazeera by phone.</p>\n\n<p>But it\u2019s the Middle East and Africa where sales of Huawei phones are growing the fastest, recording a 68 percent expansion in the first quarter of this year compared with the same period in 2018, according to Counterpoint.</p>\n\n<p>The research firm says 17 percent of the world\u2019s smartphones were made by Huawei in the first quarter, making it the second-biggest maker behind Samsung and one notch before Apple.</p>\n\n<p>To China\u2019s leadership, the US case against Huawei is connected, driven by bewilderment and jealousy that one company has come so far, so quickly.</p>\n\n<p>But to the Trump administration, Huawei represents all that is wrong with China\u2019s economy \u2013 a success story built on stolen technology.</p>\n\n<p>But, make no mistake, this is serious for Huawei.</p>\n\n<p>Of top concern will be its inclusion on the US Commerce Department\u2019s \u201cEntity List.\u201d This means US firms that sell key components \u2013 like the chips used in Huawei phones \u2013 will have to apply for a license. That is going to make it very difficult for Huawei to do business with any US firm.</p>\n\n<p>Analysts say they are digging in for the long haul.</p>\n\n<blockquote><p><strong>\u201cThe US-China trade conflict shows no sign of de-escalating anytime soon, as the White House banned Huawei from selling equipment to the US market and required US companies to obtain licences in order to sell chips and technology to Huawei,\u201d CMC Markets analyst Margaret Yang said in a research note.</strong></p></blockquote>\n\n<figure><a href=\"https://www.reactorreview.com/?p=2979\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<img src=\"https://i2.wp.com/www.reactorreview.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/09/wall-e-933315_1280.jpg?resize=1080%2C675&amp;ssl=1\" alt=\"Twelve new lenses you won\u2019t be able to live without\">\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</a></figure>\n\n<h2><a href=\"https://www.reactorreview.com/?p=2979\">Twelve new lenses you won\u2019t be able to live without</a></h2>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://twitter.com/intent/tweet?url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.reactorreview.com%2F%3Fp%3D2979&amp;via=FelixMu28970705\" data-size=\"large\">Tweet</a></p>\n\n<p>Oporteat delicata constituam in nec.

Things on the ground are difficult for our people. Immediate and urgent measures need to be instituted and all efforts and energy be re-directed to this devastating situation facing our people,\u201d Kihika said.\n\n\u201cFailure to respond to the situation will be tantamount to fueling the brewing anger and desperation among the people. A situation that can only be catastrophic for our lovely nation.\u201d\n\nKihika urged the government to institute urgent measures that will cushion Kenyans against an economic meltdown caused by the pandemic and worsened by some of the containment measures.\n\nThe situation is even precarious for the zoned counties of Kajiado, Kiambu, Machakos, Nakuru and Nairobi, where the President directed bars to be closed while eateries are only providing takeaway services.\n\n\u201cIn order to meet the stringent IMF conditions attached to these loans approvals, it is imperative that the country embarks on an aggressive programme towards fiscal consolidation driven by growth in revenue in order to sustainably manage both the debt levels and debts serviceability,\u201d the lawmakers said in a joint statement.\n\n\u201cIt is our strong believe that this will be achievable only through the expansion of our taxes and not by overtaxing the existing base of taxpayers.\u201d\n\nThe National Treasury said the newly acquired facility, which is under the IMF\u2019s Extended Credit Facility and Extended Fund Facility, includes an initial disbursement of Sh79 billion, due for release by June 30th, 2021.\n\nTreasury further revealed a total of Sh33.7 billion will be released immediately and will be used for budget support.\n\nCommenting on the approval of the facility, IMF\u2019s Deputy Managing Director and Acting Chair Antoinette Sayeh said the facility will also be used to safeguard resources to protect vulnerable groups\n\nSayeh said the COVID-19 shock has exacerbated the country\u2019s pre-existing fiscal vulnerabilities, but said its debt remains sustainable.\n\nShe however warned that Kenya is at high risk of debt distress.\n\n\u201cTo address debt-related risks, the authorities have taken action to hold the fiscal deficit and debt ratios to 8.7 and 70.4 per cent of GDP, respectively, this fiscal year. Fiscal and balance-of-payments financing needs remain sizable over the medium term,\u201d she said.\n\nReality Check On Future Of Teaching and Learning Post COVID-19 Epidemic\n\nby admin | Mar 18, 2021 | Uncategorized\n\nTweet\n\nEducation is one of the key pillars of development in any country. The main motive of education is to\nimpart knowledge to all learners in a well-defined curriculum.\n\nHowever, with the emergence of Covid-19, education and learning seems to have been highly differentiated and it is important to understand the meaning of the two and look at the future of both. Jeff Cobb, a renowned author of the book Philosophically Speaking defines learning as \u201cthe lifelong\nprocess of transforming information and experience into knowledge, skills, behaviors, and attitudes\u201d.\n\nAccording to him, education is just a small component of learning. In this sense, education and learning are related. However, learning is much broader and does not necessarily dwell on acquisition of knowledge and skills, but emphasises on lifelong transformation. This clearly denotes that learning starts way before we enter education institutions.\n\nIn the pre-Covid period, learning and education seemed to have been equal because learning was synonymous with being physically in school. Online learning was a rare item, especially for secondary and primary school children. In fact, it was almost inconceivable to imagine that learning would happen at home.\n\nFollowing the spread of the pandemic, schools adopted online learning through Zoom, Microsoft Teams and Google Classroom. Many online learning systems started to emerge with some stand-alone\nlearning platforms while others came in as complete Learning Management Systems (LMS), incorporating distance-learning modules.\n\nOf all the systems sampled in the market, LMS offer a very comprehensive approach; similar to web-based platforms for the same category of users. Covid-19 has formalised homeschooling for basic education. A keen look at the curriculum that was proposed for Community Based Learning, shows that the crisis has ushered in a complete transformation in the education sector.\n\nSome of the areas of emphasis are entrepreneurship, financial management, innovations, design thinking, coding and programming, whose intention was to create self-reliant individuals from our learning undertakings. Through the LMS, pupils have also expanded their learning skills. The big question remains, \u201cwhat is the future of learning in Kenya post Covid-19?.\n\nTeachers should be more innovative in delivering content to supplement physical learning. Additionally, the government ought to play a bigger role in policy-making and quality control and leave the management of schools to private entrepreneurs to enhance growth and quality. Examination bodies will also need to find new ways of assessment. Exams will change in terms of both the nature, content and management.\n\nThis will eventually digitise the learner\u2019s portfolio and keep a long-term stage-by-stage performance record of the learners. There should also be a consideration of digital libraries. As part of making learning truly transformative, some old learning areas will start to fade. Key areas to watch will be financial management for youth, entrepreneurship, innovation and design thinking, coding, photography and videography.\n\nEnhanced parent-teacher school engagements should replace a diary that only communicates after the\npupils reach their homes.

The main motive of education is to<br>\nimpart knowledge to all learners in a well-defined curriculum.</p>\n\n<p>However, with the emergence of Covid-19, education and learning seems to have been highly differentiated and it is important to understand the meaning of the two and look at the future of both. Jeff Cobb, a renowned author of the book Philosophically Speaking defines learning as \u201cthe lifelong<br>\nprocess of transforming information and experience into knowledge, skills, behaviors, and attitudes\u201d.</p>\n\n<p>According to him, education is just a small component of learning. In this sense, education and learning are related. However, learning is much broader and does not necessarily dwell on acquisition of knowledge and skills, but emphasises on lifelong transformation. This clearly denotes that learning starts way before we enter education institutions.</p>\n\n<p>In the pre-Covid period, learning and education seemed to have been equal because learning was synonymous with being physically in school. Online learning was a rare item, especially for secondary and primary school children. In fact, it was almost inconceivable to imagine that learning would happen at home.</p>\n\n<p>Following the spread of the pandemic, schools adopted online learning through Zoom, Microsoft Teams and Google Classroom. Many online learning systems started to emerge with some stand-alone<br>\nlearning platforms while others came in as complete Learning Management Systems (LMS), incorporating distance-learning modules.</p>\n\n<p>Of all the systems sampled in the market, LMS offer a very comprehensive approach; similar to web-based platforms for the same category of users. Covid-19 has formalised homeschooling for basic education. A keen look at the curriculum that was proposed for Community Based Learning, shows that the crisis has ushered in a complete transformation in the education sector.</p>\n\n<p>Some of the areas of emphasis are entrepreneurship, financial management, innovations, design thinking, coding and programming, whose intention was to create self-reliant individuals from our learning undertakings. Through the LMS, pupils have also expanded their learning skills. The big question remains, \u201cwhat is the future of learning in Kenya post Covid-19?.</p>\n\n<p>Teachers should be more innovative in delivering content to supplement physical learning. Additionally, the government ought to play a bigger role in policy-making and quality control and leave the management of schools to private entrepreneurs to enhance growth and quality. Examination bodies will also need to find new ways of assessment. Exams will change in terms of both the nature, content and management.</p>\n\n<p>This will eventually digitise the learner\u2019s portfolio and keep a long-term stage-by-stage performance record of the learners. There should also be a consideration of digital libraries. As part of making learning truly transformative, some old learning areas will start to fade. Key areas to watch will be financial management for youth, entrepreneurship, innovation and design thinking, coding, photography and videography.</p>\n\n<p>Enhanced parent-teacher school engagements should replace a diary that only communicates after the<br>\npupils reach their homes. In conclusion, learning will change drastically. This is not just in learning institutions but the same dynamics that apply across various sectors, business lines and even the social or nonprofit-based institutions.</p>\n\n<figure><a href=\"https://www.reactorreview.com/?p=28240\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<img src=\"https://i2.wp.com/www.reactorreview.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/unnamed-34.jpg?resize=512%2C373&amp;ssl=1\" alt=\"DRAMA as  Sonko\u2019s new Lawyer, Khaminwa walks out of court during the hearing\">\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</a></figure>\n\n<h2><a href=\"https://www.reactorreview.com/?p=28240\">DRAMA as  Sonko\u2019s new Lawyer, Khaminwa walks out of court during the hearing</a></h2>\n\n<p>by <a href=\"https://www.reactorreview.com/?author=1\" title=\"Posts by admin\">admin</a> | Mar 16, 2021 | <a href=\"https://www.reactorreview.com/?cat=1\">Uncategorized</a></p>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://twitter.com/intent/tweet?url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.reactorreview.com%2F%3Fp%3D28240&amp;via=FelixMu28970705\" data-size=\"large\">Tweet</a></p>\n\n<p>Lawyer John Khaminwa has walked out of court during the hearing of former Nairobi Governor Mike Sonko\u2019s corruption case.</p>\n\n<p>Khaminwa cited bias in the form of not being furnished with the proper documents as the reason for walking out of the proceedings, while also questioning the decision by the court to exclude media from coverage.</p>\n\n<p>\u201cI have left the courtroom.

This is after it dawned on them the initial June date was no longer realistic.\n\nThey cited the delay by the Nation al Assembly and the Senate to pass the bill. And now some of the BBI bill promoters are pushing for reopening of the report, a move that will definitely derail the process further. The BBI bill had earlier been tabled before county assemblies and received overwhelming support. The assemblies complied with Article 257 of the Constitution which outlines a\nroadmap of amending the Constitution through the popular initiative.\n\nUnder this law, the hands of the legislative bodies, both at county and national levels are tied. They have no power to alter or add a coma or fullstop to a bill that originates from views of the people. The county assemblies had two options: to either adopt or reject the bill submitted to them by the Independent Electoral and Boundaries Commission.\n\nThe National Assembly and the Senate had a similar role. However, even if the two Houses rejected the original BBI bill, it wouldn\u2019t stop the IEBC from going ahead with referendum plans. Kenyans will have the final say.\n\nPresident Uhuru Kenyatta and his Handshake partner Raila Odinga are the key drivers of the BBI process. However, going by latest political events, it seems one or both of them has/have changed mind. They no longer lead the BBI process with same vigour and energy they exhibited at the start of the journey.\n\nBesides their allies are now rooting for the reopening of bill and if they have eventually have their way, then the BBI bill would no longer be a popular document. Well, one of the key proposals that the MPs, who are pushing for the reopening of BBI report, are uncomfortable with is that of increasing the number of constituencies. Central Kenya is highly populated and hence it is set to receive the lion\u2019s share of the 70 additional parliamentary seats.\n\nThe BBI bill has no clause suggesting the power to create new electoral units would be taken away from IEBC. Once adopted, the commission will still exercise this power.

This is after it dawned on them the initial June date was no longer realistic.</p>\n\n<p>They cited the delay by the Nation al Assembly and the Senate to pass the bill. And now some of the BBI bill promoters are pushing for reopening of the report, a move that will definitely derail the process further. The BBI bill had earlier been tabled before county assemblies and received overwhelming support. The assemblies complied with Article 257 of the Constitution which outlines a<br>\nroadmap of amending the Constitution through the popular initiative.</p>\n\n<p>Under this law, the hands of the legislative bodies, both at county and national levels are tied. They have no power to alter or add a coma or fullstop to a bill that originates from views of the people. The county assemblies had two options: to either adopt or reject the bill submitted to them by the Independent Electoral and Boundaries Commission.</p>\n\n<p>The National Assembly and the Senate had a similar role. However, even if the two Houses rejected the original BBI bill, it wouldn\u2019t stop the IEBC from going ahead with referendum plans. Kenyans will have the final say.</p>\n\n<p>President Uhuru Kenyatta and his Handshake partner Raila Odinga are the key drivers of the BBI process. However, going by latest political events, it seems one or both of them has/have changed mind. They no longer lead the BBI process with same vigour and energy they exhibited at the start of the journey.</p>\n\n<p>Besides their allies are now rooting for the reopening of bill and if they have eventually have their way, then the BBI bill would no longer be a popular document. Well, one of the key proposals that the MPs, who are pushing for the reopening of BBI report, are uncomfortable with is that of increasing the number of constituencies. Central Kenya is highly populated and hence it is set to receive the lion\u2019s share of the 70 additional parliamentary seats.</p>\n\n<p>The BBI bill has no clause suggesting the power to create new electoral units would be taken away from IEBC. Once adopted, the commission will still exercise this power. In the event that the document is reopened, we would result in two documents, one passed by county assemblies and the amended version endorsed by two Houses of Parliament.</p>\n\n<p>So which bill will be presented to Kenyans at the referendum? Further, this would give the anti BBI team more grounds to challenge the legality of the process in court. One wonders why the same proponents of the constitution amendment initiative would want to offend the same supreme law of the land they seek to make better.</p>\n\n<p>Remember how Raila allies repeatedly countered the narrative of cost of a referendum, arguing that Kenyans stand to gain more if BBI sailed through? What has changed? Kenyans deserve better leadership, please!</p>\n\n</article>", "canonicalUrl": "https://www.reactorreview.com/?p=28943"},{"url": "https://www.reactorreview.com/?p=28819", "probability": 0.98264045, "headline": "Politics Aside, Myriad Challenges Bedevil Africa", "datePublished": "2021-04-14T00:00:00", "datePublishedRaw": "Apr 14, 2021", "dateModified": "2021-04-14T05:57:26+00:00", "dateModifiedRaw": "2021-04-14T05:57:26+00:00", "inLanguage": "en", "mainImage": "https://i2.wp.com/www.reactorreview.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/IMG_20210414_085144.jpg?fit=832%2C579&ssl=1", "images": ["https://i2.wp.com/www.reactorreview.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/IMG_20210414_085144.jpg?resize=832%2C579&ssl=1", "https://secure.gravatar.com/avatar/79818052b835414a173c0dadcc9e9f44?s=150&d=mm&r=g"], "description": "It is now firmly established that the Covid-19 pandemic has trumped politics locally and globally, forcibly directing focus to the critical challenges confronting humanity today.

This has been compounded by disrupted supply chains, limiting access to intermediate goods, labor, and sales channels. Local businesses also face weaker access to cash and credit. Lastly, uncertainty is dampening prospects for investment and innovation.\n\nThe negative impact of COVID-19 on the private sector has trickled down to household welfare via reduced job opportunities and lower earnings. Unemployment has almost doubled compared to its pre-COVID level. Wage workers\u2013and especially women\u2013who are still employed face a reduction in working hours and earnings.\n\nAlmost 1 in 3 household-run businesses are not operating currently, with revenues decreasing across all sectors. Remittances have fallen, and few households have benefitted from direct cash assistance. Youth are also negatively affected by the pandemic, with revenues and profits strongly reduced for micro-enterprises run by young entrepreneurs, with only a few of them making use of government and non-governmental organizations (NGO) support programs.\n\n\u201cKenya has made considerable progress with poverty reduction over the last years, but COVID-19 has destroyed the livelihoods of many Kenyans, pushing an estimated two million people into poverty,\u201d said Utz Pape, World Bank Senior Economist in the Poverty & Equity Global Practice of the World Bank. \u201cA swift and well-targeted response is needed to protect livelihoods and avoid trapping more people in long-term poverty.\u201d\n\nThe report also notes human capital losses, as only a few children have had access to their teachers during school closures and continued to be involved in meaningful educational activities, something that especially rural and vulnerable households struggle with. Access to healthcare has also been significantly impeded, with three in 10 households reporting less access to healthcare than before the pandemic.\n\nPolicy options to protect businesses and households\n\nFor firms, the report recommends four buckets of policy responses: supporting the liquidity of viable firms, enhancing firms\u2019 digital capabilities, improving access to information, and improving targeting criteria for interventions to support businesses. For households, the Kenya Economic Update emphasizes the need to secure access to food, while supporting livelihoods through social protection programs to reduce the usage of negative coping strategies compromising assets or food consumption.\n\nDespite the urgency of making such support available on a larger scale, a well-targeted approach is essential to limit fiscal costs. For example, a targeted cash transfer of KSh 20,000 to poor households would require a budget of KSh 50 billion, equal to the cost of the value-added tax relief enacted by the government.\n\nSuch a cash transfer program could reach 2.5 million poor, more than offsetting the increase of poverty by COVID-19.

The deaths took place on 1 January, 2008, and four suspects were charged two months later but Justice David Maraga said he had to drop the case, citing lack of evidence and shoddy police investigations.\n\nBack in 2016, when appearing before MPs for vetting, then Chief Justice nominee David Maraga struggled to explain himself against allegations he failed to serve justice in the famous judgement.\n\nWhen he appeared before MPs for vetting, Justice Maraga was pressed to explain his decision not to convict anyone during the attack on Kiambaa church at the height of the 2007/2008 post-election violence.\n\nUnder intense questioning by the Justice and Legal Affairs Committee led by then Ainabkoi MP Samuel Chepkonga, the judge stood his ground.\nCommittee vice-person Priscilla Nyokabi (Nyeri County MP) raised the matter of Kiambaa Church arson case and demanded to know why the suspects were acquitted.\n\nJustice Maraga said: \u201cI handled the\u2026 Kiambaa at the\u2026 time. Our judgement is not based on emotions but on evidence and the law. I also lamented over poor investigations. There was no evidence to sustain a conviction.\u201d\n\nUnchartered Territory! Uncertain future for Chad as slain leader\u2019s son takes power\n\nby admin | Apr 21, 2021 | News, World\n\nChad woke up to an uncertain future on Wednesday as the son of slain president Idriss Deby Itno took charge following the death of his father, who had ruled the country with an iron fist for three decades.\n\nThe presidency moved swiftly to put the reins of power in the hands of General Mahamat Idriss Deby Itno and tear up Chad\u2019s constitution, establishing a \u201cTransition Charter\u201d that lays out a new basic law for the desert country of 16 million people.\n\nThe new charter issued Wednesday proclaimed that Mahamat 37, a career soldier like his father, will \u201coccupy the functions of the president of the republic\u201d and also serve as head of the armed forces.\n\nMahamat had already been named the head of a military council on Tuesday soon after the announcement of Deby\u2019s death in combat, a move that sidelined other political institutions in Chad and has been branded a coup d\u2019etat by opposition groups.\n\nDeby, 68, died only a day after provisional results declared him the winner of an April 11 election giving him a sixth term in office.\n\nThe outcome was never in serious doubt, with a divided opposition, boycott calls, and a campaign in which demonstrations were banned or dispersed.\n\nThe military council has already dissolved parliament and the government, and been tasked with leading an 18-month transition period ahead of new \u201cfree and democratic\u201d elections.\n\nAnxious Western powers including Chad\u2019s former colonial master France have called for a peaceful transition that paves the way for a civilian government.\n\n\u2013 Rebel incursion \u2013\n\nThe West has lost a key partner in its anti-jihadist campaign in the unstable Sahel region particularly due to the relative strength of Chad\u2019s military and its ability to supply weaponry and soldiers.\n\nHis demise came only days after the army had claimed a \u201cgreat victory\u201d against fighters from the Front for Change and Concord in Chad (FACT) who had launched an incursion from Libya on the same day as the presidential election.\n\nDeby, a herder\u2019s son who took power on the back of a coup in 1990, had on previous occasions gone to the frontlines as government forces battled rebels.\n\nThe military said Monday it had killed more than 300 rebels and captured 150 others, with the loss of five soldiers.\n\nBut FACT spokesman Kingabe Ogouzeimi de Tapol told AFP on Tuesday that the rebels would pursue their offensive after a pause for Deby\u2019s state funeral on Friday.\n\n\u201cWe categorically reject the transition,\u201d he said. \u201cOur troops are en route towards N\u2019Djamena.\u201d\n\nGun-toting soldiers in fatigues and members of the red-bereted presidential guard were seen patrolling the capital in the aftermath of Deby\u2019s death.\n\nBut on Wednesday, banks, markets and most shops were open while the national flag flew at half-mast on public buildings.\n\n\u2013 \u2018Security crossroads\u2019 \u2013\n\nAnalysts warned that Deby\u2019s passing threatened to bring more instability to a region where jihadist groups are gaining in strength.\n\n\u201cChad is at a critical security crossroads for the whole of the African continent and for many years now has been not just a staunch Western ally but an effective security partner,\u201d said Cameron Hudson, a senior fellow and Africa expert at the Atlantic Council think-tank.\n\nFrance, which has a force of 5,100 in the Sahel region, said it insisted on the \u201cstability and territorial integrity\u201d of Chad in the face of the rebel push towards the capital.\n\nThe French presidency also underscored \u201cthe importance of the transition taking place under peaceful conditions\u201d.\n\nThere should also be \u201ca spirit of dialogue with all political and civil society actors, and allowing the rapid return to inclusive governance based on civil institutions,\u201d it added.\n\nBoth the United States and the European Union also offered condolences and urged a peaceful transition of power.\n\nUN chief Antonio Guterres said Deby was a \u201ckey partner\u201d and had made significant contributions to help \u201ccombat terrorism, violent extremism and organised crime in the Sahel\u201d.\n\nOne analyst said the country was \u201centering uncharted territory\u201d.\n\n\u201cA damaging succession crisis is to be feared, while government forces and rebels have been fighting each other in the north and centre of the country,\u201d said Richard Moncrieff of the International Crisis Group think tank.\n\nNew twist as Royal Media Services Boss SK Macharia\u2019s security is Withdrawn\n\nby admin | Apr 21, 2021 | News\n\nRoyal Media Services boss SK Macharia\u2019s bodyguards and the security manning the gates of his media house (Citizen Tv) has been withdrawn.\n\nSources at the media house alleged that the Wednesday morning, April 21, 2021 incidence was done with a motive of retaliating against Citizen TV\u2019s investigative feature, Gun Galore (Silaha Mtaani) by reporter Purity Mwambia.\n\n\u201cThe administration police are who are stationed at the gate work in two shifts, during the day and during the night. They did not report to duty.\n\n\u201cThose attached to SK Macharia were also withdrawn,\u201d the sources said.\n\nThe move has raised concerns over the safety of the media house boss, its staff and the investigative reporter, Purity Mwambia.\n\nThis comes after the Directorate of Criminal Investigations (DCI) George Kinoti on Tuesday, April 20, 2021 announced that he would summon Purity Mwambia and some Senior Officials from Citizen Tv over Gun Galore report.\n\nThe DCI boss claimed that the media house did not consult the police or relevant stakeholders before airing the piece.\n\n\u201cThe allegations made in this report are extremely serious. It is also apparent that crimes relating to unlawful possession of firearms may have been committed in the context of this report.\n\n\u201cWe never refused to any operations being carried by you. This could be a fantastic operation if at least you could have put us on board. The moment you have received a piece of information where we can recover a firearm, please don\u2019t be cheated it was okay to be done the way it was done. It was dangerous,\u201d Kinoti said.\n\nThe Citizen Tv investigative reporters handed the exhibits collected in the report, among them an AK 47 gun, a pistol, handcuffs and police uniform to the police.\n\nHowever, the Media Council of Kenya (MCK) defended the Media house from the DCI summons saying that it expected the police to investigate the matter rather than violate freedom of the press and access to information.\n\n\u201cIn this case where the media has exposed weaknesses among some elements in the National Police Service (NPS), natural justice demands that the same service cannot then purport to investigate or otherwise summon the journalists.\n\n\u201cInstead, efforts should be put toward finding out how their members are providing civilians with guns, bullets, uniforms and handcuffs. Summoning journalists to reveal their sources is a violation of press freedom,\u201d MCK wrote in a press statement dated Tuesday, April 20, 2021.\n\nDP Ruto\u2019s presidency bid in jeopardy; Kenyans unmask his circles of Evil\n\nby admin | Apr 21, 2021 | News\n\nTweet\n\nWilliam Ruto is an evil genius, he\u2019s a dictator and all around surrounded by thugs and hard-boiled fans.\n\nThis was very clear from a top trending hashtag #KarenCirclesOfEvil, where angry Kenyans have strongly called out DP Ruto criminal associates.\n\nKenyans on Twitter, popularly known as KOT, have over the past decade built a reputation as bulldogs in their own capacity. Not only are they ferocious when mocked, but they are also sharp and fierce with their opinions, ensuring the voice of Kenyans is heard loud and clear.\n\nFrom Kimwarer to Arror, to fake guns scandal, to Weston, to Muteshi land, to drugs, to murder, to money laundering in Tanzania to fake Gold scandal, the enraged KOT unmasked all the dirt in Ruto\u2019s closet.\n\nAnd it was obvious that the second in command is surrounded by the most dubious of persons accused of the worst crimes and yet he want to lead Kenya.\n\nIronically DP Ruto has carefully crafted an image of a clean-cut, staunch Christian. He is said to be a teetotaller, waking up at 4am daily to pray, and never misses a Sunday service, \u201cdespite his busy schedule\u201d.\n\nRuto\u2019s other public persona is that of a \u201chustler\u201d. In interviews, he has spoken of his \u201cordinary\u201d peasant upbringing of herding cows and selling chicken during the weekends and holidays to raise money for family needs.\n\nBut in recent years, stubborn questions regarding the source of his vast wealth refuse to go away and Kenyans online today have unmasked DP\u2019s associates who have oiled his campaigns in the recent times.\n\nOne netizen noted that Ruto is not only notorious thief siphoning public resources but also a cold blood murderer. He murdered the likes of Jacob Juma, Meshack Yebei, John Kituyi among other very many innocent Kenyans in cold blood\n\nAnother indicated that William Ruto\u2019s chemistry with rogue members in our society is unmatched.

Boda boda gang shoots, kills KDF officer in Utawala\n\nby admin | Apr 21, 2021 | News\n\nA Kenya Defense Forces (KDF) soldier was on Tuesday night shot and killed by a motorcycle gang in Utawala, Nairobi.\n\nThe soldier, who was on his way home, was accosted at around 8pm by a gang of three on a boda boda who demanded his backpack.\n\nPolice said a scuffle ensued before one of the attackers shot senior private Joseph Mwangi before grabbing his rucksack and rode off with his accomplices.\n\nGuards at nearby houses heard the gunshot and rushed to the scene and rushed the 30-year-old soldier to a nearby hospital where he was pronounced dead on arrival.\n\nAccording to police crime scene investigators, who were sent to the scene, no spent cartridge was recovered despite the single bullet entering and exiting his lower abdomen.\n\nPolice are still trying to establish what the backpack contained as they hunt down the gang.\n\nThe body was later moved to the mortuary to await a postmortem examination.\n\nPolice have advised the public not to resist orders from armed thugs whenever they are accosted, to ensure their safety.\n\nCases of armed robberies have been on the increase in Nairobi during the Covid-19 pandemic, with the attacks blamed on illegal guns in the hands of criminals.", "articleBodyHtml": "<article>\n\n<figure><a href=\"https://www.reactorreview.com/?p=28992\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<img src=\"https://i0.wp.com/www.reactorreview.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/PEV_victims.jpg.771x441_q85_crop-smart.jpg?resize=450%2C299&amp;ssl=1\" alt=\"Leave Fred Ngatia alone, even Maraga acquitted Kiambaa Church massacre perpetrator- Shamalla\">\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</a></figure>\n\n<p>Popular Nominated MP Jennifer Shamalla yesterday moved to throw a spanner in the works as regarding debate on Lawyer Fred Nga\u2019tia who, hours earlier, had been interviewed for the Chief Justice position by the Judicial Service Commission\u2019s vetting panel.</p>\n\n<p>Jennifer Shamalla dismissed fears expressed by Ngatia\u2019s critics who are concerned that since he has acted as a lawyer for Uhuru in the past, this might make him an unsuitable Chief Justice, citing possible bias.</p>\n\n<p>Speaking yesterday on KTN News\u2019 political show NewsNight hosted by Ben Kitili, Jennifer Shamalla reminded the rest that even former Chief Justice David Maraga, who is now hailed as a model Chief Justice by many, had his own unsavory past.</p>\n\n<p>Referring to a ruling Maraga made when he was still a High Court judge in Nakuru, Shamalla said it should be remembered that Maraga freed four suspects who were accused of burning the Kiambaa Church during the 2007-08 post-election violence.</p>\n\n<p>Thousands of civilians, including women and children, died when marauding militias set fire to the Kenya Assemblies of God church in the northern city of Eldoret, where they were sheltering from the clashes. The deaths took place on 1 January, 2008, and four suspects were charged two months later but Justice David Maraga said he had to drop the case, citing lack of evidence and shoddy police investigations.</p>\n\n<p>Back in 2016, when appearing before MPs for vetting, then Chief Justice nominee David Maraga struggled to explain himself against allegations he failed to serve justice in the famous judgement.</p>\n\n<p>When he appeared before MPs for vetting, Justice Maraga was pressed to explain his decision not to convict anyone during the attack on Kiambaa church at the height of the 2007/2008 post-election violence.</p>\n\n<p>Under intense questioning by the Justice and Legal Affairs Committee led by then Ainabkoi MP Samuel Chepkonga, the judge stood his ground.<br>\nCommittee vice-person Priscilla Nyokabi (Nyeri County MP) raised the matter of Kiambaa Church arson case and demanded to know why the suspects were acquitted.</p>\n\n<p>Justice Maraga said: \u201cI handled the\u2026 Kiambaa at the\u2026 time. Our judgement is not based on emotions but on evidence and the law. I also lamented over poor investigations. There was no evidence to sustain a conviction.\u201d</p>\n\n<figure><a href=\"https://www.reactorreview.com/?p=28989\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<img src=\"https://i0.wp.com/www.reactorreview.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/SEC_75455505.jpg?resize=644%2C338&amp;ssl=1\" alt=\"Unchartered Territory!

href=\"https://www.reactorreview.com/?cat=8\">News</a>, <a href=\"https://www.reactorreview.com/?cat=111\">World</a></p>\n\n<p>Chad woke up to an uncertain future on Wednesday as the son of slain president Idriss Deby Itno took charge following the death of his father, who had ruled the country with an iron fist for three decades.</p>\n\n<p>The presidency moved swiftly to put the reins of power in the hands of General Mahamat Idriss Deby Itno and tear up Chad\u2019s constitution, establishing a \u201cTransition Charter\u201d that lays out a new basic law for the desert country of 16 million people.</p>\n\n<p>The new charter issued Wednesday proclaimed that Mahamat 37, a career soldier like his father, will \u201coccupy the functions of the president of the republic\u201d and also serve as head of the armed forces.</p>\n\n<p>Mahamat had already been named the head of a military council on Tuesday soon after the announcement of Deby\u2019s death in combat, a move that sidelined other political institutions in Chad and has been branded a coup d\u2019etat by opposition groups.</p>\n\n<p>Deby, 68, died only a day after provisional results declared him the winner of an April 11 election giving him a sixth term in office.</p>\n\n<p>The outcome was never in serious doubt, with a divided opposition, boycott calls, and a campaign in which demonstrations were banned or dispersed.</p>\n\n<p>The military council has already dissolved parliament and the government, and been tasked with leading an 18-month transition period ahead of new \u201cfree and democratic\u201d elections.</p>\n\n<p>Anxious Western powers including Chad\u2019s former colonial master France have called for a peaceful transition that paves the way for a civilian government.</p>\n\n<p>\u2013 Rebel incursion \u2013</p>\n\n<p>The West has lost a key partner in its anti-jihadist campaign in the unstable Sahel region particularly due to the relative strength of Chad\u2019s military and its ability to supply weaponry and soldiers.</p>\n\n<p>His demise came only days after the army had claimed a \u201cgreat victory\u201d against fighters from the Front for Change and Concord in Chad (FACT) who had launched an incursion from Libya on the same day as the presidential election.</p>\n\n<p>Deby, a herder\u2019s son who took power on the back of a coup in 1990, had on previous occasions gone to the frontlines as government forces battled rebels.</p>\n\n<p>The military said Monday it had killed more than 300 rebels and captured 150 others, with the loss of five soldiers.</p>\n\n<p>But FACT spokesman Kingabe Ogouzeimi de Tapol told AFP on Tuesday that the rebels would pursue their offensive after a pause for Deby\u2019s state funeral on Friday.</p>\n\n<p>\u201cWe categorically reject the transition,\u201d he said. \u201cOur troops are en route towards N\u2019Djamena.\u201d</p>\n\n<p>Gun-toting soldiers in fatigues and members of the red-bereted presidential guard were seen patrolling the capital in the aftermath of Deby\u2019s death.</p>\n\n<p>But on Wednesday, banks, markets and most shops were open while the national flag flew at half-mast on public buildings.</p>\n\n<p>\u2013 \u2018Security crossroads\u2019 \u2013</p>\n\n<p>Analysts warned that Deby\u2019s passing threatened to bring more instability to a region where jihadist groups are gaining in strength.</p>\n\n<p>\u201cChad is at a critical security crossroads for the whole of the African continent and for many years now has been not just a staunch Western ally but an effective security partner,\u201d said Cameron Hudson, a senior fellow and Africa expert at the Atlantic Council think-tank.</p>\n\n<p>France, which has a force of 5,100 in the Sahel region, said it insisted on the \u201cstability and territorial integrity\u201d of Chad in the face of the rebel push towards the capital.</p>\n\n<p>The French presidency also underscored \u201cthe importance of the transition taking place under peaceful conditions\u201d.</p>\n\n<p>There should also be \u201ca spirit of dialogue with all political and civil society actors, and allowing the rapid return to inclusive governance based on civil institutions,\u201d it added.</p>\n\n<p>Both the United States and the European Union also offered condolences and urged a peaceful transition of power.</p>\n\n<p>UN chief Antonio Guterres said Deby was a \u201ckey partner\u201d and had made significant contributions to help \u201ccombat terrorism, violent extremism and organised crime in the Sahel\u201d.</p>\n\n<p>One analyst said the country was \u201centering uncharted territory\u201d.</p>\n\n<p>\u201cA damaging succession crisis is to be feared, while government forces and rebels have been fighting each other in the north and centre of the country,\u201d said Richard Moncrieff of the International Crisis Group think tank.</p>\n\n<figure><a

href=\"https://www.reactorreview.com/?cat=8\">News</a></p>\n\n<p>Royal Media Services boss SK Macharia\u2019s bodyguards and the security manning the gates of his media house (Citizen Tv) has been withdrawn.</p>\n\n<p>Sources at the media house alleged that the Wednesday morning, April 21, 2021 incidence was done with a motive of retaliating against Citizen TV\u2019s investigative feature, Gun Galore (Silaha Mtaani) by reporter Purity Mwambia.</p>\n\n<p>\u201cThe administration police are who are stationed at the gate work in two shifts, during the day and during the night. They did not report to duty.</p>\n\n<p>\u201cThose attached to SK Macharia were also withdrawn,\u201d the sources said.</p>\n\n<p>The move has raised concerns over the safety of the media house boss, its staff and the investigative reporter, Purity Mwambia.</p>\n\n<p>This comes after the Directorate of Criminal Investigations (DCI) George Kinoti on Tuesday, April 20, 2021 announced that he would summon Purity Mwambia and some Senior Officials from Citizen Tv over Gun Galore report.</p>\n\n<p>The DCI boss claimed that the media house did not consult the police or relevant stakeholders before airing the piece.</p>\n\n<p>\u201cThe allegations made in this report are extremely serious. It is also apparent that crimes relating to unlawful possession of firearms may have been committed in the context of this report.</p>\n\n<p>\u201cWe never refused to any operations being carried by you. This could be a fantastic operation if at least you could have put us on board. The moment you have received a piece of information where we can recover a firearm, please don\u2019t be cheated it was okay to be done the way it was done. It was dangerous,\u201d Kinoti said.</p>\n\n<p>The Citizen Tv investigative reporters handed the exhibits collected in the report, among them an AK 47 gun, a pistol, handcuffs and police uniform to the police.</p>\n\n<p>However, the Media Council of Kenya (MCK) defended the Media house from the DCI summons saying that it expected the police to investigate the matter rather than violate freedom of the press and access to information.</p>\n\n<p>\u201cIn this case where the media has exposed weaknesses among some elements in the National Police Service (NPS), natural justice demands that the same service cannot then purport to investigate or otherwise summon the journalists.</p>\n\n<p>\u201cInstead, efforts should be put toward finding out how their members are providing civilians with guns, bullets, uniforms and handcuffs. Summoning journalists to reveal their sources is a violation of press freedom,\u201d MCK wrote in a press statement dated Tuesday, April 20, 2021.</p>\n\n<figure><a href=\"https://www.reactorreview.com/?p=28983\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<img src=\"https://i1.wp.com/www.reactorreview.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/Ezd8PdLWEAcbTo9-1.jpg?resize=857%2C675&amp;ssl=1\" alt=\"DP Ruto\u2019s presidency bid in jeopardy; Kenyans unmask his circles of Evil\">\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</a></figure>\n\n<h2><a href=\"https://www.reactorreview.com/?p=28983\">DP Ruto\u2019s presidency bid in jeopardy; Kenyans unmask his circles of Evil</a></h2>\n\n<p>by <a href=\"https://www.reactorreview.com/?author=1\" title=\"Posts by admin\">admin</a> | Apr 21, 2021 | <a href=\"https://www.reactorreview.com/?cat=8\">News</a></p>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://twitter.com/intent/tweet?url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.reactorreview.com%2F%3Fp%3D28983&amp;via=FelixMu28970705\" data-size=\"large\">Tweet</a></p>\n\n<p>William Ruto is an evil genius, he\u2019s a dictator and all around surrounded by thugs and hard-boiled fans.</p>\n\n<p>This was very clear from a top trending hashtag #KarenCirclesOfEvil, where angry Kenyans have strongly called out DP Ruto criminal associates.</p>\n\n<p>Kenyans on Twitter, popularly known as KOT, have over the past decade built a reputation as bulldogs in their own capacity. Not only are they ferocious when mocked, but they are also sharp and fierce with their opinions, ensuring the voice of Kenyans is heard loud and clear.</p>\n\n<p>From Kimwarer to Arror, to fake guns scandal, to Weston, to Muteshi land, to drugs, to murder, to money laundering in Tanzania to fake Gold scandal, the enraged KOT unmasked all the dirt in Ruto\u2019s closet.</p>\n\n<p>And it was obvious that the second in command is surrounded by the most dubious of persons accused of the worst crimes and yet he want to lead Kenya.</p>\n\n<p>Ironically DP Ruto has carefully crafted an image of a clean-cut, staunch Christian. He is said to be a teetotaller, waking up at 4am daily to pray, and never misses a Sunday service, \u201cdespite his busy schedule\u201d.</p>\n\n<p>Ruto\u2019s other public persona is that of a \u201chustler\u201d. In interviews, he has spoken of his \u201cordinary\u201d peasant upbringing of herding cows and selling chicken during the weekends and holidays to raise money for family needs.</p>\n\n<p>But in recent years, stubborn questions regarding the source of his vast wealth refuse to go away and Kenyans online today have unmasked DP\u2019s associates who have oiled his campaigns in the recent times.</p>\n\n<p>One netizen noted that Ruto is not only notorious thief siphoning public resources but also a cold blood murderer. He murdered the likes of Jacob Juma, Meshack Yebei, John Kituyi among other very many innocent Kenyans in cold blood</p>\n\n<p>Another indicated that William Ruto\u2019s chemistry with rogue members in our society is unmatched. Ex governor Waititu a corrupt suspect is Ruto\u2019s friend, disgraced Sonko an ex-convict and thief is Ruto\u2019s friend. Obado murdered Sharon &amp; also a thief is Ruto\u2019s friend.
