Pamoja African Alliance (PAA) would back Raila Odinga\u2019s presidential bid has sparked a debate among leaders.\n\nLast week, Governor Amason Kingi endorsed the Orange Democratic Movement (ODM) leader as his preferred presidential candidate in the 2022 general election but requested that ODM should not field candidates in Kilifi.\n\nKilifi County ODM chairman and Ganze MP Teddy Mwambire have now claimed the announcement caused confusion.\n\nYesterday, Mwambire, who took over as ODM chairman after Governor Kingi was dropped from the position, said PAA should be prepared to compete for political seats with ODM as none will be reserved for it as the governor demanded.\n\nUmoja Summit Party of Kenya (USPK) chairman Matano Chengo and his Kadu Asili counterpart Joshua Kombora claimed it was pointless for Governor Kingi to declare support for Raila\u2019s presidential bid before signing a pre-election pact with him.\n\n\u201cIt is hard for Kingi to negotiate on behalf of the Coast people and sign a pre-election agreement because he has already publicly backed Raila unconditionally,\u201d said Chengo.\n\nHe noted that Coast parties were focused on achieving unity of the region before they could go into a political coalition with any leader.\n\nKombora said parties with roots from the Coast region were treating Kingi\u2019s support for Raila as a personal stand since he has not consulted other parties and residents.\n\n\u201cGovernor Kingi made a personal statement, and he has a right to do so. He has acted unilaterally because he has not consulted us. He can go to Raila with a coalition agreement as Kingi and PAA, but we are not part of that political deal,\u201d Kombora said.\n\nA similar position was shared by Shirikisho Party of Kenya (SPK) secretary-general Adam Mbeto who claimed Governor Kingi and PAA were working alone.\n\nBut PAA national chairman Ibrahim Khamis alias Babangida said, although the party leadership has not made a formal deal with Raila, it was considering taking that political route.\n\nBabangida hinted that PAA could soon enter into a formal engagement with ODM and told other political parties from the Coast region to wait for the outcome.\n\n\u201cThere is no formal engagement yet on Raila\u2019s presidential bid. But it is a political direction we are considering to take,\u201d Babangida said.\nMwambire claimed Governor Kingi was getting confused after he left ODM and appeared to be slowly coming back to the party with unrealistic conditions for supporting Raila.\n\n\u201cHe should know that Kilifi County is firmly an ODM zone. He should join us and campaign for Raila at the national level unconditionally,\u201d Mwambire said.\n\nHe said that it was only in ODM where Coast region interests such as land reforms could be addressed and not PAA that Kingi founded recently.\n\nHe noted PAA party lacked the political muscle and goodwill to tackle Coast issues.\n\nPAA party got a registration certificate on October 18 this year.\n\n\u201cWhat he is talking about right now amounts to confusion since all our local issues will be taken care of in ODM. People are already isolating him. By next year he will have lost his political charm after his term as governor ends,\u201d Mwambire argued.\n\nODM secretary-general Edwin Sifuna rubbished the claims that PAA was contemplating launching talks with Azimio la Umoja and ODM for a possible coalition, saying that the Kingi was desperately seeking relevance after his retirement next year.\n\n\u201cKilifi is an ODM county, and we will field candidates in all elective positions.

Some businesses that were once market leaders are now a pale shadow of their former selves and behind their failures lie key lessons.\n\nSome, however, have known of ways to stay in the market through innovation. Take the example of Amazon whose core business is online shopping. It has since diversified and today produces television shows and offers web services.\n\nThe success behind the Amazon Brand is ideation, incubation and scaling. Every business idea that their employee comes up with is looked into carefully and if deemed as of potential, the next phase is incubation, where it is tried on customers and if seen as a success, it is scaled.\n\nNot many companies take such experiments or the gamble to try an idea and that\u2019s how innovation dies or a business closes shop for good. Here are five examples of failed businesses whose stories would be reading differently today.\n\nNokia and Blackberry\n\nThe two were market leaders in their eras. Many have nostalgia for the iconic Nokia cellular phones that were noted for their long battery life but did not have features like the current makes of smartphones in the market.\n\nNokia would still be a market leader in cellular phones had it focused on software development with the coming of the internet instead of focusing on the hardware. By focusing on the voice, the company began its gradual decline and their comeback attempt with a smartphone was not a successful one owing to the phone\u2019s operating system that had a bad user experience.\n\nBlackberry phones can be remembered by their keyboards that one had to key in manually but they failed to innovate by launching products with touch screens and this ate into their market share.\n\nBlockbuster\n\nThey say that the customer is always right. Blockbuster should have listened to its clients. As a leader in entertainment content, Blockbuster, which had successfully transitioned from VHS to DVD, loved it when customers would stream in their brick and mortar stores and did not entertain the notion of shipping the customers\u2019 orders. Netflix capitalized on this and ate on the traditional Blockbuster market share.\n\nHad Blockbuster partnered with its competitor, it would be in business today.

Some businesses that were once market leaders are now a pale shadow of their former selves and behind their failures lie key lessons.</p>\n\n<p>Some, however, have known of ways to stay in the market through innovation. Take the example of Amazon whose core business is online shopping. It has since diversified and today produces television shows and offers web services.</p>\n\n<p>The success behind the Amazon Brand is ideation, incubation and scaling. Every business idea that their employee comes up with is looked into carefully and if deemed as of potential, the next phase is incubation, where it is tried on customers and if seen as a success, it is scaled.</p>\n\n<figure><iframe src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/fzM8vIFOLkM\" title=\"YouTube video player\"></iframe></figure>\n\n<p>Not many companies take such experiments or the gamble to try an idea and that\u2019s how innovation dies or a business closes shop for good. Here are five examples of failed businesses whose stories would be reading differently today.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Nokia and Blackberry</strong></p>\n\n<p>The two were market leaders in their eras. Many have nostalgia for the iconic Nokia cellular phones that were noted for their long battery life but did not have features like the current makes of smartphones in the market.</p>\n\n<p>Nokia would still be a market leader in cellular phones had it focused on software development with the coming of the internet instead of focusing on the hardware. By focusing on the voice, the company began its gradual decline and their comeback attempt with a smartphone was not a successful one owing to the phone\u2019s operating system that had a bad user experience.</p>\n\n<p>Blackberry phones can be remembered by their keyboards that one had to key in manually but they failed to innovate by launching products with touch screens and this ate into their market share.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Blockbuster</strong></p>\n\n<p>They say that the customer is always right. Blockbuster should have listened to its clients. <a href=\"https://www.standardmedia.co.ke/ureport/article/2001332807/kenyans-share-hilarious-tales-of-their-failed-business-ventures\">As a leader in entertainment content</a>, Blockbuster, which had successfully transitioned from VHS to DVD, loved it when customers would stream in their brick and mortar stores and did not entertain the notion of shipping the customers\u2019 orders. Netflix capitalized on this and ate on the traditional Blockbuster market share.</p>\n\n<p>Had Blockbuster partnered with its competitor, it would be in business today. The problem is Blockbuster took it lightly that Netflix was only serving a niche customer base and not the mainstream ones. Then Netflix went a notch higher and began streaming services, spelling the final nail in Blockbuster\u2019s coffin.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Segway scooters</strong></p>\n\n<p>How about making a product that you don\u2019t define how or it is to be used?

The entity has been dormant with reports many projects it had planned to implement have stalled.\n\nThese counties announced they would prioritise collaborations in agriculture, trade, natural resources, sports tourism, wildlife, and their rich cultural heritage.\n\nThey would also work together to conserve the environment with mitigating against the effects of climate change being the main driving force in the collaboration.\n\nImmediately Noreb was formed, a secretariat was installed to run its affairs but the bloc has been struggling because of lack of funds.\n\nThis problem has been compounded by the fact that there is no legal provision to enable member countries to contribute money to the bloc\u2019s kitty so it can to carry out its mandate.\n\nFirst, the Public Finance Management Act does not recognise regional economic blocs and as such, it does not make provision for budgetary allocation for them.\n\nBecause of this, it had been proposed that assemblies write laws enabling counties to contribute to the kitties of the blocs. This has not been achieved partly because some assemblies are reluctant to do so.\n\nNoreb CEO Dominic Biwott said the bloc is at the mercy of well-wishers, a testament to how serious its financial problems are.\n\nOther than lack of funds, Dr Biwott also cited insecurity, the vastness of member counties and inadequate infrastructure as other challenges making it hard for Noreb to realise its dream.\n\n\u201cJust like other regional blocs, Noreb is facing serious financial challenges and this is due to lack of a legal framework to enable counties to allocate it funds,\u201d said Biwott.\n\n\u201cFailure by the regional assemblies to pass the necessary Bills on financial support to Noreb has made it difficult for us to carry out our assignment. The Public Finance Management Act does not recognise the regional economic blocs meaning they cannot draw money from member counties.\u201d\n\nHe said they are looking forward to the day the law will particularly mention economic blocs and provide for the transfer of funds from member counties to the outfits, procedures to be followed, and means of accounting for the funds.\n\n\u201cThe Controller of Budget must be able to sanction the transfer of the funds and the Auditor General enabled to audit them, otherwise, they remain institutions surviving on well-wishers,\u201d Biwott said on Monday.\n\nBiwott said there was an effort by the Ministry of Devolution to develop a national policy on the regional economic blocs but the process stalled.\n\nHe said the blocs hold the key to addressing complex issues that can neither be effectively handled by the national government nor by a single county.\n\n\u201cThat is why we need legislation that will anchor the blocs in law. It is good to note that there is a Bill by Senator Nyamunga Rose, called the County Resources Development Bill, that seems to support the formation of economic blocs. The Bill is likely to breathe fresh air in the blocs,\u201d said Biwott.\n\nDespite the struggles, he said Noreb has some achievements including making a draft to support its efforts to be anchored in the law.\n\nThe Bill will be among the things governors will discuss when they meet in Mombasa on December 16.\n\nThe Noreb secretariat has also completed an analysis on the causes of conflicts in the region and possible solutions to ensure lasting peace.\n\n\u201cWe are also developing a post-Covid-19 socio-economic recovery strategy that will be harmonised with our economic blueprint,\u201d said Biwott.\n\nIn November, Noreb launched a Transboundary Livestock Disease Control Policy aimed at building a disease-free region to ensure quality livestock and livestock products.\n\nThe policy will save the region from the annual interruption of livestock trade caused by the outbreak of diseases, said the official.\n\nMembers are currently working with the Ministry of Tourism and Wildlife to develop programmes that will boost the sector further and attract more tourists.\n\nNoreb has also developed a climate action plan for the Green Climate Fund and is expected to benefit from a Sh9.8 billion allocation from Hanns Seidel Foundation.\n\nThe bloc is also partnering with Finland\u2019s Tampere University to support Koitalel University College in developing a sports science curriculum.\n\nA meeting where Noreb, the college, and the university were to discuss the partnership, was to be held on December 10 but was postponed due to Covid-19.\n\nestablishment of the bloc was a good idea but lack of funds has hampered its operations.\n\nKipchumba said the national government should help regional economic blocs to achieve their dreams.\n\nHe added that MCAs would consider a Bill seeking to provide for how the county can contribute to Noreb\u2019s kitty.\n\n\u201cWe hope to pass the Bill soon.

Last year, Kenya exported to Uganda goods worth Sh72.2 billion, according to official data.", "articleBody": "In January this year, the government banned the importation of eggs from Uganda. The move followed a prolonged outcry by Kenyan poultry farmers who complained they were being driven out of business by their counterparts across the border.\n\nWhile slapping the ban, the government said it was out to protect local farmers from a deluge of cheap eggs from Uganda. The decision, therefore, was well-intentioned.\n\nNevertheless, it was out of tune as it went counter to the spirit of the East African Community\u2019s common market protocol.\n\nNo wonder, Ugandan farmers are up in arms. They are urging their government to retaliate and slap a ban on certain Kenyan goods.\n\nTheir demand may be justified but as Mahatma Gadhi said, an eye for an eye leaves everyone blind. That option would be as drastic as Nairobi's.\n\nUganda is our leading trading partner. Last year, Kenya exported to Uganda goods worth Sh72.2 billion, according to official data. This was an increase of 12.6 per cent from Sh64.1 billion the previous year. This made Uganda Kenya\u2019s largest export market ahead of Pakistan, the country\u2019s leading market for its tea.\n\nKenya exports to Uganda include palm oil, coated flat-rolled iron, refined petroleum, salt, pharmaceuticals, plastics lid and confectionery sugar.\n\nOn the other end, Kenya imported goods valued at Sh25.9 billion from Uganda last year, a reduction of more than a third from Sh38.5 billion in 2019. This means Nairobi enjoys a trading surplus against Kampala. Kenya has the upper hand. Besides eggs, Kenya imports raw milk, concentrated milk, raw tobacco, plywood, wood fiberboard, electricity from Uganda.\n\nWhy, then are we turning into cry-babies where we seem to enjoy clear advantage?\n\nIt is understandable when a government protects the interests of its citizens as Kenya has done. Such protection, however, must be in consonance with with the international agreements that we are party to.\n\nMoreover, protectionism is not entirely the solution. It makes farmers be inefficient, and hurts consumers who have to pay for expensive products. What the government ought to have done is to create an environment that reduces the cost of production for local producers.\n\nThe waiver of import duty on animal feeds announced by Agriculture Cabinet Secretary Peter Munya is one such good example. The move will enable farmers to access feeds at a lower cost and therefore to compete on an equal footing with their Ugandan counterparts who enjoy access to cheaper feeds.\n\nBesides expensive animal feeds, local livestock farmers also grapple with costly labour, credit, transport, electricity, and water which drive up their cost of production.\n\nAddressing problems that beset farmers, like Mr Munya has done, is good for farmers and our economy. Resorting to protectionist policies such as the one on eggs puts us on a collision course with our neighbours and raises doubts about our commitment to the EAC. Kenya might end up with egg on its face if it continues walking that path.", "articleBodyHtml": "<article>\n\n<figure><img src=\"https://cdn.standardmedia.co.ke/images/tuesday/fmfodslmvgz9b61b8c8b93dc39.jpg\"></figure>\n\n<p>In January this year, the government banned the importation of eggs from Uganda.

They are urging their government to retaliate and slap a ban on certain Kenyan goods.</p>\n\n<p>Their demand may be justified but as Mahatma Gadhi said, an eye for an eye leaves everyone blind. That option would be as drastic as Nairobi's.</p>\n\n<p>Uganda is our leading trading partner. Last year, Kenya exported to Uganda goods worth Sh72.2 billion, according to official data. This was an increase of 12.6 per cent from Sh64.1 billion the previous year. This made Uganda Kenya\u2019s largest export market ahead of Pakistan, the country\u2019s leading market for its tea.</p>\n\n<p>Kenya exports to Uganda include palm oil, coated flat-rolled iron, refined petroleum, salt, pharmaceuticals, plastics lid and confectionery sugar.</p>\n\n<p>On the other end, Kenya imported goods valued at Sh25.9 billion from Uganda last year, a reduction of more than a third from Sh38.5 billion in 2019. This means Nairobi enjoys a trading surplus against Kampala. Kenya has the upper hand. Besides eggs, Kenya imports raw milk, concentrated milk, raw tobacco, plywood, wood fiberboard, electricity from Uganda.</p>\n\n<p>Why, then are we turning into cry-babies where we seem to enjoy clear advantage?</p>\n\n<p>It is understandable when a government protects the interests of its citizens as Kenya has done. Such protection, however, must be in consonance with with the international agreements that we are party to.</p>\n\n<p>Moreover, protectionism is not entirely the solution. It makes farmers be inefficient, and hurts consumers who have to pay for expensive products. What the government ought\u00a0to have done is to create an environment that reduces the cost of production for local producers.</p>\n\n<p>The waiver of import duty on animal feeds announced by Agriculture Cabinet Secretary Peter Munya is one such good example. The move will enable farmers to access feeds at a lower cost and therefore to compete on an equal footing with their Ugandan counterparts who enjoy access to cheaper feeds.</p>\n\n<p>Besides expensive animal feeds, local livestock farmers also grapple with costly labour, credit, transport, electricity, and water which drive up their cost of production.</p>\n\n<p>Addressing problems that beset farmers, like Mr Munya has done, is good for farmers and our economy. Resorting to protectionist policies such as the one on eggs puts us on a collision course with our neighbours and raises doubts about our commitment to the EAC. Kenya might end up with egg on its face if it continues walking that path.</p>\n\n</article>", "canonicalUrl": "https://www.standardmedia.co.ke/editorial/article/2001431843/egg-ban-wont-help-boost-farmers-competitiveness"},{"url": "https://www.standardmedia.co.ke/xn-iraki/article/2001431829/why-some-rich-people-are-more-comfortable-in-eastlands", "probability": 0.9787506, "headline": "Why some rich people are more comfortable in Eastlands", "datePublished": "2021-12-15T04:00:00+03:00", "datePublishedRaw": "Wed, 15 Dec 2021 04:00:00 EAT", "dateModified": "2021-12-15T04:00:00+03:00", "dateModifiedRaw": "Wed, 15 Dec 2021 04:00:00 EAT ", "author": "XN Iraki", "authorsList": ["XN Iraki"], "inLanguage": "en", "breadcrumbs": [{"name": "Home", "link": "https://www.standardmedia.co.ke"}, {"name": "Columnists", "link": "https://www.standardmedia.co.ke/category/74/columnists"}, {"name": "Xn Iraki", "link": "https://www.standardmedia.co.ke/category/383/xn-iraki"}, {"name": "Why some rich people are more comfortable in Eastlands", "link": "https://www.standardmedia.co.ke/xn-iraki/article/2001431829/why-some-rich-people-are-more-comfortable-in-eastlands"}], "mainImage": "https://cdn.standardmedia.co.ke/images/tuesday/fujccbah3nux1rknu61b8ac2b07d4c.jpg", "images": ["https://cdn.standardmedia.co.ke/images/tuesday/fujccbah3nux1rknu61b8ac2b07d4c.jpg"], "description": "In the leafy suburbs, you have to drive to shop even for sukuma wiki.

Meslier.</p>\n\n<p>Kevin De Bruyne made it 3-0, showing pace and a clinical finish, as he latched on to a fine through ball from the impressive Rodri.</p>\n\n<p>Shortly after the restart Mahrez added the fourth, given far too much space on the corner of the box, to pick his spot and place the ball, with the aid of a heavy deflection, in the bottom corner.</p>\n\n<p>De Bruyne blasted in a spectacular, unstoppable drive from over 20 metres out, the Belgian, looking back to his very best, thundering the ball centrally.</p>\n\n<p>John Stones slotted home the sixth after a fine double save from Meslier and then substitute Nathan Ake headed in a Foden corner to make it 7-0.</p>\n\n<p>The loss was 16th-placed Leeds' joint biggest defeat since joining the Football League in 1920.</p>\n\n<p>They lost 8-1 to Stoke in 1934, 7-0 to West Ham in 1966 and 7-0 to Arsenal in 1979.</p>\n\n<p>City have 41 points with Liverpool and Chelsea, who both play on Thursday, on 37 and 36 points respectively.</p>\n\n</article>", "canonicalUrl": "https://www.standardmedia.co.ke/sports/football/2001431862/premier-league-man-city-hammer-leeds-7-0-for-seventh-straight-win"},{"url":

I am a digital content creator and social media marketer/publicist with six years of experience as a TV producer.\n\nI started my education at Salvation Army Nursery in Kisumu, went to Nyakanda Primary School and Nyaura High School in Kisii County. I have a diploma in social media strategy from Alison College and a diploma in marketing management from the Kenya Institute of Management in Nairobi.\n\nWhat was your childhood like?\n\nI spent most of my childhood in Kisumu. I remember how we used to make playing balls out of plastic bags. I would get into trouble with my parents most of the time for using my fare back home to play Playstation and trek home or for trying to open up the radio to find out what was inside.\n\nWhat are some of your fondest memories as a child?\n\nOne of my fondest memories was visiting our grandparents. The most memorable time was during Christmas holidays. My mum would take my sister and I to shop for Christmas clothes a week before the D-Day. Every day, we would try them on till Christmas Day. Every kid in the area would want to show off their Christmas swag. Christmas and New Year were a big deal.\n\nTell us about your family. How are your parents?\n\nI grew up in a Christian family. My dad is an accountant, and my mum is a businesswoman. I acquired most of my business skills from her. She used to sell mitumba clothes. I am proud of them because they have ensured we got a good life. They have always advised me on the importance of honesty.\n\nDo you have siblings and how is your relationship with them?\n\nYes, I do. We are four children, and I am the eldest. We vibe very well; they are always very supportive. When I hosted HoodLife on KTN Btv, they hated missing the show. My little brother would tell me how bad he used to feel whenever lights went off when the show was on air.\n\nWhat kind of a student were you in school?\n\nI was a performing student all through school, except for those times you can\u2019t explain how you found yourself kneeling in the principal\u2019s office. In college, I vied for Events Secretary seat and won.\n\nTalk to us about your background in media.\n\nI landed my media job in 2015 when KTN News was launched. I got a job as grip assistant, managing the studios\u2019 props and running the autocue. I won excellence awards for outstanding performance and got promoted to production assistant. Through Standard Group PLC, I got a chance to be trained on TV production by the German DW Akademie. I got promoted to an assitant TV producer and later TV/digital content producer. I have produced award-winning shows like Daktari, Str8up, Artistic Tuesday, Ecurve, Feel Good Friday, Hustle Yangu, Ladies Night, Zilizala Viwanjani, Visanga vya Makufuli, Russia World Cup 2018, and hosted Hoodlife on KTN Btv. It has been a great six years of hands-on experience.\n\nFrom your experience working with music artistes, what have you learnt?\n\nMost music artistes in Kenya don\u2019t do the art for business. Most do it for passion, and others for fame. Most of them don\u2019t get the visibility they deserve because of a lack of distribution budget and poor video quality. We need to teach our artistes about branding, too. I get pissed off when I see a big artiste using someone\u2019s brand instead of starting their own.\n\nWhat informed your decision to leave TV production to pursue digital content creation?\n\nWhen Covid-19 started last year, I was part of the team selected to be trained by the US Agency for Global Media on digital content and strategy. After the training, I got more interested in social media, and since I was handling KTN Home\u2019s social media pages, I opted to pursue a diploma in social media management. I finished and got certified.\n\nHow are you finding it so far?\n\nSocial media management is a new thing in Kenya. It keeps changing every minute and is growing fast. Some clients are embracing it while others are reluctant about it. I am learning a lot that I didn\u2019t know so that I can deliver as expected.\n\nDoes that mean you regret having done TV production?\n\nNot at all. I am grateful because one of the things that set me apart is having been in the TV production field. A combination of marketing skills and TV production makes one a great digital marketer. TV production has made me who I am today.\n\nWhat do we need to know about content creation?\n\nThere are a few things you need to understand before you start creating content. If you are producing a video, for instance, you should research the genre you want to curate. Know and understand your target audience. You need to carefully analyse the resources required like personnel and equipment to execute the project. The creator should know which channels they want to broadcast on. One thing you need to keep in mind is that content doesn\u2019t pay overnight. You require 1,000 subscribers and 4,000 watched hours within 365 days to start monetising a YouTube channel. One of the other ways to monetise your content is through product placement, where someone may want to advertise their product on the video.\n\nWhat are some of the challenges you are facing?\n\nOne challenge is getting gigs that pay well. The high cost of the Internet in the country is another challenge for digital marketers. High tax on equipment is another challenge for content creators, not to mention low subscriptions to events.\n\nWhat would you change if you had a chance?\n\nGiven a chance, I would change how the youth use the Internet. The Internet is full of useful information that can create job opportunities that would definitely reduce unemployment.", "articleBodyHtml": "<article>\n\n<figure><img src=\"https://cdn.standardmedia.co.ke/images/tuesday/most_kenyan_artistes61b8721d1fb9d.jpg\"></figure>\n\n<p>INNOCENT MACHUMA MATARA, a former TV producer, talks\u00a0about his new-found passion for digital content creation and marketing, and what he thinks is ailing many Kenyan musicians.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Who is Innocent Machuma Matara?</strong></p>\n\n<p>I am 31 years old and was born in Kisumu County.

My brother, David, and I, therefore, relied on Simba, our female pet dog, to give us puppies that we would train to hunt so we would have a competitive advantage over fellow village boys.\n\nSimba also offered security to our mother as she went looking for firewood in the vast forest.\n\nBut we had a problem; Simba would carry a pregnancy to term and give birth without complications to a litter of around eight puppies every season but only two would survive.\n\nThe affected puppies, which were usually less than eight weeks old, would be weak, start vomiting and have bloody diarrhoea.\n\nWe would bottle-feed them with cow milk in a frantic effort to rescue them but they would die one after the other. We never knew what killed the puppies.\n\nI came to learn later, during my clinical years at the University of Nairobi, that our puppies used to succumb to a disease called canine parvovirus, or simply \u2018parvo\u2019.\n\nWhat causes parvo?\n\nParvo is caused by the canine parvovirus. This virus is highly contagious and spreads through direct contact with an infected dog or by indirect contact with a contaminated object.\n\nYour puppy is exposed every time they sniff, lick, or consume infected faeces. Indirect transmission occurs when a person who has recently been exposed to an infected dog touches your puppy, or when a puppy encounters a contaminated object, like a food or water bowl, collars and leashes, and the hands and clothing of people who handle infected dogs.\n\nThe virus prefers to infect the small intestine, where it destroys cells, impairs absorption, and disrupts the gut barrier. Parvo in puppies also affects the bone marrow.\n\nWhy do puppies get parvo?\n\nPuppies ages six weeks to six months are the most susceptible to parvo.\n\nPuppies younger than six weeks old still retain some of their mother\u2019s antibodies, assuming that their mother received her full series of parvo vaccinations.\n\nThey are vulnerable to the disease until they have received all three shots in their vaccination series, which means owners need to take extra precautions during this time to prevent their puppies from contracting the virus.\n\nThe severity of parvo cases varies. The stress of weaning can lead to a more severe case of parvo in puppies, as stress weakens the immune system.\n\nA combination of parvo and a secondary infection or a parasite can also lead to a more severe case of parvo in puppies.\n\nCertain breeds of dogs are at an increased risk of parvo: German Shepherds, Rottweilers, Doberman Pinschers, Labrador Retrievers, and English Springer Spaniels.\n\nPuppies and adult dogs with parvo start shedding the virus within four to five days of exposure.\n\nHowever, this time period does not always coincide with the first parvo symptoms, which means dogs can be contagious before owners even realise that they are sick.\n\nPuppies with parvo continue to shed the virus for up to 10 days after clinical recovery.\n\nTherefore, keep any puppies recovering from parvo away from unvaccinated and partially vaccinated dogs.\n\nWhat are the symptoms?\n\nCall your vet any time you notice signs like severe bloody diarrhoea, vomiting, fever, lethargy, inappetence, weight loss, weakness, dehydration, red and inflamed tissue around the eyes and mouth. Other signs are rapid heartbeat, pain or discomfort, low body temperature, and depression.", "articleBodyHtml": "<article>\n\n<figure><img alt=\"\" src=\"https://cdn.standardmedia.co.ke/images/monday/sfsnmxmjkhohgnmb61b705ca2dcec.jpg\"></figure>\n\n<p>Growing up on the slopes of Aberdare Ranges in Nyandarua County, owning a hunting dog was a must.</p>\n\n<p>Dog owners took home hind or front legs of the hares we used to hunt.

In fact, fibroids are considered the most common type of tumour that occurs in women of reproductive age.\n\nDuring an interview, Dr Alfred Mukomba highlights that fibroids are more common in the African race. According to doctors at the Aga Khan University Hospital in Nairobi, one in every five women, especially in their reproductive years, has fibroids. By the age of 50, 80 per cent of women are likely to have developed fibroids.\n\nFibroids \u2014 medically known as myomas or leiomyomas \u2014 are usually benign smooth muscle cell tumours that can occur at any part of the uterus.\n\nTheir growth is possibly motivated by delayed motherhood and extended intake of hormonal contraceptives. \u201cTo those who get pregnant early, fibroids tend not to grow as much.\n\nBut during pregnancy, because of the high hormone levels, the fibroids can grow to a very large size from a very small size within that very short time,\u201d says Dr Mukomba.\n\nIt is typical of fibroids to stop growing by the time a woman reaches menopause. Fibroids are not life-threatening, but they have the potential to profoundly impact a woman\u2019s quality of life. They may not interfere with ovulation, but they may affect a woman\u2019s ability to carry a pregnancy to term.\n\nFibroids can be;\n\nSubmucosal - growing directly under the uterine lining\n\nIntramural - embedded within the wall of the uterus\n\nSubserosal - bulging outward from the uterine ling\n\nPendunculated - hanging from a stem within or outside the uterus. They cause serious pain when they twist about their stems.\n\nComplications\n\nPain\n\nSince fibroids are largely asymptomatic, most women cannot even tell whether they have them or not. However, some women may experience a high degree of pain and discomfort during menses or sexual intercourse.\n\nPendunculated fibroids pain is so intense that it interferes with one\u2019s ability to perform normally especially during monthly periods. Some women complain of increased bleeding, lower back pain, discomfort when bending and painful defecation.\n\nBig belly\n\nFibroids vary in size. They may grow as lone tumours or cluster in groups inside or outside the uterus. Women with several large fibroids are often mistaken to be about 20 weeks with child.\n\nFibroids can make the belly feel big and bloated, akin to what one feels when they have had too much to eat. It could be frustrating when you seem to do all you can to lose an enlarged tummy with no success. Your fibroids could be to blame.\n\nFrequent urination\n\nSince the uterus is located right above the bladder, the weight of fibroids can increase the pressure on the bladder, forcing you to head to the bathroom every now and then.\n\nFibroids can also cause urine retention as they prevent full emptying of the bladder. Urine retention has been sighted as a major source of breeding bacteria that eventually cause urinary tract infectionn (UTI).\n\nRisky pregnancy\n\nThe presence of fibroids may not always cause problems during pregnancy. However, they can cause mechanical distortion of the uterus wall and alter embryo implantation.\n\nIn pregnancy, large fibroids can potentially move the growing foetus to a position that makes natural delivery difficult or even dangerous.\n\nDepending on their size and location, fibroids have also been documented to stress the uterus causing preterm birth, premature rupture of membranes or miscarriage.\n\nA study published in PubMed links fibroids located in the lower uterine segment to placenta retention after vaginal delivery. Retained placenta is considered as one of the major causes of postpartum haemorrhage, which is a major cause of maternal deaths.\n\nAbnormal bleeding\n\nDoctors at the Kenya Laparoscopic Surgery Services warn that fibroids interfere with blood flow in the uterine wall lining. This can cause prolonged and painful periods. Women who bleed excessively end up developing anaemia.\n\nTreatment for fibroids is available. The type of treatment depends on the location, size and manifesting symptoms associated with them. Options for treatment according to the Aga Khan University Hospital include:\n\n\u00b7 Uterine Fibroid Embolisation \u2013 a painless, non-surgical procedure that involves the insertion of a thin catheter through a 2mm \u2018cut\u2019. The catheter releases a substance that blocks the blood supply to the fibroids. The fibroids soften and shrink in size due to the deprivation of blood and nutrients. Patients are safe to conceive after the operation, but are advised to wait for six months before trying.\n\n\u00b7 Open myomectomy \u2013 open surgery to remove fibroids. It is done when the patient aims to preserve her ability to bear children.\n\n\u00b7 Abdominal hysterectomy - recommended for women who have large fibroids and have completed their families. It involves the removal of the uterus through a lower abdomen incision. Vaginal hysterectomy can also be recommended for medium-sized fibroids.\n\n\u00b7 Laparoscopic myomectomy - a less invasive procedure compared to open myomectomy. The surgeon may remove the fibroids robotically through incisions of 0.5cm to 1.5cm on the abdomen. A laparoscopic hysterectomy removes the entire uterus through such incisions.", "articleBodyHtml": "<article>\n\n<p>A majority of women will get one or more fibroids at some point in their lifetime.

By the age of 50, 80 per cent of women are likely to have developed fibroids.</p>\n\n<p>Fibroids \u2014 medically known as myomas or leiomyomas \u2014 are usually benign smooth muscle cell tumours that can occur at any part of the uterus.</p>\n\n<p>Their growth is possibly motivated by delayed motherhood and extended intake of hormonal contraceptives. \u201cTo those who get pregnant early, fibroids tend not to grow as much.</p>\n\n<p>But during pregnancy, because of the high hormone levels, the fibroids can grow to a very large size from a very small size within that very short time,\u201d says Dr Mukomba.</p>\n\n<p>It is typical of fibroids to stop growing by the time a woman reaches menopause. Fibroids are not life-threatening, but they have the potential to profoundly impact a woman\u2019s quality of life. They may not interfere with ovulation, but they may affect a woman\u2019s ability to carry a pregnancy to term.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Fibroids can be;</strong></p>\n\n<p>Submucosal - growing directly under the uterine lining</p>\n\n<p>Intramural - embedded within the wall of the uterus</p>\n\n<p>Subserosal - bulging outward from the uterine ling</p>\n\n<p>Pendunculated - hanging from a stem within or outside the uterus. They cause serious pain when they twist about their stems.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Complications</strong></p>\n\n<p><strong>Pain</strong></p>\n\n<p>Since fibroids are largely asymptomatic, most women cannot even tell whether they have them or not. However, some women may experience a high degree of pain and discomfort during menses or sexual intercourse.</p>\n\n<p>Pendunculated fibroids pain is so intense that it interferes with one\u2019s ability to perform normally especially during monthly periods. Some women complain of increased bleeding, lower back pain, discomfort when bending and painful defecation.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Big belly</strong></p>\n\n<p>Fibroids vary in size. They may grow as lone tumours or cluster in groups inside or outside the uterus. Women with several large fibroids are often mistaken to be about 20 weeks with child.</p>\n\n<p>Fibroids can make the belly feel big and bloated, akin to what one feels when they have had too much to eat. It could be frustrating when you seem to do all you can to lose an enlarged tummy with no success. Your fibroids could be to blame.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Frequent urination</strong></p>\n\n<p>Since the uterus is located right above the bladder, the weight of fibroids can increase the pressure on the bladder, forcing you to head to the bathroom every now and then.</p>\n\n<p>Fibroids can also cause urine retention as they prevent full emptying of the bladder. Urine retention has been sighted as a major source of breeding bacteria that eventually cause urinary tract infectionn (UTI).</p>\n\n<p><strong>Risky pregnancy</strong></p>\n\n<p>The presence of fibroids may not always cause problems during pregnancy. However, they can cause mechanical distortion of the uterus wall and alter embryo implantation.</p>\n\n<p>In pregnancy, large fibroids can potentially move the growing foetus to a position that makes natural delivery difficult or even dangerous.</p>\n\n<p>Depending on their size and location, fibroids have also been documented to stress the uterus causing preterm birth, premature rupture of membranes or miscarriage.</p>\n\n<p>A study published in PubMed links fibroids located in the lower uterine segment to placenta retention after vaginal delivery. Retained placenta is considered as one of the major causes of postpartum haemorrhage, which is a major cause of maternal deaths.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Abnormal bleeding</strong></p>\n\n<p>Doctors at the Kenya Laparoscopic Surgery Services warn that fibroids interfere with blood flow in the uterine wall lining. This can cause prolonged and painful periods. Women who bleed excessively end up developing anaemia.</p>\n\n<p>Treatment for fibroids is available. The type of treatment depends on the location, size and manifesting symptoms associated with them. Options for treatment according to the Aga Khan University Hospital include:</p>\n\n<p>\u00b7\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Uterine Fibroid Embolisation \u2013 a painless, non-surgical procedure that involves the insertion of a thin catheter through a 2mm \u2018cut\u2019. The catheter releases a substance that blocks the blood supply to the fibroids. The fibroids soften and shrink in size due to the deprivation of blood and nutrients. Patients are safe to conceive after the operation, but are advised to wait for six months before trying.</p>\n\n<p>\u00b7\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Open myomectomy \u2013 open surgery to remove fibroids. It is done when the patient aims to preserve her ability to bear children.</p>\n\n<p>\u00b7\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Abdominal hysterectomy - recommended for women who have large fibroids and have completed their families. It involves the removal of the uterus through a lower abdomen incision. Vaginal hysterectomy can also be recommended for medium-sized fibroids.</p>\n\n<p>\u00b7\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Laparoscopic myomectomy - a less invasive procedure compared to open myomectomy. The surgeon may remove the fibroids robotically through incisions of 0.5cm to 1.5cm on the abdomen. A laparoscopic hysterectomy removes the entire uterus through such incisions.</p>\n\n</article>", "canonicalUrl": "https://www.standardmedia.co.ke/evewoman/health/article/2001431875/why-you-must-not-ignore-fibroids"},{"url": "https://www.standardmedia.co.ke/farmkenya/article/2001431716/maize-farmers-grapple-with-high-costs-dwindling-returns", "probability": 0.98811483, "headline": "Maize farmers grapple with high costs, dwindling returns", "datePublished": "2021-12-13T10:26:27+03:00", "datePublishedRaw": "Mon, 13 Dec 2021 10:26:27 EAT", "dateModified": "2021-12-13T10:40:52+03:00", "dateModifiedRaw": "Mon, 13 Dec 2021 10:40:52 EAT", "author": "Titus Too | 2 days ago", "authorsList": ["Titus Too | 2 days ago"], "inLanguage": "en", "breadcrumbs": [{"name": "Home", "link": "https://www.standardmedia.co.ke/farmkenya"}, {"name": "Crop", "link": "https://www.standardmedia.co.ke/farmkenya/news/438/Crop"}, {"name": "Maize farmers grapple with high costs, dwindling returns", "link": "https://www.standardmedia.co.ke/farmkenya/article/2001431716/maize-farmers-grapple-with-high-costs-dwindling-returns"}], "mainImage": "https://cdn.standardmedia.co.ke/images/monday/kngvih7bcrgzwf9t61b6f6ceca2cc.jpg", "images": ["https://cdn.standardmedia.co.ke/images/monday/kngvih7bcrgzwf9t61b6f6ceca2cc.jpg"], "description": "ering added that an acre in asin ishu produces an average of 22 to 25 bags of maize", "articleBody": "High production costs, changing climate patterns, pests, diseases and poor marketing have derailed the production of maize.\n\nThough farmers in maize-producing regions have mastered weather patterns to strike a balance every maize season, achieving optimal production and good returns to the agribusiness venture have proven unattainable.\n\nCornelius Kering, a farmer who leased a farm for maize production in Soy, said they cannot make it even as the cost of inputs skyrocket while maize prices drop.\n\n\u201cFrom the seven acres I leased in Soy, I expect to harvest an average of 150 bags of maize, each 90kg.

Topics women have in the past not been allowed to utter openly lest they are branded \u201cbad\u201d.\n\nA platform where women can openly talk about everything from regretting motherhood, to adoption, to sharing their struggles with conception, to the choice to be childless. Talk about mothering from prison, mothering and mental health, motherhood and divorce, to sharing about toxic motherhood.\n\nWhat was Ami\u2019s inspiration? \u201cThere was a story last year about a lady who gave outside Pumwani hospital. I was so affected by this story and planned to do a documentary on the law and policy around healthcare around maternity.\n\nThen Covid-19 happened and everything stopped, but I had already done some research and discovered so many different stories, things that women had gone through or were going through, that no one was openly talking about.\n\nI knew I had to create a safe space for women to openly talk about in order to dismantle the stereotypes society has built around womanhood and maternity. To create a safe space for women to share the stories of their journey through mothering differently.\u201d\n\nSome of these so-called taboo topics include stories like that of Jeri Muchura, 38. She is a mother of three and an award-winning photographer who passionately believes that mothers and women should be allowed to be multifaceted.\n\n\u201cWhen it comes to motherhood, women are often put on pedestals as if they come pre-installed with a chip or software called motherhood. Society seemingly believes that just because a woman has given birth, she automatically feels complete and experiences never-ending happiness. The worst thing she can do is mention any other emotions like being upset, unprepared, regret or even overwhelmed,\u201d says Jeri.\n\n\u201cI, for example, took all precautions not to get pregnant. However, my doctor did not ask whether I was on birth control when he prescribed me certain antibiotics. Both medicines counteracted and neutralised each other and I got pregnant at 26. Society declares that when you get pregnant, you have no right to be upset, especially when it is unexpected. Although men are allowed to be upset when they get a lady pregnant, the same grace is not extended to women.\u201d\n\nJeri believes that women should be allowed to be open about the length and breadth of motherhood.\n\n\u201cMothers, for example, should be allowed to acknowledge that while you may love your child or children, they may have come too early and interrupted your education or career trajectory. When it comes to motherhood, women are only allowed to feel two emotions; pride and happiness. Feeling other emotions like regret over the loss of a career means something is wrong with you, yet it just shows that women are human and not these \u2018long-suffering demigods\u2019 society imagines them to be.\u201d\n\nJeri adds that this need to suppress women\u2019s emotions is what prevents women from speaking up when they have postpartum depression.\n\n\u201cEven women, who have more than one child, often have different emotions with each birth. With the first, it could be butterflies and happiness, but with the second it could be a struggle to even bond. This is why some mothers suffer silently or keep their feelings hidden if they are not in line with societies standards,\u201d she says.\n\n\u201cWhen I became a mother, my career suffered. I had to take a back seat as I watched the careers of others progress and to be honest, mothering set me back almost seven years. At the time I was on radio, doing TV production work, and was on my way to becoming a TV presenter, but after taking a break I could not catch up.\u201d\n\nJeri states that she had to sit down with herself and acknowledge how she felt, and allow herself to heal.\n\n\u201cAcknowledging the feeling of regretting the timing of motherhood allowed me to heal, love my children more, and even get into a new career. It does not mean that something is wrong with you, but that you are just human. If necessary, go to therapy. Allow yourself to acknowledge the emotion so that you can let it go, or you can end up hurting the people you love the most,\u201d she adds.\n\nJeri\u2019s journey\n\n\u201cMy healing journey led me to take up photography and this is what literally saved my life. I have photographed for top companies in the country, travelled all over the continent and even bagged a couple of international photography awards for my work. Now I work with an amazing organisation called Photo Start Foundation as their Country Programme Coordinator and Lead Educator training up the next generation of photographers and storytellers.\u201d\n\nThen there are other stories like that of Christine Muthoni, which delves into one of these so-called taboo topics: the divorcee mother. Christine, 39, a family law lawyer says that when it comes to women, society has these preconceived ideas or standards of who a \u2018good\u2019 woman should look like.\n\n\u201cA lot of times these standards end up imprisoning women in situations they have no business being in because they believe that they do not have other choices. Yet there are a variety of choices, and though different are okay. I am a mother of two and in the process of divorce.\u201d\n\nChristine got married in 2011 because it was the next expected natural step for her to take as an upstanding and respectable member of society.\n\n\u201cI knew that at a certain age I was required to be married and to start a family, and because I had a religious background, I had no business co-habiting. I got married and expected the happy ever after I had been conditioned to expect. I was not really prepared for what it meant to be a wife or mother. All I knew was that I was expected to have a big wedding that would impress society and earn me the title \u2018Mrs,\u2019\u201d she says.\n\nChristine says that a few months into her marriage she quickly realised that it was not what she expected. \u201cAt this stage, the butterflies and excitement are over, and you begin to see your partner and yourself for who you truly both are, and quickly realise that maybe you are not compatible. Maybe you are not designed to be a wife or homemaker. Maybe there is more to life.\u201d\n\nFurther, she adds that society does not offer much help when a marriage is in trouble.\n\n\u201cIf you seek redress in church you are told to fast and pray for your marriage. Persevere because it rains everywhere, attend church more and join marriage enrichment groups,\u201d says Christine.\n\n\u201cI believe that marriage should be enjoyable, fulfilling, wholesome and a peaceful experience. After all, that is going to be your experience for the rest of your life. If at any one point it ceases being that, then one should be at liberty to make a different choice for themselves and know that it is okay.\u201d\n\nTen years gone and two children later, it become evident to Christine that she and her ex were done. \u201cI accepted that it was okay to change my mind and to take a different path. I did not have to be a prisoner of a decision I made in my youth.\n\nI was unhappy and miserable and it was not good for both of us or our children. Our divorce is not finalised yet, but I am grateful that it has not been acrimonious thus far. I am hopeful that my ex-husband and I will be able to maintain a cordial relationship in future. I have nothing against marriage, I do not believe it is for everyone. People should know they have a choice.\u201d\n\nUnhappy together\n\nChristine is currently writing a book about Conscious Uncoupling. The book seeks to change the narrative around uncoupling and the antagonistic nature of divorce. In it, she shares her own experience and seeks to offer a foothold on the legal process of divorce as well as a guide on healing and finding yourself again through the process.\n\nAnother example is Mwenda Mbaabu, 39, mother of a 16-year-old girl, and a published author, spiritual teacher and transformational coach, whose choice is not to get married.\n\n\u201cThe idea of marriage where both parties promise each other forever does not make sense to me. I mean, no one commits to work in a job forever or be friends with someone forever. Yet somehow with romantic relationships there this obsession with forever even when you no longer like the person, or want to be married,\u201d says Mwenda.\n\nMwenda says that this obsession with forever is what results in people having mistresses rather than just ending these relationships.\n\n\u201cRomantic relationships are partnerships and not ownership. It is a decision by two adults to come together to partner in life and offer companionship, love, and intimate support to one another. I have never felt the need to hurry to get into relationships as there is a time for everything,\u201d she says.\n\n\u201cI do want to be in a long-term relationship with someone who shares similar values. I desire to be with someone who sees me as a partner and human being, and not just a woman. I am a human being with dreams, plans, desires, and ideas. I cannot be with someone who sees the world from a conservative, black and white traditional mindset or who wants a \u2018wife material\u2019 and is obsessed with gender roles,\u201d she adds.\n\nSo, what does the coach teach her daughter about marriage: \u201cTo live her life as authentically as possible, following her heart. She wants to get married and have children. Nothing wrong with that. Everyone should be true to themselves.\u201d", "articleBodyHtml": "<article>\n\n<p>In 2020 Ami Jasho, 38, a mother, wife, gender activist, feminist and storyteller with 15 years of experience in strategic communications and sustainable development, founded the digital platform \u201cUnmothering the Woman.\u201d</p>\n\n<p>Imagine a platform where women can speak openly about topics that have always been taboo topics that revolve around \u201cmotherhood\u201d or \u201cwomanhood\u201d.

Christine, 39, a family law lawyer says that when it comes to women, society has these preconceived ideas or standards of who a \u2018good\u2019 woman should look like.</p>\n\n<p>\u201cA lot of times these standards end up imprisoning women in situations they have no business being in because they believe that they do not have other choices. Yet there are a variety of choices, and though different are okay. I am a mother of two and in the process of divorce.\u201d</p>\n\n<p>Christine got married in 2011 because it was the next expected natural step for her to take as an upstanding and respectable member of society.</p>\n\n<p>\u201cI knew that at a certain age I was required to be married and to start a family, and because I had a religious background, I had no business co-habiting. I got married and expected the happy ever after I had been conditioned to expect. I was not really prepared for what it meant to be a wife or mother. All I knew was that I was expected to have a big wedding that would impress society and earn me the title \u2018Mrs,\u2019\u201d she says.</p>\n\n<p>Christine says that a few months into her marriage she quickly realised that it was not what she expected. \u201cAt this stage, the butterflies and excitement are over, and you begin to see your partner and yourself for who you truly both are, and quickly realise that maybe you are not compatible. Maybe you are not designed to be a wife or homemaker. Maybe there is more to life.\u201d</p>\n\n<p>Further, she adds that society does not offer much help when a marriage is in trouble.</p>\n\n<p>\u201cIf you seek redress in church you are told to fast and pray for your marriage. Persevere because it rains everywhere, attend church more and join marriage enrichment groups,\u201d says Christine.</p>\n\n<p>\u201cI believe that marriage should be enjoyable, fulfilling, wholesome and a peaceful experience. After all, that is going to be your experience for the rest of your life. If at any one point it ceases being that, then one should be at liberty to make a different choice for themselves and know that it is okay.\u201d</p>\n\n<p>Ten years gone and two children later, it become evident to Christine that she and her ex were done. \u201cI accepted that it was okay to change my mind and to take a different path. I did not have to be a prisoner of a decision I made in my youth.</p>\n\n<p>I was unhappy and miserable and it was not good for both of us or our children. Our divorce is not finalised yet, but I am grateful that it has not been acrimonious thus far. I am hopeful that my ex-husband and I will be able to maintain a cordial relationship in future. I have nothing against marriage, I do not believe it is for everyone. People should know they have a choice.\u201d</p>\n\n<p><strong>Unhappy together</strong></p>\n\n<p>Christine is currently writing a book about Conscious Uncoupling. The book seeks to change the narrative around uncoupling and the antagonistic nature of divorce. In it, she shares her own experience and seeks to offer a foothold on the legal process of divorce as well as a guide on healing and finding yourself again through the process.</p>\n\n<p>Another example is Mwenda Mbaabu, 39, mother of a 16-year-old girl, and a published author, spiritual teacher and transformational coach, whose choice is not to get married.</p>\n\n<p>\u201cThe idea of marriage where both parties promise each other forever does not make sense to me. I mean, no one commits to work in a job forever or be friends with someone forever. Yet somehow with romantic relationships there this obsession with forever even when you no longer like the person, or want to be married,\u201d says Mwenda.</p>\n\n<p>Mwenda says that this obsession with forever is what results in people having mistresses rather than just ending these relationships.</p>\n\n<p>\u201cRomantic relationships are partnerships and not ownership. It is a decision by two adults to come together to partner in life and offer companionship, love, and intimate support to one another. I have never felt the need to hurry to get into relationships as there is a time for everything,\u201d she says.</p>\n\n<p>\u201cI do want to be in a long-term relationship with someone who shares similar values. I desire to be with someone who sees me as a partner and human being, and not just a woman. I am a human being with dreams, plans, desires, and ideas. I cannot be with someone who sees the world from a conservative, black and white traditional mindset or who wants a \u2018wife material\u2019 and is obsessed with gender roles,\u201d she adds.</p>\n\n<p>So, what does the coach teach her daughter about marriage: \u201cTo live her life as authentically as possible, following her heart. She wants to get married and have children. Nothing wrong with that. Everyone should be true to themselves.\u201d</p>\n\n</article>", "canonicalUrl": "https://www.standardmedia.co.ke/evewoman/young-women/article/2001431873/learning-the-difference-between-womanhood-and-motherhood"},{"url": "https://www.standardmedia.co.ke/farmkenya/article/2001431715/soil-tips-to-beat-climate-change", "probability": 0.9653688, "headline": "Soil tips to beat climate change", "datePublished": "2021-12-13T09:09:12+03:00", "datePublishedRaw": "Mon, 13 Dec 2021 09:09:12 EAT", "dateModified": "2021-12-14T15:53:23+03:00", "dateModifiedRaw": "Tue, 14 Dec 2021 15:53:23 EAT", "author": "George Mbakaya | 2 days ago", "authorsList": ["George Mbakaya | 2 days ago"], "inLanguage": "en", "breadcrumbs": [{"name": "Home", "link": "https://www.standardmedia.co.ke/farmkenya"}, {"name": "News", "link": "https://www.standardmedia.co.ke/farmkenya"}, {"name": "Soil tips to beat climate change", "link": "https://www.standardmedia.co.ke/farmkenya/article/2001431715/soil-tips-to-beat-climate-change"}], "mainImage": "https://cdn.standardmedia.co.ke/images/monday/soil_tips_to_beat_cl61b6e45631a5e.jpg", "images": ["https://cdn.standardmedia.co.ke/images/monday/soil_tips_to_beat_cl61b6e45631a5e.jpg"], "description": "hese damaging substances filtrate the topsoil and harm life within it unbalancing the delicate system", "articleBodyHtml": "<article>\n\n<figure><strong>\n<img src=\"https://cdn.standardmedia.co.ke/images/monday/soil_tips_to_beat_cl61b6e45631a5e.jpg\">\n</strong>\n<figcaption>\n<strong>These damaging substances filtrate the topsoil and harm life within it, unbalancing the delicate system.\n</strong>\n</figcaption></figure>\n\n</article>", "canonicalUrl": "https://www.standardmedia.co.ke/farmkenya/article/2001431715/soil-tips-to-beat-climate-change"},{"url": "https://www.standardmedia.co.ke/terms-and-conditions", "probability": 0.5403749, "headline": "Terms and Conditions", "datePublishedRaw": "1.

Kenya\u2019s Vision 2030, one of Kibaki\u2019s legacies, continues to define our course as a nation,\u201d President Kenyatta wrote.\n\nKenya Year Book Chief Executive Officer Edward Mwasi says the book will give Kenyans a sneak peek into the lives and the minds of those who helped President Kibaki actualize the vision he had for the country.\n\n\u201cThis is not just for history but it will show us that different governments have different priorities and this book will show Kenyans what the priorities of former President Kibaki were,\u201d Mwasi says.\n\nFor Mwasi, the cabinet profiles, including the previous collection on former President Moi\u2019s cabinets provide an opportunity for sitting heads of state to learn from the success and failures of their predecessors to do better.\n\nIn the foreword, President Uhuru Kenyatta also said that the Kenya Yearbook Editorial Board\u2019s Cabinet series represents a compendium of history makers. A story of Kenya\u2019s giants!

Kenya\u2019s Vision 2030, one of Kibaki\u2019s legacies, continues to define our course as a nation,\u201d President Kenyatta wrote.</p>\n\n<p>Kenya Year Book Chief Executive Officer Edward Mwasi says the book will give Kenyans a sneak peek into the lives and the minds of those who helped President Kibaki actualize the vision he had for the country.</p>\n\n<p>\u201cThis is not just for history but it will show us that different governments have different priorities and this book will show Kenyans what the priorities of former President Kibaki were,\u201d Mwasi says.</p>\n\n<p>For Mwasi, the cabinet profiles, including the previous collection on former President Moi\u2019s cabinets provide an opportunity for sitting heads of state to learn from the success and failures of their predecessors to do better.</p>\n\n<p>In the foreword, President Uhuru Kenyatta also said that the Kenya Yearbook Editorial Board\u2019s Cabinet series represents a compendium of history makers.

We look at his political journey in our third serialisation of Kibaki Cabinets, a publication by the Kenya Year Book Editorial Board\n\nRaphael Tuju was appointed Minister for Information and Tourism in the first Cabinet of former President Mwai Kibaki in 2003. His assistant at the ministry was Beth Mugo.\n\nTuju, a renowned journalist, was no doubt a good fit for the role. An alumnus of the University of Leicester, United Kingdom, Tuju had in the late 1980s and early 1990s worked as a part-time television news anchor. Besides, he had produced and directed several documentaries, television and radio commercials for international agencies, private sector bodies and public institutions. And he had been a columnist for local newspapers, particularly the East African Standard.\n\nTuju\u2019s professional background gave him first-hand experience of how critical media freedom was in a democratic and progressive society. It, therefore, did not come as a surprise that while he was at the helm of the Ministry of Information and Tourism, the Kibaki administration nurtured greater freedom of expression. State House kept its hands off media content and tolerated criticism. Further, the voice of the civil society got louder than it had been before.\n\nIn a bid to have Kenya retain her position as the regional centre for international news, Tuju made liberalisation of the airwaves a priority of his ministry. Under the Kanu regime, privately-owned radio stations were only allowed to broadcast in limited spaces, but the State-owned Kenya Broadcasting Corporation (KBC) enjoyed unlimited airwaves access.\n\nEven though the Kanu government had partially liberalised the airwaves in 1996, rapid expansion of the broadcasting sector started in 2003. In line with the Narc vision, Tuju oversaw the allocation of numerous frequencies to private investors. This resulted in the birth of more than 50 privately-owned radio stations in Kibaki\u2019s first term.\n\nIt was during Tuju\u2019s time at the Ministry of Information and Tourism that vernacular radio stations began popping up in large numbers. Privately-owned vernacular radio stations such as Kameme FM, which broadcasts in G?k?y?, Kass FM, which broadcasts in Kalenjin, and Ramogi FM, which broadcasts in Dholuo, among others came into existence.\n\nUnder Tuju\u2019s leadership, the television sector also grew. New players such Sayare TV (2004) and K24 (2007) arrived on the scene. In addition to other privately-owned television stations such as the Kenya Television Network (KTN), started in 1990, and Nation TV (NTV), started in 1999, the new players in the television sector offered Kenyans a range of sources of information in Kiswahili, Kenya\u2019s lingua franca, English and other indigenous languages to choose from.\n\nPrint media, too, did well thanks to the media freedom occasioned by the change of guard. The two leading dailies, the Daily Nation and the East African Standard maintained their dominance of the Kenyan market. But by the end of the first term of the Kibaki Presidency, the number of newspapers in the country had shot up to eight. Nation Media Group launched the Business Daily whose beat was finance and economic affairs. Patrick Quarcoo\u2019s The Star newspaper also came into existence around the same time.\n\nAware of what potent tools media outlets are in the construction of a people\u2019s popular culture, Tuju insisted that the local media creates room for local content. On August 8, 2003, Tuju announced that from January 1, 2004, local television stations would be required to broadcast a minimum of 20 per cent local content. For radio stations, he set the ratio at 30 per cent. Tuju\u2019s directive was not successfully executed then. It, however, brought the subject of suitability of media content to the national discourse table.\n\nAs the Minister for Information and Tourism, Tuju took Kenya\u2019s image redemption campaign to the global arena. Fed up of what in media parlance is called bad press, Tuju attempted to take Kenya\u2019s broadcasting voice to the United Kingdom. His intention was to reverse the 50-year one-way broadcasting regime that Kenya and Britain had maintained. In November 2003, Tuju and Wachira Waruru, then the head of the KBC, visited London to apply for an FM radio station licence to enable KBC to be heard in the UK.\n\nThe FM station, in Tuju\u2019s view, would offer an alternative voice to that of the British Broadcasting Corporation (BBC). Tuju argued that unlike the BBC, the Kenya-owned FM radio station would give Kenya unbiased media coverage. The bid failed. It turned out that British broadcasting laws only allowed European companies to run radio stations in Britain. Besides, at the time all the licences for the London FM spectrum were booked up to 2010. Even though the law has since changed and non-nationals can now apply for licences and run FM stations in the UK, the challenge of limited FM spectrum persists.\n\nTuju\u2019s fight against the bad press Kenya was getting in the wake of Al Qaeda terrorist attacks was boosted by the fact that it enjoyed the support of Kenyans. As a result, Kenya\u2019s tourism industry, the third largest foreign exchange earner in the country, had lost $125 million (Sh13.5 billion) since the 1998 US Embassy bomb attack in Nairobi. Immediately after the attack, European and American authorities released travel advisories to their citizenry citing Kenya as an unsafe destination. The situation had been aggravated by the ban of UK flights to Nairobi and Mombasa by the British government in May 2003. The ban was anchored on the fear of terrorist attacks on western targets.\n\nAfter his bid to establish an FM station in the UK flopped, Tuju changed tack. He made a series of appearances on international radio and television stations. Tuju gave one message at each of the talk shows. He informed the world that even though Nairobi was concerned about the terrorism threat, it had taken all the necessary precautions. He emphasised that Kenya was not any more vulnerable to terrorist attacks than other tourist destinations.\n\nTuju\u2019s crusade paid off. The UK lifted the Nairobi and Mombasa flight ban.\n\nHe served Kibaki\u2019s administration as the Information and Tourism Minister until 2005. His later stint in the Cabinet had much to do with the convulsions that engulfed Narc in the lead up to the 2005 referendum.\n\nWithin months of clinching power, cracks emerged in the coalition. These cracks assumed the form of a Kibaki-Raila Odinga power-sharing tussle. Odinga claimed that his party and Kibaki\u2019s had signed a pre-election Memorandum of Understanding (MoU) that spelt out how they would share power after winning elections. The MoU supposedly stipulated a 50-50 power sharing formula between Kibaki\u2019s and Odinga\u2019s parties.\n\nSwitched allegiance\n\nKibaki never disowned the existence of the MoU. His position, however, was that the MoU was limited to Cabinet slots. He disagreed with Odinga\u2019s demand that the MoU extended to the civil service. Odinga and his supporters wanted the MoU to overlap to government jobs, diplomatic appointments, State corporations and security services.\n\nThe Kibaki-Odinga feud caused divisions in Kibaki\u2019s first Cabinet. It was in this scenario that Tuju, and former vice presidents Moody Awori and George Saitoti switched allegiance to Kibaki.\n\nThe gap between Odinga\u2019s camp and Kibaki\u2019s was further widened by their divergent stances on constitutional reforms. Odinga\u2019s faction used the 2005 proposed Constitution referendum to get even with Kibaki. They rallied their supporters to reject the proposed Constitution. Odinga and his supporters wanted an autonomous premier with a ceremonial president while Kibaki and his supporters wanted the opposite of this arrangement. The government lost the referendum.\n\nA day after the government lost the plebiscite something historical happened. Kibaki fired his Cabinet save for Vice President Awori and Attorney General Amos Wako. In his terse message to Kenyans, Kibaki clarified that the referendum results had prompted him to reshuffle his ministers and assistant ministers for harmony and efficient service delivery to the people.\n\nIn the new Cabinet that he announced a fortnight later, he excluded Odinga (Roads, Public Works and Housing), Kalonzo Musyoka (Environment), Ochilo Ayacko (Gender and Sports), Linah Jebii Kilimo (Home Affairs and Registration of Persons), Anyang\u2019 Nyong\u2019o (Planning and National Development), Najib Balala (National Heritage and Culture) and William ole Ntimama (Office of the President \u2014 Public Service).\n\nIn the new Cabinet Kibaki appointed Tuju Minister for Foreign Affairs. From a purely bureaucratic point of view, Tuju\u2019s brief was to advance the government\u2019s foreign policy. But from a political angle, Kibaki\u2019s elevation of Tuju to the Foreign Affairs docket was a strategic move. Empowering Tuju was one of Kibaki\u2019s ways preparing for the 2007 political duel with Odinga.\n\nIn the run up to the 2005 referendum Tuju formed the People\u2019s Progressive Party. Political analysts considered Tuju\u2019s party an outfit whose aim was to eat into Odinga\u2019s support base and consequently reduce Odinga\u2019s camp\u2019s chances of winning the referendum.\n\nTuju served as the Minister for Foreign Affairs until the end of the first term of the Kibaki Presidency.\n\nExplains his fallout\n\nInterestingly, Tuju, who served as the Member of Parliament for Rarieda between 2003 and 2007, got into Narc thanks to his affiliation with Odinga\u2019s Liberal Democratic Party (LDP). This explains why his fallout with Odinga resulted in him losing the Rarieda seat. The political animosity between him and Odinga worked to his disadvantage since the electorate considered it a betrayal to their community kingpin.\n\nIn spite of his loss at the 2007 polls, Tuju did not slide into a political oblivion. In a demonstration of the high regard which President Kibaki had for him, Tuju was appointed as Special Envoy and Presidential adviser in the government. Tuju worked alongside Kivutha Kibwana. Whereas Kibwana advised Kibaki on Constitutional affairs, Tuju advised him on Media and Management of diversity or Ethnic Relations.\n\nTuju served Kibaki as one of his advisers until 2011 when he resigned to focus on his 2013 Presidential bid. Afterwards, he formed Party of Action (POA), the political vehicle through which he purposed to run for the Presidency.\n\nTuju was born on March 30, 1959. He went to Majiwa Primary School from where he joined Starehe Boys\u2019 Centre. Tuju holds a Master of Arts degree in Communication from the University of Leicester, United Kingdom. Before joining politics, Tuju worked as a consultant in design and implementation of public communication programmes. Among other organisations and agencies he consulted for were the World Health Organization (WHO), the United States Agency for International Development (USAid), the World Bank, the Department of International Development (DfID) and the United Nations Development Programme (UNDP). Between 1992 and 2001, Tuju was the Founder and Director, Ace Communications.", "articleBodyHtml": "<article>\n\n<p><strong>Jubilee Party Secretary-General Raphael Tuju rose from a KBC news anchor to a Cabinet Minister.

Murgor accuses the DPP of conducting a shoddy probe to shield Gender-Based Violence perpetrators", "articleBody": "The Federation of Women Lawyers Kenya (FIDA-Kenya) has written to the Office of the Director of Prosecutions (ODPP) to conduct a fresh probe into the assault case involving the two sisters linked to the Ole Sereni Hotel incident with Paul Ndichu and Edward Ndichu.\n\nIn a letter dated December 10, FIDA-Kenya executive director Anne Ireri has accused the DPP of conducting shoddy and skewed investigations in favour of the Ndichu brothers and Munyra Hassan Mohammed and called for fresh investigations.\n\n\u201cFIDA-Kenya being dissatisfied with the outcome of the investigations so far would like a review of this matter with the DPP to understand why it failed to exercise its mandate,\u201d said Ireri.\n\nStephanie and Cheryl had in October accused Ndichu brothers of assault and malicious damage at the basement of the Emara Ole Sereni Hotel, Nairobi.\n\nAccording to Ireri, the outcome of the ODPP investigations have disregarded the constitutional rights of Stephanie Murgor and Cheryl Murgor despite the compelling evidence they provided against the Ndichu brothers and Munyra.\n\nFIDA also took issues with a letter by the ODPP dated December 9 that order the Murgor sisters who were the accusers to take plea in the case.\n\nThe DPP ordered Stephanie, 24 and her sister Cheryl 22 to be charged with fighting in public and assault.\n\n\u201cWe have been seized of your letter dated December 9, and would like to take issue with the manner the investigations are

The major source of stress is finances because we do not have an economy where basic needs are not a struggle,\u201d she says.\n\nTamara Ochieng, also a psychologist, says, \u201cSome people may feel anxiously depressed around holidays due to seasonal affective disorder (SAD), thus resulting in excessive drinking, overeating and insomnia.\u201d\n\nThe symptoms of seasonal affective disorder include tiredness, fatigue, depression, crying spells and mood swings, irritability, trouble concentrating, body aches, loss of sex drive, decreased activity levels and overeating with associated weight gain.\n\nOchieng also lists unrealistic expectations and excessive commitments as another set of contributing factors. Others are impulse indulgences, competition to outdo others, poor planning, peer pressure and taking loans, hiring cars to fund vacations and stretching finances via short-term \u2018retail therapy.\u2019\n\nHolidays also come with loneliness after breaking away from colleagues, neighbours and friends and festivities are also ruined by recent trauma, life changes or concurrent illness.\n\nPeople who do not view themselves as depressed may develop stress responses marked by increased headaches, excessive drinking, overeating and insomnia during the holiday season.\n\n\u201cWe can be looking all successful and happy on the outside and still be overwhelmed and dying inside,\u201d says Susan Kibe, a psychologist and counsellor.\n\nShe adds that financial demands associated with demand for holiday festive needs usually trigger fear, anxiety, phobia, stress, depression, and mental health problems.\n\nStressful family situations and illness in the family are also predisposing factors and balancing the demands of shopping, parties, family obligations, and house guests may contribute to feelings of being overwhelmed and increased tension.\n\nWomen get stressed more as they put in feelings while men flow freely with the tide of events.\n\n\u201cWomen always want perfection,\u201d says Okello, \u201cand depending on the kind of plan they have, women will look for more details and better results than men.\u201d\n\nKibe says holiday stress affects women, men and children alike, considering there is serious demand and little money to afford the supply from breadwinners.\n\nThis always has negative impact as failure to meet financial demands and resultant obligations often leads to family breakdowns, separations, divorce.\n\nSo, what to do?\n\nWell, for starters, there are hobbies; sports, games, movies, books, socialising with family and friends.\n\nBut as for pressure to go upcountry, Okello says mobile money has come to the rescue and \u201cpeople can make calls and send finance rather than travel.\u201d\n\nOf nosy aunties who pester and cause untold stress on people\u2019s marital status, Okello says, \u201cThe aunties who ask questions are not nosy, they are in their developmental stage and they are looking back at the results of their lives and those of their siblings. All they think about is babies, husbands, returns and wives.\u201d\n\nTo make the most out of festivities, she says, people should do what they can the best way they can and if that means shelving travelling upcountry and not going out for parents with schoolchildren, so be it.\n\nKibe advises that people do things they enjoy the most besides indulging in fresh air, sunshine and stress relieving nutrition normally sacrificed during busy work times.\n\n\u201cDon\u2019t over think about how, when and where you will get rent and school feels in January when the December holiday is over,\u201d she says.\n\nThose suffering from holiday anxieties should set realistic goals and expectations, reach out to friends, share tasks, find inexpensive enjoyments, help others.\n\nBut other people also experience post-holiday sadness after New Year, which \u201ccan result from built-up expectations and disappointments from the previous year, coupled with stress and fatigue,\u201d says Dr Rupen Haria, a pharmaceutical distributor.\n\nDr Haria says a healthcare professional may perform lab or other tests and a full history of symptoms is likely to provide clues that can help distinguish a mild case of the holiday blues from sad or a more serious and chronic depressive disorder.", "articleBodyHtml": "<article>\n\n<figure><img alt=\"\" src=\"https://cdn.standardmedia.co.ke/images/sunday/ohadzototcn3xof61b5f92eec81f.jpg\">\n<figcaption>\u00a0\n<p>Women get stressed more as they put in feelings while men flow freely with the tide of events.

Others are impulse indulgences, competition to outdo others, poor planning, peer pressure and taking loans, hiring cars to fund vacations and stretching finances via short-term \u2018retail therapy.\u2019</p>\n\n<p>Holidays also come with loneliness after breaking away from colleagues, neighbours and friends and festivities are also ruined by recent trauma, life changes or concurrent illness.</p>\n\n<p>People who do not view themselves as depressed may develop stress responses marked by increased headaches, excessive drinking, overeating and insomnia during the holiday season.</p>\n\n<p>\u201cWe can be looking all successful and happy on the outside and still be overwhelmed and dying inside,\u201d says Susan Kibe, a psychologist and counsellor.</p>\n\n<p>She adds that financial demands associated with demand for holiday festive needs usually trigger fear, anxiety, phobia, stress, depression, and mental health problems.</p>\n\n<p>Stressful family situations and illness in the family are also predisposing factors and balancing the demands of shopping, parties, family obligations, and house guests may contribute to feelings of being overwhelmed and increased tension.</p>\n\n<p>Women get stressed more as they put in feelings while men flow freely with the tide of events.</p>\n\n<p>\u201cWomen always want perfection,\u201d says Okello, \u201cand depending on the kind of plan they have, women will look for more details and better results than men.\u201d</p>\n\n<p>Kibe says holiday stress affects women, men and children alike, considering there is serious demand and little money to afford the supply from breadwinners.</p>\n\n<p>This always has negative impact as failure to meet financial demands and resultant obligations often leads to family breakdowns, separations, divorce.</p>\n\n<figure><img alt=\"\" src=\"https://cdn.standardmedia.co.ke/images/sunday/opsfihefuf14sj61b64e810e010.jpg\">\n<figcaption>\u00a0\n<p>To make the most out of festivities, people should do what they can the best way they can.

All they think about is babies, husbands, returns and wives.\u201d</p>\n\n<p>To make the most out of festivities, she says, people should do what they can the best way they can and if that means shelving travelling upcountry and not going out for parents with schoolchildren, so be it.</p>\n\n<p>Kibe advises that people do things they enjoy the most besides indulging in fresh air, sunshine and stress relieving nutrition normally sacrificed during busy work times.</p>\n\n<p>\u201cDon\u2019t over think about how, when and where you will get rent and school feels in January when the December holiday is over,\u201d she says.</p>\n\n<p>Those suffering from holiday anxieties should set realistic goals and expectations, reach out to friends, share tasks, find inexpensive enjoyments, help others.</p>\n\n<p>But other people also experience post-holiday sadness after New Year, which \u201ccan result from built-up expectations and disappointments from the previous year, coupled with stress and fatigue,\u201d says Dr Rupen Haria, a pharmaceutical distributor.</p>\n\n<p>Dr Haria says a healthcare professional may perform lab or other tests and a full history of symptoms is likely to provide clues that can help distinguish a mild case of the holiday blues from sad or a more serious and chronic depressive disorder.</p>\n\n</article>", "canonicalUrl": "https://www.standardmedia.co.ke/health/health-science/article/2001431660/holiday-stress-can-lower-sex-drive"},{"url": "https://www.standardmedia.co.ke/health/article/2001431667/why-you-throw-up-on-long-safaris", "probability": 0.98446953, "headline": "Why you throw up on long safaris", "datePublished": "2021-12-13T03:30:00+03:00", "datePublishedRaw": "Mon,Dec 13 2021 03:30:00 EAT", "dateModified": "2021-12-13T03:30:00+03:00", "dateModifiedRaw": "Mon,Dec 13 2021 03:30:00 EAT", "author": "ROSA AGUTU | Mon,Dec 13 2021 03:30:00 EAT", "authorsList": ["ROSA AGUTU | Mon", "Dec 13 2021 03:30:00 EAT"], "inLanguage": "en", "mainImage": "https://cdn.standardmedia.co.ke/images/sunday/aza7nclihizqh5j61b60058d6059.jpg", "images": ["https://cdn.standardmedia.co.ke/images/sunday/aza7nclihizqh5j61b60058d6059.jpg", "https://cdn.standardmedia.co.ke/images/sunday/gxuxincjujkzi861b64ff07217d.jpg"], "description": "If you vomit or spot someone in a session of discomfiture, just know that it is the brain trying to save a life.", "articleBody": "The festive season is here when social media is awash with travelling updates and pictures of holiday locations.

He was widely regarded as the absolute political monarch in Mombasa and much of the Coast Province.\n\nKenyan newspapers often described him as the \u201cKanu Mombasa supremo\u201d in reference to his colossal political weight. To his detractors within and outside Kanu, Nassir personified the party\u2019s ultra-conservative structure.\n\nFor instance, in March 1999 he came up with a controversial suggestion that Moi should stay in power beyond his constitutionally mandated two terms of five years each.\n\nNassir became Mombasa Kanu branch chairman after Ronald Ngala\u2019s death in 1972. He would later contest the Mvita parliamentary seat and triumph over Mohamed Jahazi, who had established himself as a powerhouse in Mombasa politics.\n\nStill, it took many years before Nassir, Moi\u2019s close friend, could land a ministerial flag. He, however, served as an assistant minister in several ministries.\n\nMany people attribute Moi\u2019s reluctance to appoint him to the Cabinet to his relatively low level of education and inability to effectively communicate in English.\n\nAs an assistant minister, however, Nassir wielded as much political power as any minister of his time. For instance in 1980, while working as assistant minister for Labour, Nassir moved to assert himself in the labour movement by orchestrating the ouster of perceived critics.\n\nFor obvious reasons, including turf wars, Nassir disliked Juma Boy, a powerhouse in the Coast labour movement. Therefore, when Nassir was appointed to the ministry, he immediately targeted Boy with the singular intention of crippling his hold on the Mombasa Dockworkers\u2019 Union. Boy was eventually ousted from the union.\n\nNassir landed his first full ministerial appointment in February 1998, following the December 1997 General Election, thereby joining Hussein Maalim Mohamed as the only Muslim ministers in the Cabinet.\n\nBesides, his appointment was seen as a reward for the role he evidently played in boosting the fortunes of the ruling party in Mombasa. Of his Cabinet appointment, the The Weekly Review, wrote:\n\n\u201cIndeed, if there is any political leader in the country who has been totally committed to his boss, the government and the ruling party, Kanu, then it is the Mvita legislator, who has been one of the most outspoken defenders of the political establishment against all detractors, both local and foreign.\u201d\n\nNonetheless, when it came to matters concerning Kanu, Nassir was unmatched. The late 1990s saw Kanu\u2019s popularity swell in the Coast region. Kanu won 18 out of the 21 parliamentary seats in Coast Province.\n\nIt, however, was sometimes difficult to understand Nassir\u2019s ways. Although perceived as the president\u2019s mouthpiece, he had a way of confounding all and sundry by appearing to speak at variance with his boss.\n\nHis critics often demanded his sacking from the Cabinet owing to his odd utterances that ignited the mood of the public as well as the party. For instance, majimbo (regionalism), a loose form of political federalism, was his pet topic.\n\nHe never lost any opportunity to attack those who maligned this form of governance, as he believed it to be the panacea to Kenya\u2019s problem of negative ethnicity. He once threatened to move the Coast people out of Kanu to a regional political party were the country to resist majimbo.\n\nYet, instructively, Nassir wasn\u2019t really concerned about good governance and tribal equity in sharing national resources. Essentially, he was among a group of diehard politicians who appeared to believe that the Kikuyu community was so dominant in politics and business that it needed to be contained.\n\nOthers who shared this opinion included his Cabinet colleagues William ole Ntimama and Francis Lotodo. The media described them as \u2018tribal warlords\u2019; they didn\u2019t seem to mind this deprecating tag.\n\nThere is, interestingly, hardly any information on record to quantify Nassir\u2019s achievements in the Cabinet. Apparently, his role was not meant to add value to the management of the government. Rather, it was designed to strengthen Kanu and to stabilise the Coast region \u2013 a feat he achieved very well.\n\nNassir is on record as having demanded that Kanu take action against Mombasa West MP Kennedy Kiliku for statements he uttered in Parliament. Kiliku had complained about the terrible condition of roads in his constituency, but Nassir felt the legislator was laying bare the failings of Moi\u2019s government.\n\nIt took the person of Deputy Speaker Samuel arap Ng\u2019eny to remind Nassir that parliamentary statements were privileged and that MPs enjoyed immunity for whatever they said in the House.\n\nNot happy with the ruling, Nassir would later call for an amendment of the Powers and Privileges Act to entrench Kanu\u2019s supremacy. It was reminiscent of the 1975 situation when MPs Martin Shikuku and Jean-Marie Seroney were detained for declaring in Parliament, \u201cKanu is dead.\u201d\n\nNassir did not have it all easy. Apart from the many brickbats thrown at him at the national level, he smothered a number of coups at the Mombasa Kanu branch.\n\nBut the slide that eventually saw him finally elbowed out of the political landscape started in 1995. The architect of the downfall was none other than Moi himself.\n\nFaced with a more energetic and youthful opposition within and outside of Kanu, Moi had to reform the ruling party even as he appeased the public that he was out to transform the country\u2019s politics.\n\nThe opposition was eating into Kanu\u2019s support base; the young people in Kanu were becoming restless and were demanding bigger roles in the party.\n\nThat year, 1995, Moi urged Nassir to let young leaders take over leadership of the party. The president who, ironically, was older than Nassir and had been in politics longer, had an eye on Rashid Sajjad, a tycoon who was obviously younger than Nassir.\n\nBut the real reason Moi wanted Sajjad in the limelight was not chiefly that the young man was a worthwhile replacement for Nassir. Hardly. Multi-billionaire Sajjad could bankroll the forthcoming 1997 elections at the Coast. Ultimately, Moi chose Sajjad over Nassir to be the Kanu coordinator for Coast region in the 1997 elections.\n\nFor Nassir, the die had been cast. He was not elected at the grassroots level and therefore couldn\u2019t defend his party seat. This time round the tactic he used to steamroll rivals was employed against him.\n\nSajjad would later wield great influence at the Coast until Kanu, alongside Nassir, was removed from power in December 2002.\n\nAs difficult as it is to quantify Nassir\u2019s successes as a Cabinet member, putting a figure to his wealth is near impossible.\n\nAccording to Arye Oded in the book Islam and Politics in Kenya, Nassir \u201c\u2026(showed) an uncompromising ambition to be the only well-known Muslim political leader in Mombasa and the coastal region and to be the decisive influence in the coastal branch of the party, the municipality and in the trade unions\u201d.", "articleBodyHtml": "<article>\n\n<figure><img src=\"https://cdn.standardmedia.co.ke/images/sunday/shsne8epctgxs5f8352cb0b9be.jpg\">\n<figcaption><strong>Mombasa central MP Shariff Nassir is carried shoulder high by his supporters. </strong></figcaption></figure>\n\n<p>Shariff Nassir bin Taib was the most voluble politician in the then Coast Province, perhaps even in Kenya, during President Daniel arap Moi\u2019s regime.</p>\n\n<p>The <a href=\"https://www.standardmedia.co.ke/sunday-magazine/article/2001300665/people-thought-i-was-my-wifes-father\">Mvita MP</a>, who rose from a clerk before joining politics and serving as a minister, was vocal and known to comment on anything and everything under the sun.</p>\n\n<p>Nassir even threw caution to the wind once and reminded those opposed to the president that the political party Kanu would rule for another 100 years.</p>\n\n<p>Indeed, he was known for what many believed were utterances that actually reflected official thinking within the corridors of power. He was widely regarded as the absolute political monarch in Mombasa and much of the Coast Province.</p>\n\n<p>Kenyan newspapers often described him as the \u201cKanu Mombasa supremo\u201d in reference to his colossal political weight. To his detractors within and outside Kanu, Nassir personified the party\u2019s ultra-conservative structure.</p>\n\n<p>For instance, in March 1999 he came up with a controversial suggestion that Moi should stay in power beyond his constitutionally mandated two terms of five years each.</p>\n\n<p>Nassir became Mombasa Kanu branch chairman after Ronald Ngala\u2019s death in 1972. He would later contest the Mvita parliamentary seat and triumph over Mohamed Jahazi, who had established himself as a powerhouse in <a href=\"https://www.standardmedia.co.ke/index.php/education/article/2001299577/mp-wishes-mvita-candidates-success\">Mombasa politics</a>.</p>\n\n<p>Still, it took many years before Nassir, Moi\u2019s close friend, could land a ministerial flag. He, however, served as an assistant minister in several ministries.</p>\n\n<p>Many people attribute Moi\u2019s reluctance to appoint him to the Cabinet to his relatively low level of education and inability to effectively communicate in English.</p>\n\n<p>As an assistant minister, however, Nassir wielded as much political power as any minister of his time. For instance in 1980, while working as assistant minister for Labour, Nassir moved to assert himself in the labour movement by orchestrating the ouster of perceived critics.</p>\n\n<p>For obvious reasons, including turf wars, Nassir disliked Juma Boy, a powerhouse in the Coast labour movement. Therefore, when Nassir was appointed to the ministry, he immediately targeted Boy with the singular intention of crippling his hold on the Mombasa Dockworkers\u2019 Union. Boy was eventually ousted from the union.</p>\n\n<p>Nassir landed his first full ministerial appointment in February 1998, following the December 1997 General Election, thereby joining Hussein Maalim Mohamed as the only Muslim ministers in the Cabinet.</p>\n\n<p>Besides, his appointment was seen as a reward for the role he evidently played in boosting the fortunes of the ruling party in Mombasa. Of his Cabinet appointment, the\u00a0<em>The Weekly Review</em>, wrote:</p>\n\n<p>\u201cIndeed, if there is any political leader in the country who has been totally committed to his boss, the government and the ruling party, Kanu, then it is the Mvita legislator, who has been one of the most outspoken defenders of the political establishment against all detractors, both local and foreign.\u201d</p>\n\n<p>Nonetheless, when it came to matters concerning Kanu, <a href=\"https://www.standardmedia.co.ke/index.php/coast/article/2000129739/mp-weeps-in-public-over-rampant-insecurity-in-mombasa\">Nassir was unmatched</a>. The late 1990s saw Kanu\u2019s popularity swell in the Coast region. Kanu won 18 out of the 21 parliamentary seats in Coast Province.</p>\n\n<p>It, however, was sometimes difficult to understand Nassir\u2019s ways. Although perceived as the president\u2019s mouthpiece, he had a way of confounding all and sundry by appearing to speak at variance with his boss.</p>\n\n<p>His critics often demanded his sacking from the Cabinet owing to his odd utterances that ignited the mood of the public as well as the party. For instance, majimbo (regionalism), a loose form of political federalism, was his pet topic.</p>\n\n<p>He never lost any opportunity to attack those who maligned this form of governance, as he believed it to be the panacea to Kenya\u2019s problem of negative ethnicity. He once threatened to move the Coast people out of Kanu to a regional political party were the country to resist majimbo.</p>\n\n<p>Yet, instructively, Nassir wasn\u2019t really concerned about good governance and tribal equity in sharing national resources. Essentially, he was among a group of diehard politicians who appeared to believe that the Kikuyu community was so dominant in politics and business that it needed to be contained.</p>\n\n<p>Others who shared this opinion included his Cabinet colleagues William ole Ntimama and Francis Lotodo. The media described them as \u2018tribal warlords\u2019; they didn\u2019t seem to mind this deprecating tag.</p>\n\n<p>There is, interestingly, hardly any information on record to quantify Nassir\u2019s achievements in the Cabinet. Apparently, his role was not meant to add value to the management of the government. Rather, it was designed to strengthen Kanu and to stabilise the Coast region \u2013 a feat he achieved very well.</p>\n\n<p>Nassir is on record as having demanded that Kanu take action against Mombasa West MP Kennedy Kiliku for statements he uttered in Parliament.

Luckily when we briefly stopped at Serena Hotel, we bumped into Nicholas Biwott and my mind clicked,\u201d Kittony recalls.\n\nAt the back of her mind she had been struggling to recollect the name of a prominent don who lectured at Egerton University. Upon setting her eyes on Biwott, the final pieces of the puzzle gnawing at her mind fell into place.\n\nShe mischievously asked Biwott to remind her of the name of the don, and the former powerful Cabinet minister obliged. He and Margaret Kamar were romantically connected and he was more than happy to provide her contacts.\n\n\u201cBiwott called Kamar and introduced the topic and when we talked to her, she agreed to our proposal.

They felt vindicated when they later escorted Kamar and Rose Waruhiu, Democratic Party\u2019s nominee, to take their Oath of Office in Arusha, Tanzania.\n\nThis was not the first time Kittony had tempted fate.

Unknown to us he had spies who leaked my movement. I was intercepted and given a thorough beating. I later learnt the folly of what I had set out to do,\u201d she said.\n\nChesire is the man who took young Moi under his wings and tutored him in religion. When Moi was ready to start his life, Kittony was taken in by the young newly married couple.\n\n\u201cMzee was living in our home. I knew him from the day I was born and he had a great impact in my life,\u201d recalls Kittony.\n\nIt is this nurturing and the sound education Kittony got while growing up under the watchful eyes of the former president that shaped the adventurous girl into a champion for women rights.\n\nGrowing in the shadow of the Second World War and polarising struggle for freedom, Kittony experienced the pains of a modern African woman, trying to unshackle the manacles of harmful traditions and a patriarchal society.\n\nShe recalls her excitement when in 1980 President Moi made it possible for women to have national identity cards, opening doors of property ownership hitherto slammed shut by male chauvinistic society. Looking back to those days, Kittony is convinced that the country has made great strides in empowering the woman.\n\nThe leader, who steered Maendelelo ya Wanawake for 11 years, credits Moi for having a sympathetic ear for women issues from the time he disbanded Women Service Corps in 1979.\n\nThis she explains was a tool used for discrimination because female officers had to swear they would not marry or get children while in the service.

But after many hours, his prayers were answered.\n\nHis wife Beatrice Nyindombi would live. So too would the little bundle that had triggered all the panic. And for her trouble, she would be named after her mother, Beatrice.\n\nMany years later, to ease the confusion in the family, the daughter\u2019s name would be shortened to just three letters. That is how Bea Wanjiru Karanja came to be.\n\n\u201cIt was a difficult birth. That is why my father had chosen the name Beatrice for me so that in the event my mother succumbed, he could still have me. In the event I too had died, every time he called my mother\u2019s name, he would remember me,\u201d says Bea.\n\nWhat a joy it was for a mason\u2019s son, Josephat Njuguna Karanja, who had gone to Britain to study and ended up being Kenya\u2019s first ambassador to London in 1963, where he met Nyindombi, a nursing student who later gave him two daughters and a son. Trickier situations would dog the diplomat later in life.\n\nHis London posting also brought him new friends and some powerful foes who would later try to make his life miserable.\n\nAlthough Karanja the diplomat, don and politician has been dead for 26 years, his life and times in politics epitomise the paradox of Kenya\u2019s politics and the curse of the country\u2019s past and current vice presidents and deputy president.\n\nHis life also mirrors the illusion that is political power, which like a tornado, blows powerfully all in its way and then dissipates like a weak breeze on a hot night, impotent and ineffective.\n\nToday, the white tombstone beckoning form raised ground along a well-paved path off Kenyatta Road leading to Gatundu, promises a story of a man who was once great.\n\nBut the overhanging bougainvillea twigs embrace the pathway in a stranglehold, discouraging strangers from delving too deep in his family secrets.\n\nThis is no ordinary tombstone. Underneath lies Kenya\u2019s fifth vice president and his secrets that have been resting here since 1994 when he died.\n\nThe security detail that once strutted in and out of his coffee estate and demanded that his children book appointments before seeing their father and await official invitation before attending his functions are long gone.\n\nLocked in the cobwebs of history are the memories of the diplomat-turned-politician who was once accused of ordering politicians to kneel before him. Dr Karanja was picked to replace Mwai Kibaki as vice president in 1988.\n\nHe was a creature of controversy and his short stint as Kenya\u2019s second most powerful man ended ignominiously when in his own words \u201ccommon decency was thrown out of the window and replaced with political thuggery\u201d.\n\nIronically, he contested and won Mathare parliamentary seat after its occupant, Andrew Kimani Ngumba, was hounded out of office and had to flee the country for fear of being detained.\n\nKaranja too was felled by his own sword, opting to resign as the vice president just one year after assuming office rather than be dragged through political muck. He was accused of behaving like a demi-god by Kuria Kanyingi, a lowly motor vehicle inspector.\n\nThen the cantankerous Embakasi MP, David Mwenje, assigned himself the role of bringing down the bespectacled giant. He named Karanja in Parliament, leading to the formation of a commission of inquiry to hear how Karanja had misused his powers.\n\nIt was a devil\u2019s alternative. Whatever option the diplomat took, he would lose one or both. And in a split second, he made a compromise with fate, and both friend and foe were baffled for decades to come.\n\nKaranja\u2019s successor, George Saitoti, another don, would also be humiliated and he too, would quit in a huff in March 2002. This was after the realisation that he was not a heartbeat away from the presidency as he had assumed, having served as President Daniel Moi \u2019s vice president for 13 years.\n\nKaranja\u2019s once lush Crops Estate along Kenyatta Road is unrecognisable. The 500-metre driveway his limousines cruised along as he came to inspect his thriving horticulture side hustle has been dented by trucks ferrying building material.\n\nA few metres from his gate is a sign proclaiming an upcoming housing estate, which is nearing completion. The developer has constructed the bungalows just next to Karanja\u2019s final resting place.\n\nWhen we visited his estate or what remains of it, last week, a young man who introduced himself to us as Njuguna Karanja, the former vice president\u2019s grandson, said he was unaware of the estate\u2019s former name. He had to enquire from his father, Timothy Karanja, who was resting in one of the farmhouses.\n\nPlease understand\n\nWhen he came with an answer, the young man first demanded to know why we were interested in his grandfather but mellowed when told that it was for a historical piece.\n\nApparently, the betrayal Karanja suffered as a politician still haunts the family and runs deep.\n\nNjuguna was just about to lead us to his grandfather\u2019s grave when his mother, who introduced herself as Waceke, drove into the compound in a red Mercedes Benz.\n\nAfter introductions, Waceke laughed off our questions and said: \u201cMzee is resting there in peace. Just let him rest. I do not think it is a good idea to write about him.\u201d\n\nWhen informed that her husband, Timothy, had given us an appointment the following morning, she smiled knowingly and said: \u201cI wish you luck. You can come tomorrow but you must call first.\u201d With that she shooed us out without volunteering her husband\u2019s contacts.\n\nWhen we called later, Timothy was not enthusiastic about a press interview and declared: \u201cI do not want to talk about my father. Please understand.\u201d\n\nHe was equally cagey when asked how his mother, Beatrice Nyindombi, could be contacted.\n\n\u201cI cannot give you my mother\u2019s contact. Thanks for calling,\u201d he said as he terminated the call.\n\nEarlier in the week, when Timothy learnt that the Sunday Standard was interested in his father\u2019s story, he was reluctant to meet the team. However, he begrudgingly gave us a date on a Friday. His directions led to Githiga, past Ndumberi in Githunguri, Kiambu County, where his father once duelled with Arthur Magugu.\n\nAt Githiga, Timothy was nowhere to be seen. His 52-year-old cousin, Josephat Njuguna Muiruri, was surprised, saying he could not remember when he last saw him.\n\nBut Muiruri had glowing memories of his uncle, whom he credited for paying his school fees when he was in college in Thika.\n\n\u201cHe was like a father to me. He was so generous and loving. He is the one who bought my grandmother Mine Wagikuyu this piece of land which I now call home,\u201d he said.\n\nThe vice president\u2019s only surviving sister, Nancy Wanjiru, who is now 75 years old, attests to Dr Karanja\u2019s generosity, saying as the eldest son, he took up leadership of the household very early after the death of their father, Njuguna Wa Mieru.\n\n\u201cHe bought my mother two acres of land at Gatitu village. He then constructed her a beautiful stone house. Every Christmas he could organise a huge family gathering. In fact, he bought all his six brothers land,\u201d Wanjiru said.\n\nThe Christmas family get-together are still fresh in Bea\u2019s memory. The daughter also recalls how her doting father insulated them from politics and took them to different cities in Europe.\n\n\u201cI still recall how odd it felt being prevented from getting close to your father in public. We could only attend his events if we had been booked. You could not ride in his vehicle with him but that is what happens when you are so close to power,\u201d she says.\n\nWanjiru says Karanja bought her a piece of land in Ruiru. The nucleus family too was not left in want.\n\nThe former vice president was not a pauper. When the High Court on March 19, 2014, made a verdict of how his estate was to be shared, it was clear he was a man of means.\n\nHe had parcels of land in New Muthaiga, Thika, Ruiru, Changamwe and Kiambu as well as 100 acres in Kajiado. All the property, according to an agreement reached during the succession case was shared out among the widow, son Timothy and daughter Beatrice Wanjiru.\n\nThe ties that once bound the family are no more but Karanja is still remembered fondly.\n\nAlthough some people have claimed that Karanja was aloof, his family and residents of Githunguri still remember him as a humble man who once penned an application letter in Gikuyu, entreating them to vote for him as an MP.\n\nThe undated application letter reads in part: \u201cI greet you together with all members of your family. This letter is to notify you that I am seeking to be your MP in Githunguri. I beseech you to vote for me when elections come so that I can be your voice in Parliament.\u201d\n\nHe signed off the letter just, \u201ctigwo na thayu wa Ngai. Ninii murataggwo, JN Karanja (May the peace of God be with you. This is your sincere friend\u2026.)\u201d\n\nIn the personalised letter, Karanja had included a short resume detailing how he had been Kenya\u2019s first high commissioner to the UK and later served as Mzee Jomo Kenyatta\u2019s representative in the Vatican. He later headed the University of Nairobi as vice chancellor for nine years from 1970 to 1979.", "articleBodyHtml": "<article>\n\n<figure><img src=\"https://cdn.standardmedia.co.ke/images/sunday/khmxcxgp74sj9h5j5f82e1a3167d3.jpg\">\n<figcaption><strong>Portrait of former vice president Dr Josephat Karanja</strong>.

He is the one who bought my grandmother Mine Wagikuyu this piece of land which I now call home,\u201d he said.</p>\n\n<p>The vice president\u2019s only surviving sister, Nancy Wanjiru, who is now 75 years old, attests to Dr Karanja\u2019s generosity, saying as the eldest son, he took up leadership of the household very early after the death of their father, Njuguna Wa Mieru.</p>\n\n<p>\u201cHe bought my mother two acres of land at Gatitu village. He then constructed her a beautiful stone house. Every Christmas he could organise a huge family gathering. In fact, he bought all his six brothers land,\u201d Wanjiru said.</p>\n\n<p>The Christmas family get-together are still fresh in Bea\u2019s memory. The daughter also recalls how her doting father insulated them from politics and took them to different cities in Europe.</p>\n\n<p>\u201cI still recall how odd it felt being prevented from getting close to your father in public. We could only attend his events if we had been booked. You could not ride in his vehicle with him but that is what happens when you are so close to power,\u201d she says.</p>\n\n<p>Wanjiru says Karanja bought her a piece of land in Ruiru. The nucleus family too was not left in want.</p>\n\n<p>The former vice president was not a pauper. When the High Court on March 19, 2014, made a verdict of how his estate was to be shared, it was clear he was a man of means.</p>\n\n<p>He had parcels of land in New Muthaiga, Thika, Ruiru, Changamwe and Kiambu as well as 100 acres in Kajiado. All the property, according to an agreement reached during the succession case was shared out among the widow, son Timothy and daughter Beatrice Wanjiru.</p>\n\n<p>The ties that once bound the family are no more but Karanja is still remembered fondly.</p>\n\n<p>Although some people have claimed that Karanja was aloof, his family and residents of Githunguri still remember him as a humble man who once penned an application letter in Gikuyu, entreating them to vote for him as an MP.</p>\n\n<p>The undated application letter reads in part: \u201cI greet you together with all members of your family. This letter is to notify you that I am seeking to be your MP in Githunguri. I beseech you to vote for me when elections come so that I can be your voice in Parliament.\u201d</p>\n\n<p>He signed off the letter just, \u201ctigwo na thayu wa Ngai. Ninii murataggwo, JN Karanja (May the peace of God be with you. This is your sincere friend\u2026.)\u201d</p>\n\n<p>In the personalised letter, Karanja had included a short resume detailing how he had been Kenya\u2019s first high commissioner to the UK and later served as Mzee Jomo Kenyatta\u2019s representative in the Vatican. He later headed the University of Nairobi as vice chancellor for nine years from 1970 to 1979.</p>\n\n</article>", "canonicalUrl": "https://www.standardmedia.co.ke/moi-cabinets/article/2001389699/how-the-mighty-fall-the-story-of-joseph-karanja"},{"url": "https://www.standardmedia.co.ke/moi-cabinets/article/2001389504/james-njagi-njiru-kanu-strongman-who-had-the-presidents-ear", "probability": 0.984624, "headline": "James Njagi Njiru: The short-tempered man who had the President\u2019s ear", "datePublished": "2020-10-11T08:00:00+03:00", "datePublishedRaw": "Sun, 11 Oct 2020 08:00:00 EAT", "dateModified": "2020-10-11T08:00:00+03:00", "dateModifiedRaw": "Sun, 11 Oct 2020 08:00:00 EAT ", "author": "Standard Team", "authorsList": ["Standard Team"], "inLanguage": "en", "breadcrumbs": [{"name": "Home", "link": "https://www.standardmedia.co.ke"}, {"name": "Moi Cabinets", "link": "https://www.standardmedia.co.ke/category/571/moi-cabinets"}, {"name": "James Njagi Njiru: Kanu strongman who had the President\u2019s ear", "link": "https://www.standardmedia.co.ke/moi-cabinets/article/2001389504/james-njagi-njiru-kanu-strongman-who-had-the-presidents-ear"}], "mainImage": "https://cdn.standardmedia.co.ke/images/friday/uhgxrojqn5f1hcno5f8068f067f2c.jpg", "images": ["https://cdn.standardmedia.co.ke/images/friday/uhgxrojqn5f1hcno5f8068f067f2c.jpg", "https://cdn.standardmedia.co.ke/images/friday/ulqfj7rspsjsz5f80694b117b8.jpg"], "description": "Njiru found his fellow MP having drinks with colleagues and shot at him, but the bullet missed its target.", "articleBody": "In his autobiography, Troubled But Not Destroyed, Rev David Gitari, who was the Anglican Bishop of Mt Kenya East Diocese, recounted a violent clash between James Njagi Njiru and his political rival, Nahashon Njuno.

My father had invited this group of eight members to our home in Bondo,\u201d Raila said in an interview on Wednesday.\n\nDecades later, the two men would often go toe to toe against each other\n\nFollowing the infamous August 1982 attempted coup, Raila was accused of complicity, charged with treason and subsequently detained for six years by President Moi\u2019s government. A biography released in 2006, as Raila was gearing up to contest the presidency in 2007, indicated that he was more involved in the attempted coup than he had previously admitted.\n\nWhen the book was published, leaders, especially his political nemesis called for his arrest. But the window in law of limitation had already passed and since the information was contained in a biography, it did not amount to an open confession.\n\nRaila\u2019s route to the Cabinet and beyond started when he joined elective politics after the re-introduction of multipartism in 1992, and he was elected as Member of Parliament for Lang\u2019ata constituency in Nairobi. He won the seat again in 1997 when he also vied for the presidency but lost to Moi. He retained the Lang\u2019ata seat in 2002 and 2007.\n\nRaila was identified with the country\u2019s so-called Second Liberation; notably, he was in jail for treason between 1982 and 1988 when the agitation for change was at its peak. He was released in June 1989 but incarcerated again in July 1990, together with Kenneth Matiba and Charles Rubia, for calling for the return of multiparty politics. He was released in June 1991 after which, fearing for his life, he fled to Norway.\n\nIn February 1992, Raila returned to Kenya and joined the Forum for the Restoration of Democracy (Ford) party which was led by his father Jaramogi Oginga Odinga. Later that year, when Ford split into Ford-Kenya (led by the senior Odinga) and Ford-Asili (led by Matiba), he was elected as the former\u2019s deputy director of elections.\n\nIn his first bid for the presidency in 1997, Raila finished third after Moi and the Democratic Party candidate Mwai Kibaki. In the lead up to the 2002 elections, he ditched a fragmented Opposition to join Moi\u2019s party, Kanu, in the hope that the president would anoint him as his successor. So in March 2001, having joined the National Development Party (NDP), he merged it with Kanu to form New Kanu.\n\nTo solemnise the marriage between the two parties, Moi gave Raila and a few other NDP leaders Cabinet positions. He was appointed Minister for Energy, a position he held from June 2001 to the last quarter of 2002 when Moi revealed his preferred candidate for the New Kanu 2002 presidential contest. It was Uhuru Kenyatta, the son of Kenya\u2019s first president, Jomo Kenyatta.\n\nRaila resigned on October 13, 2002, on the eve of a New Kanu meeting in Kasarani, Nairobi. It was the meeting at which Moi would officially announce his choice of successor.\n\nA previous meeting at the same venue when NDP joined Kanu in 2001 had made Raila the new party\u2019s secretary general, in effect sidelining Joseph Kamotho who had held that position for many years.\n\nTowards the end of 2002, Moi asked Raila and other presidential hopefuls in New Kanu to support Uhuru\u2019s campaigns, but this was unpalatable to them. When Raila left the party in a huff, he took with him his NDP brigade and a host of Kanu \u2018rebels\u2019 who had also expected to be named heirs to the throne. They included Kalonzo Musyoka, Kamotho and George Saitoti. The group went on to form the Rainbow Movement, which would later merge with Kibaki\u2019s National Alliance Party of Kenya (NAK) to form the National Rainbow Coalition (NARC), the political machine that defeated Moi\u2019s \u2018Project Uhuru\u2019 in the 2002 elections.\n\nAs soon as he joined NARC, Raila declared \u201cKibaki tosha\u201d (Kibaki is enough), thereby endorsing a candidate who had already been chosen by other Opposition leaders. This would be the declaration that signaled the defeat of \u2018Project Uhuru\u2019.\n\nRaila traversed the country campaigning for Kibaki, and when the presidential candidate was involved in an accident that left him indisposed just before the elections, he took the lead and delivered victory with an overwhelming majority of 67 per cent.\n\nPrior to the 2002 elections, there was apparently a Memorandum of Understanding that guaranteed Raila the prime minister\u2019s post and his Liberal Democratic Party (LDP) half the Cabinet posts once Kibaki took over power.\n\nBut this did not happen. Instead, the Cabinet was occupied by NAK and even a number of MPs from Opposition parties (Kanu and Ford-People). However, between 2003 and 2005, Raila and some of his lieutenants held key portfolios \u2014 he was Minister for Roads, Public Works and Housing, while James Orengo was appointed the Lands Minister.\n\nThe perceived betrayal of LDP by NAK started a quiet war, which in time led to an open rebellion and split the Cabinet. A key point of disagreement was a proposed new Constitution for the country, which was the campaign issue that had united NAK and LDP in the lead up to 2002 elections.\n\nKibaki\u2019s government instituted a constitutional committee that submitted a draft that was perceived to consolidate presidential powers and weaken regional administrations, contrary to the pre-election draft.\n\nRaila opposed this and when campaigns for putting the Draft Constitution to a referendum started, he and his LDP colleagues campaigned on the \u2018No\u2019 side, thereby rejecting it and opposing President Kibaki and his \u2018Yes\u2019 side. When the document was put to the vote in 2005, the government lost by 43 per cent to Raila\u2019s 57.\n\nA disappointed Kibaki sacked the entire Cabinet on November 23, 2005, and when it was reconstituted two weeks later, Raila and the LDP group were left out.\n\nHe then formed a new Opposition outfit, the Orange Democratic Movement (ODM) and went straight into campaigning for the 2007 presidential elections (orange fruit had been the symbol of the \u2018No\u2019 campaign during the referendum). However, in August 2007, ODM suffered a setback when it split into two \u2013 he became the head of ODM while Musyoka led the ODM-Kenya splinter faction.\n\nAt the ODM National Delegates Conference held at the Moi International Sports Centre in Kasarani in September 2007, Raila was elected the party\u2019s presidential candidate when he garnered 2,656 votes against his opponents, Mudavadi who got 391 votes, and William Ruto, who had 368. The defeated candidates expressed their support for the winner and Mudavadi was later named as his running mate.\n\nOn December 30, 2007, the Electoral Commission of Kenya declared Kibaki the winner of the presidential election, placing him ahead of Odinga by about 232,000 votes.\n\nThe Opposition, led by Raila, rejected the results and what followed was mass action that resulted in widespread violence and deaths. Over 1,300 Kenyans were killed and more than 250,000 displaced.\n\nThe tragedy attracted the attention of the international community. With the former United Nations Secretary-General Kofi Annan acting as mediator, a power-sharing deal created a Government of National Unity with Raila as the prime minister. He became Kenya\u2019s second prime minister after Jomo Kenyatta, who held the position from 1963 to 1964.\n\nLater, Raila would face the wrath of Kalenjin leaders because of his stand on those being investigated for crimes against humanity arising from the 2007-2008 violence\n\nRuto and two other Kalenjins were among those being investigated by the International Criminal Court (ICC).\n\nRaila would contest the presidency in 2013, this time under a new constitutional order that adopted a presidential system of governance.\n\nUnder the new winner-take-all format, those vying for the president and deputy president positions were not allowed to compete for any other political seats.\n\nHe made another stab at the top seat in 2017.", "articleBodyHtml": "<article>\n\n<figure><img src=\"https://cdn.standardmedia.co.ke/images/friday/qlunc1lync2uxs5f80a85ecdbc9.jpg\">\n<figcaption><strong>KANU, NDP merger.

As a trusted confidant of the President, Kariuki had expected a Cabinet post, but the one he ended up with was somewhat overwhelming in scope and responsibility.\n\nHe soon realised, however, that his power was in letter not in deed.

In two weeks he had nominated me to Parliament. I would later serve as an assistant minister,\u201d Kariuki recalled during the interview.\n\nThis story summed up the many ways in which Moi differed with, kicked out, and later reconciled with his \u2018enemies\u2019.\n\nISAAC OMOLO OKERO: The hairy bearded one\n\nPopularly known as \u2018Rayier\u2019 (hairy bearded one), Okero had a relatively successful political career between 1969 and 1979 as a Cabinet Minister and as a Member of Parliament for Gem Constituency in Nyanza Province. He had worked in various ministries under President Jomo Kenyatta (1969-1978) and briefly under President Daniel arap Moi.\n\nThroughout his 10 years as an MP he was on the front bench in Parliament as Minister for Health (1969-1973), Minister for Power and Communications (1973-1977) and in the same docket for his final term (1978-1979) under the Moi regime.\n\nOkero's principles, loyalty to Moi and impeccable legal and managerial track record paid dividends, leading to his appointment as Chairman of the Board of Kenya Airways for almost a decade, from 1996 to 2005, during its most turbulent years and successful privatisation programme. This was when the national airline had teamed up with the Royal Dutch Airlines (KLM) as a privatised entity and finally started to make profits. His legacy at KQ is that he was part of the team that midwifed the process, turning the loss-making carrier into a leading one in the region and across the African continent.\n\nIn a recent interview the former Minister, whose hobbies include flying and playing golf, preferred not to talk about the legacy he left as MP for Gem.\n\n\u201cLet others talk about my legacy. I don\u2019t talk about it because there is a tendency to praise oneself. That is natural. My approach is different. A legacy is history and it is for those who come after you to see and talk about it lest some say what you are saying is a lie.\u201d\n\nOkero recalled how he was appointed KANU National Chairman in 1978 during party national elections together with acting President Moi and Vice President Mwai Kibaki, who were the party President and Vice President respectively. The three received the same number of votes, thanks to the queue-voting system adopted by the thousands of delegates from the five provinces in the country at the time.\n\n\u201cDuring the visit to Kabarak (Moi\u2019s upcountry home), I insisted that I retain my post as chairman. I discussed it with Moi, and between Assistant Minister David Okiki Amayo and I, we agreed that we would go for that slot and nothing else on the basis that we, as a community, had a big stake in the leadership of the country,\u201d he said.\n\nLittle did he know that there was brewing opposition to his leadership by powerful forces in the KANU hierarchy at that crucial time in Kenya\u2019s history. The deal, it later transpired, must have been sealed long before D-Day. When the party elections finally came up, an expectant Okero and his supporters assembled at the Kenyatta International Conference Centre for the KANU National Delegates\u2019 Conference. They were, however, shocked to learn that delegates from Nyanza Province had met behind his back the previous night and decided to vote for Amayo.\n\nBut his principles would not allow him to be a sore loser. After the initial shock he stood up, strode confidently to the dais and took the microphone to make his feelings known.\n\n\u201cI am aware that a night meeting was held to support Okiki Amayo. Since I also come from Nyanza Province, I cannot oppose their decision. I wish Okiki the best,\u201d he declared before returning to his seat.\n\nWhen the next KANU elections were called, Okero was no longer a Minister as he had lost his Gem seat in the 1979 polls to Aggrey Otieno Ambala.\n\nJOHN HENRY OKWANYO: The anti-majimbo maverick\n\nJohn Henry Okwanyo became widely known early in his political career due to his sense of humour that he used to liven debates both within and outside Parliament. He became famous for his trademark refrain, \u201cWhat about Migori?\u201d which would become his nickname. He was zealous in his efforts to promote his constituency and his electorate at every opportunity during parliamentary debates.\n\nA story is told that one day in Parliament, Okwanyo dozed off as other MPs debated and presented problems facing their constituencies. When a colleague woke him up, Okwanyo is said to have shouted, \u201cAnd what about Migori?\u201d The joke stuck to him like glue. He later explained, \u201cI had taken an afternoon nap and when I woke up, I wanted to find out if they had discussed anything about Migori that I needed to know.\u201d\n\nOkwanyo counted his greatest moment in the Cabinet as hosting the week-long United Nations Energy Conference in Nairobi in 1981 while he was Minister for Energy. He was automatically appointed Conference President by virtue of being the hosting minister. The conference brought together senior Government officials, scientists and researchers from all over the world. After the conference, he was invited to New York to address another UN meeting.\n\nA Moi loyalist, Okwanyo never spared anyone who dared to criticise his mentor and boss. He was known by his supporters as a vehement opponent of \u2018Odingaism\u2019 \u2013 the Luo people\u2019s perceived obsession with Jaramogi Oginga Odinga, a man who commanded fanatical support from his community and across many parts of the country.\n\nIn 1990, a year before the landmark repeal of Section 2A of the Constitution, the Migori MP ran into trouble with his fellow Luo leaders \u2013 especially those in the Opposition and the Church \u2013 when he led a large delegation of elected MPs, KANU party officials and civic leaders to visit Moi at his Kabarak home in Nakuru District (now Nakuru County). During the visit that was well publicised by the Kenya Broadcasting Corporation, Okwanyo was in his element, showering praise on Moi while chastising other Luo leaders for embracing opposition politics.\n\nThe firebrand minister was quoted as saying, \u201cMtukufu Rais (Your Excellency) don\u2019t be misled; Luos still love you despite Jaramogi\u2019s opposition.\u201d Other leaders who were part of the delegation were Cabinet colleagues Charles Onyango Midika (MP for Nyando), Wilson Ndolo Ayah (Kisumu Rural) and Dalmas Otieno (Rongo). The agenda of the meeting was very clear: to denounce outspoken Anglican Church of Kenya Bishop Henry Okullu and Odinga for being a thorn in the flesh of the KANU government and for always campaigning for a multiparty system of governance.\n\nAs leader of the delegation, the Migori MP\u2019s fiery speech assured Moi that Nyanza leaders would not allow the likes of Odinga and the bishop to destabilise his government. The delegates did not walk away empty-handed; each was given KES 500 as a token of appreciation. They enthusiastically sang, \u201cJogoo (cockerel) juu! KANU yajenga nchi!\u201d (The cock was the party symbol and their words proclaimed that nation-building was assured in the hands of KANU.)\n\nOkwanyo also said during the live KBC coverage of the event, \u201cBishop Okullu and Jaramogi are the black sheep in the family. I am seeking permission from Your Excellency to deal with the duo!\u201d\n\nOkullu\u2019s bold rejoinder was well-publicised in a press conference. He said, \u201cOkwanyo should know that he is not a Luo community spokesman by any stretch of the imagination, and should therefore keep his mouth shut!\u201d\n\nA few months before he threw in the political towel, the former Minister called a press conference to bash the Luo community: \u201cThe KANU government has tried its best to help develop Nyanza, but the Luos are a difficult people who cannot be satisfied,\u201d he told journalists as he enumerated scores of projects that he praised the Government for implementing.", "articleBodyHtml": "<article>\n\n<figure><img src=\"https://cdn.standardmedia.co.ke/images/friday/elodgzut3vsv1d5f80677bd2dd9.jpg\">\n<figcaption><strong>Charles Njonjo, President Moi, GG Kariuki and Nicholas Biwott attend a church service in Mombasa in 1979.</strong> [Archives, Standard]</figcaption></figure>\n\n<p>Godfrey Gitahi Kariuki, more popularly known as G.G, was a close associate of President Daniel arap Moi.

His legacy at KQ is that he was part of the team that midwifed the process, turning the loss-making carrier into a leading one in the region and across the African continent.</p>\n\n<p>In a recent interview the former Minister, whose hobbies include flying and playing golf, preferred not to talk about the legacy he left as MP for Gem.</p>\n\n<p>\u201cLet others talk about my legacy. I don\u2019t talk about it because there is a tendency to praise oneself. That is natural. My approach is different. A legacy is history and it is for those who come after you to see and talk about it lest some say what you are saying is a lie.\u201d</p>\n\n<p>Okero recalled how he was appointed KANU National Chairman in 1978 during party national elections together with acting President Moi and Vice President Mwai Kibaki, who were the party President and Vice President respectively. The three received the same number of votes, thanks to the queue-voting system adopted by the thousands of delegates from the five provinces in the country at the time.</p>\n\n<p>\u201cDuring the visit to Kabarak (Moi\u2019s upcountry home), I insisted that I retain my post as chairman. I discussed it with Moi, and between Assistant Minister David Okiki Amayo and I, we agreed that we would go for that slot and nothing else on the basis that we, as a community, had a big stake in the leadership of the country,\u201d he said.</p>\n\n<p>Little did he know that there was brewing opposition to his leadership by powerful forces in the KANU hierarchy at that crucial time in Kenya\u2019s history. The deal, it later transpired, must have been sealed long before D-Day. When the party elections finally came up, an expectant Okero and his supporters assembled at the Kenyatta International Conference Centre for the KANU National Delegates\u2019 Conference. They were, however, shocked to learn that delegates from Nyanza Province had met behind his back the previous night and decided to vote for Amayo.</p>\n\n<p>But his principles would not allow him to be a sore loser. After the initial shock he stood up, strode confidently to the dais and took the microphone to make his feelings known.</p>\n\n<p>\u201cI am aware that a night meeting was held to support Okiki Amayo. Since I also come from Nyanza Province, I cannot oppose their decision. I wish Okiki the best,\u201d he declared before returning to his seat.</p>\n\n<p>When the next KANU elections were called, Okero was no longer a Minister as he had lost his Gem seat in the 1979 polls to Aggrey Otieno Ambala.</p>\n\n<figure><img src=\"https://cdn.standardmedia.co.ke/images/friday/arsztghyj74y2mhgdw5f8067380065d.jpg\">\n<figcaption><strong>John Okwanyo.</strong></figcaption></figure>\n\n<p><strong>JOHN HENRY OKWANYO: The anti-majimbo maverick</strong></p>\n\n<p>John Henry Okwanyo became widely known early in his political career due to his sense of humour that he used to liven debates both within and outside Parliament. He became famous for his trademark refrain, \u201cWhat about Migori?\u201d which would become his nickname. He was zealous in his efforts to promote his constituency and his electorate at every opportunity during parliamentary debates.</p>\n\n<p>A story is told that one day in Parliament, Okwanyo dozed off as other MPs debated and presented problems facing their constituencies. When a colleague woke him up, Okwanyo is said to have shouted, \u201cAnd what about Migori?\u201d The joke stuck to him like glue. He later explained, \u201cI had taken an afternoon nap and when I woke up, I wanted to find out if they had discussed anything about Migori that I needed to know.\u201d</p>\n\n<p>Okwanyo counted his greatest moment in the Cabinet as hosting the week-long United Nations Energy Conference in Nairobi in 1981 while he was Minister for Energy. He was automatically appointed Conference President by virtue of being the hosting minister. The conference brought together senior Government officials, scientists and researchers from all over the world. After the conference, he was invited to New York to address another UN meeting.</p>\n\n<p>A Moi loyalist, Okwanyo never spared anyone who dared to criticise his mentor and boss. He was known by his supporters as a vehement opponent of \u2018Odingaism\u2019 \u2013 the Luo people\u2019s perceived obsession with Jaramogi Oginga Odinga, a man who commanded fanatical support from his community and across many parts of the country.</p>\n\n<p>In 1990, a year before the landmark repeal of Section 2A of the Constitution, the Migori MP ran into trouble with his fellow Luo leaders \u2013 especially those in the Opposition and the Church \u2013 when he led a large delegation of elected MPs, KANU party officials and civic leaders to visit Moi at his Kabarak home in Nakuru District (now Nakuru County). During the visit that was well publicised by the Kenya Broadcasting Corporation, Okwanyo was in his element, showering praise on Moi while chastising other Luo leaders for embracing opposition politics.</p>\n\n<p>The firebrand minister was quoted as saying, \u201cMtukufu Rais (Your Excellency) don\u2019t be misled; Luos still love you despite Jaramogi\u2019s opposition.\u201d Other leaders who were part of the delegation were Cabinet colleagues Charles Onyango Midika (MP for Nyando), Wilson Ndolo Ayah (Kisumu Rural) and Dalmas Otieno (Rongo). The agenda of the meeting was very clear: to denounce outspoken Anglican Church of Kenya Bishop Henry Okullu and Odinga for being a thorn in the flesh of the KANU government and for always campaigning for a multiparty system of governance.</p>\n\n<p>As leader of the delegation, the Migori MP\u2019s fiery speech assured Moi that Nyanza leaders would not allow the likes of Odinga and the bishop to destabilise his government. The delegates did not walk away empty-handed; each was given KES 500 as a token of appreciation. They enthusiastically sang, \u201cJogoo (cockerel) juu! KANU yajenga nchi!\u201d (The cock was the party symbol and their words proclaimed that nation-building was assured in the hands of KANU.)</p>\n\n<p>Okwanyo also said during the live KBC coverage of the event, \u201cBishop Okullu and Jaramogi are the black sheep in the family. I am seeking permission from Your Excellency to deal with the duo!\u201d</p>\n\n<p>Okullu\u2019s bold rejoinder was well-publicised in a press conference. He said, \u201cOkwanyo should know that he is not a Luo community spokesman by any stretch of the imagination, and should therefore keep his mouth shut!\u201d</p>\n\n<p>A few months before he threw in the political towel, the former Minister called a press conference to bash the Luo community: \u201cThe KANU government has tried its best to help develop Nyanza, but the Luos are a difficult people who cannot be satisfied,\u201d he told journalists as he enumerated scores of projects that he praised the Government for implementing.</p>\n\n</article>", "canonicalUrl": "https://www.standardmedia.co.ke/moi-cabinets/article/2001389499/how-gg-kariuki-found-out-where-the-real-power-rested"},{"url": "https://www.standardmedia.co.ke/moi-cabinets/article/2001389505/isaac-ruto-the-rebel-with-or-without-cause", "probability": 0.9922999, "headline": "The minister Moi abandoned in South Africa", "datePublished": "2020-10-11T08:00:00+03:00", "datePublishedRaw": "Sun, 11 Oct 2020 08:00:00 EAT", "dateModified": "2020-10-11T08:00:00+03:00", "dateModifiedRaw": "Sun, 11 Oct 2020 08:00:00 EAT ", "author": "Standard Team", "authorsList": ["Standard Team"], "inLanguage": "en", "breadcrumbs": [{"name": "Home", "link": "https://www.standardmedia.co.ke"}, {"name": "Moi Cabinets", "link": "https://www.standardmedia.co.ke/category/571/moi-cabinets"}, {"name": "Isaac Ruto the rebel with or without cause", "link": "https://www.standardmedia.co.ke/moi-cabinets/article/2001389505/isaac-ruto-the-rebel-with-or-without-cause"}], "mainImage": "https://cdn.standardmedia.co.ke/images/friday/zgzsl9hkfgxcbglqt5f806f2cd257e.jpg", "images": ["https://cdn.standardmedia.co.ke/images/friday/zgzsl9hkfgxcbglqt5f806f2cd257e.jpg", "https://cdn.standardmedia.co.ke/images/friday/sdqbd16efolypkjsbe5f806fd08872c.jpg", "https://cdn.standardmedia.co.ke/images/friday/fabstohiruj9d9dw4mh5f806f71efa70.jpg"], "description": "Why Isaac Ruto was in and out of the Cabinet", "articleBody": "Isaac Kiprono Ruto was elected Chepalungu MP in 1997 to become one of President Daniel arap Moi\u2019s point men in South Rift Valley. Between 1998 and 1999, he was the Assistant Minister for Education, and later moved to the Ministry of Agriculture in the same capacity until 2001 when he became a Minister.\n\nAfter Bomet MP Kipkalya Kones was relieved of his duties for associating with the Opposition, Ruto was promoted to Minister for Vocational Training in 2002. As a politician and by his appointment, he was expected to ensure that the Opposition and the Kones influence came to nothing in the region that was traditionally a KANU stronghold.\n\nBefore the 2002 General Election, Ruto differed sharply with Moi shortly before the end of a two-day State tour of South Africa over the electability of Uhuru Kenyatta and Kipsigis community politics in general. The President abandoned him at a South African airport and Ruto had to return to Nairobi on a commercial airline. When asked why he was left behind, Ruto, who later patched up his differences with Moi, said it was a small difference not worth discussing with the media.\n\nThose who know the former Minister say he had a knack for differing with even those close to him. Ruto would differ with Moi, parliamentarians and even his Cabinet colleagues over issues he held close to his heart. His saving grace was that he did not hold grudges.\n\nKarugu\u2019s brief sojourn at the AG\u2019s chambers would be marked by three major events: A \u2018shoot to kill\u2019 order decreed by his predecessor Charles Njonjo, the Frank Sundstrom murder case and the Andrew Muthemba treason case.\n\nNjonjo, a man who had enjoyed immense power in his years as AG, left Karugu, one of his \u2018home boys\u2019 (both came from Kiambu District, and specifically Kabete), in a dilemma. Njonjo had just instructed the police to shoot violent robbers on sight, a directive that was vehemently opposed by some legislators who wanted to know how such an order would be carried out without trigger-happy police killing innocent Kenyans.\n\nInstead of clarifying the matter, Njonjo dropped it in Karugu\u2019s lap when he left office. But Karugu, a professional and ethical lawyer, neither rescinded nor endorsed the order. He instead issued a ministerial statement in Parliament cautioning against \u201cthe use of firearms by trigger-happy policemen\u201d. In the same statement, he defended the right of policemen to resort to the use of \u201csuch force as is necessary to apprehend a criminal or prevent the commission of crime\u201d.\n\nThis statement watered down Njonjo\u2019s \u2018shoot to kill\u2019 order and made Karugu the darling of MPs who had thought the order was outrageous.\n\nOn other front, American sailor Frank Joseph Sundstrom was arraigned following the brutal murder of an African girl named Monica Njeri in Mombasa in 1980. The case raised a hue and cry and drew a lot of publicity locally and abroad. Kenyans demanded justice for the girl and hoped for the American\u2019s execution, or at least a life sentence. On the other hand, \u2018Big Brother\u2019 (the United States government) exacted pressure on Kenya to release its citizen, the shocking murder notwithstanding.\n\nThe wheels of justice turned very fast for the American. One short month later, on 30 September 1980, Kenyans would be most dismayed when Justice Leslie Harris seemingly patted Sundstrom on the back by handing him the incredulous penalty of signing a bond promising to pay KES 500 \u201cif he failed to maintain good behaviour in the next two years\u201d. With those words from the honourable judge, the 19-year-old marine was free to go.\n\nMany Kenyans saw a white judge applauding his younger brother for skinning a black person. Among these was Attorney General James Karugu.\n\nIn those days, criticising the Judiciary or its officers, especially judges, was unheard of, but this did not stop Karugu. He censured Harris on this sentence that was an obvious perversion of justice. When the matter went to Parliament, MP Kimani wa Nyoike asked the AG whether he was satisfied that justice had been done or/and seen to have been done in the Sundstrom case. Karugu said he was not satisfied on both counts. Admitting that the matter had given him some anxious moments, the AG however added, \u201c\u2026 perhaps this is the price we have to pay for the independence of the Judiciary\u201d.\n\nProbed further, Karugu said, \u201cLet me assure the House \u2013 and I do this with all the sincerity I can command \u2013 that if I had any alternative, I would have appealed this case to a higher court.\u201d Unfortunately by that time, Parliament was yet to amend Section 379 of the Criminal Procedure Code which would have allowed the AG to appeal such a case in the Court of Appeal. \u201cI am legally impotent to do anything as far as this case is concerned,\u201d he said.\n\nIn those days the ruling party, KANU, was \u2018baba na mama\u2019 (father and mother, to mean all-powerful) and whatever its bigwigs said, however absurd, became law. So when reporters and editors of one local daily were picked up after the daily published a story suggesting that the author of a KANU press statement on an ongoing doctors\u2019 strike was anonymous, the State expected them to be duly charged. The newsmen spent the weekend in police cells but the police prosecutors were unable to craft a suitable charge.\n\nOn Monday, they turned to the AG for assistance, but Karugu told them he did not know of any law under which the journalists could be charged. This led to the release of the newsmen, who had been unlawfully held for more than 48 hours according to the Constitution. In the upper echelons of KANU, some people were very bitter with the AG as a result. These actions, perceived as defiance, sealed his fate as a marked man and after 15 months on the job, Karugu abruptly resigned.\n\nHENRY KIPRONO KOSGEY: Politician who headed no less than eight ministries\n\nThe reasons for Henry Kiprono Kosgey\u2019s elevation to the Cabinet were not difficult to see. He had indisputable academic credentials that set him apart from other politicians at that time.\n\nKosgey was first appointed Minister for Transport and Communications in 1979 and he held the position until 1985. He was in charge of the construction of numerous roads and other public works in the entire country. Also under him were Kenya Airways, Kenya Railways (KR) and Kenya Ports Authority, as well as the telecommunications sector. All the key State-owned companies, including the big employer, Kenya Posts and Telecommunications Corporation (KPTC), were undergoing modernisation. The ministry would later be caught up in accusations of extensive nepotism and corruption. In the eye of the storm were KPTC and KR.\n\nKosgey was moved to the Ministry of Cooperative Development following a Cabinet reshuffle in 1985. For two years, he was charged with improving and developing the cooperative movement in Kenya to benefit rural farmers, who were finding it difficult to market their produce. The Minister took over a system that was already operational, having been created during the colonial era and improved in the first two decades of independence. Somehow, the period from 1985 saw the sector suffer badly and today, only a few farmers\u2019 cooperatives are still on their feet.\n\nKosgey\u2019s management style and skills came under glaring scrutiny when he was moved to the Ministry of Culture and Social Services months before the All Africa Games were to be hosted in Nairobi in August 1987. The ministry was tasked with ensuring that this sports bonanza was a success. Indeed, the event was expected to rake in millions of shillings for the country. But somehow, the Minister got entangled in a multi-billion shilling scandal in which an advertising company associated with an American named Dick Berg swindled the Kenyan taxpayer before vanishing into thin air. Kosgey defended himself by saying Berg\u2019s contract was drawn up before he moved to the ministry.\n\nFollowing the 1992 elections, he served as a backbencher in Parliament for four years before he was appointed Minister for Environment and Natural Resources, and later Minister for Tourism and Wildlife. Things were not rosy for him in his new assignment. The heightened political tension associated with the agitation for multipartism led to a huge drop in tourist numbers. The international press relished depicting Kenya as a failed State that was insecure for visitors. Things would deteriorate further when, in 1998, the American Embassy in Nairobi was bombed in a terrorist attack that left 224 people dead. Kosgey had the difficult task of repairing Kenya\u2019s battered image.\n\nHe would soon be moved to the Ministry of Science and Technology, where he was between 1999 and 2001 before he was transferred again, this time to the Ministry of Education, at a time when teachers were demanding better working conditions and higher remuneration.\n\nThe tectonic forces that caused a major shift in Kenyan politics in December 2002 didn\u2019t spare Kosgey. However, he re-invented himself and became Chairman of the Orange Democratic Movement (ODM), an Opposition party, after decamping from KANU. He was rewarded with a Cabinet position and became Minister for Industrialisation after being elected as an MP in 2007.\n\nBut once again, Kosgey would be implicated in a case in which his ministry was reported to have imported 113 second-hand cars that were older than the mandatory eight years. He was forced to step aside in 2011 to pave the way for investigations. After a lengthy court case, he was found not guilty in June 2012 and President Mwai Kibaki reinstated him two months later.", "articleBodyHtml": "<article>\n\n<figure><img src=\"https://cdn.standardmedia.co.ke/images/friday/zgzsl9hkfgxcbglqt5f806f2cd257e.jpg\">\n<figcaption><strong>Abandoned in South Africa, Isaac Ruto. </strong>[File, Standard]</figcaption></figure>\n\n<p>Isaac Kiprono Ruto was elected Chepalungu MP in 1997 to become one of President Daniel arap Moi\u2019s point men in South Rift Valley.

He put his tribe\u2019s interests ahead of everything else. He was an ultra-conservative and stubborn stickler for adhering to traditions perceived to be repugnant in a modern Kenya. For example, he believed that cattle rustling (outlawed in Kenya) was part of the Pokot culture, and he was ready to be jailed for his opinions.\n\nHis rigid traditional opinions often antagonised other Kenyan communities. In 1993, he went on record as having given members of the Kikuyu community an ultimatum to leave Pokot District or face eviction by the locals, accusing them of denying the Pokot their livelihood. He targeted the same community before the 1997 General Election. He reportedly instructed those who had settled in West Pokot to \u201cgo and vote where they were born\u201d. Several independent human rights bodies, including the Institute for Education in Democracy, the Catholic Justice and Peace Commission and the National Council of Churches of Kenya, cited this as an election malpractice.\n\nThis behaviour not only cost him a Cabinet post but also landed him in jail. He, however, changed his stand in 1998 after Moi placed him at the forefront of brokering peace between the Pokot and the neighbouring communities comprising the Turkana, Samburu and Marakwet.\n\nAs Minister for Environment and Natural Resources, Lotodo defended the illegal allotment of Karura Forest in Nairobi. He also defended his contradictory position, saying that unlike the Kaya Mwache Forest, which lies at the Coast, Karura was situated in a multi-ethnic area. Nobody, he said, \u201cshouted\u201d when Karura was dished out.\n\nWhen the issue was discussed in Parliament in 1998 and MPs insisted that he degazette the Karura allocations, Lotodo stated that \u201cwhen it comes to degazetting Karura Forest, maybe another minister will do that. I will not revoke any allotment come what may!\u201d\n\nIn 2011, some 11 years after his death, the Daily Nation published an article saying, \u201cThe Pokot hold him in awe even in death \u2014 and those who saw his style of fiery and fearless leadership describe Francis Lotodo as a man who gave his all for the people he led.\u201d\n\nThe humble three-bedroom rural abode of newly-appointed Minister for Sports and Culture, Francis Mwanzia Nyenze, became home for a night for President Daniel arap Moi during a two-day tour of Kitui District in the days when mere proximity to the President was a ticket to power.\n\nNyenze, then in his late 30s and serving his first term as Member of Parliament for Kitui West Constituency, was rendered speechless when Moi called to inform him that he planned to tour Kitui to meet with KANU party branch leaders, inspect Government projects and hold public rallies in Kitui and Mwingi, and that after the first leg of his tour he would spend the night at Nyenze\u2019s home in Kyondoni Village.\n\nNyenze, who had just been transferred from the Ministry of Environment to Sports and Culture in an earlier Cabinet reshuffle, drove to State House in a panic that same afternoon to beseech President Moi to consider spending the night elsewhere because he did not have a good enough house to host him. As related by Nyenze\u2019s wife Edith, who was then the principal of Kyondoni Girls\u2019 Secondary School in Kitui, Moi responded that he had no intention of changing his plans and that he was perfectly happy to sleep in Nyenze\u2019s rural home no matter what state it was in.\n\nHappily, according to the Sunday Nation of 17 December 2017 headlined \u2018When Moi Spent the Night at Nyenze\u2019s Three-Bedroomed House\u2019, a team of top Government officers from both State House and Office of the President was sent off to refurbish the residence, an exercise that involved a fresh coat of paint, new furniture, new cutlery and even a telephone hotline to ensure the President was accommodated in accordance with his status.\n\nThere was speculation as to why the President had chosen the humble home of a fairly junior politician at a time when Kitui had many senior leaders, including Kalonzo Musyoka, George Ndotto and Nyiva Mwendwa, all of whom had magnificent residences compared to Nyenze\u2019s modest dwelling. Political pundits saw the visit as a demonstration of Moi\u2019s penchant for playing politicians against each other in order to destabilise them and keep them guessing.\n\nDuring his time at the helm of the Ministry of Environment, Nyenze, who was charismatic, easy-going and jocular, was credited with strengthening the capacity of the National Environment Management Agency to effectively play its crucial role of assessing the environmental impact of development initiatives across the country. He frequently spearheaded ministerial initiatives to plant more trees and protect riparian land.\n\nWhen he was transferred to the Ministry of Heritage and Sports in the politically charged year of 2001, Nyenze initiated policy to strengthen the capacity of the ministry to protect heritage sites in the country. Additional heritage sites were roped in for special protection by the Government. He also took significant measures to promote athletics and football in the country.\n\nFRANCIS YEKOYODA OMOTO MASAKHALIA: Seventh Finance minister\n\nFrancis Yekoyada Omoto Masakhalia, Kenya\u2019s seventh Minister for Finance, went down in history as Kenya\u2019s shortest-serving minister in this role under President Daniel arap Moi. He served only six months, starting his tenure on 27 February 1999 after working as Minister for Industrial Development and leaving in August of the same year.\n\nDuring his short time at the National Treasury Masakhalia capped the engine size of cars driven by Cabinet ministers and permanent secretaries at no more than 1,800 cc. Large Mercedes Benz vehicles were parked at the Foreign Office, ostensibly to be used by visiting foreign dignitaries, while others were parked in Nairobi\u2019s Industrial Area to be offered for sale through public tender.\n\nBut he was just implementing what his predecessor, Simeon Nyachae, had proposed in an earlier budget reading. However, Nyachae\u2019s attempts to seize the big vehicles had floundered as politicians fought the initiative.\n\nMasakhalia was a technocrat par excellence; a career civil servant who had risen steadily through the ranks of the civil service. With a doctorate in economic development, founding President Jomo Kenyatta had appointed him the first Chief Economist in the Ministry of Finance and Planning on 17 May 1972. He would be appointed Permanent Secretary in the Ministry of Economic Planning in 1980 under Moi.\n\nDespite his experience and knowledge of matters finance, Masakhalia's stewardship at the National Treasury did not reverse the downward trend of Kenya\u2019s economy. The shilling plunged from KES 62 to KES 74 per dollar, bank interest rates soared from 7 to 15 per cent and the Government defaulted on a USD 52 million (KES 4 billion at the time) foreign debt.\n\nThe default on foreign debt was later explained as \u201cadministrative delays at the Treasury\u201d, a situation that could have been averted if the Minister had been a meticulous administrator. It was not surprising, therefore, that Masakhalia learned of his transfer to the Ministry of Energy via the (in)famous Kenya Broadcasting Corporation one o\u2019clock news bulletin from his personal assistant.\n\nAs he packed his belongings, he told journalists that the Energy portfolio was equally challenging as it had a bearing on economic recovery.\n\n\u201cThe six-month stint was not adequate for me to put in place economic policies, strategies and measures to get things moving,\u201d he was quoted saying by the media.\n\nGEORGE KAMAU MUHOHO: Inspired by the desire to serve the people\n\nGeorge Kamau Muhoho, a one-time priest who rose through the ranks of the Catholic Church administration to serve as Private Secretary to Pope Paul IV, left it all behind to enter local politics and serve his country\u2019s people instead.\n\nHe was ordained as a Catholic priest in 1963, the year Kenya attained independence, and served the Church in various administrative capacities. In addition to his service to the Pope, he was the first black African Papal Envoy to Brussels, Luxembourg, the Council of Europe and NATO. He was then appointed as the Pope\u2019s emissary to Uganda during the reign of Idi Amin in 1972.\n\nHe speaks Latin, Spanish, Italian, French and German, in addition to multiple African languages. He thereafter served as Chaplain of the University of Nairobi in 1976. After 13 years in the Catholic Church, Muhoho quit his priestly duties and calling.\n\n\u201cI decided my life was not in the priesthood,\u201d he was quoted saying in a 2004 news report. \u201cI had always wanted to serve the Church at the parish level\u2026 when I joined the administration, I felt I wasn\u2019t serving the people the way I wanted. It was not an easy decision. I had done a lot of soul-searching (and) took a week off to pray alone in my house,\u201d he added.\n\nIn 1983, the priest entered politics and won the Juja Constituency seat. President Daniel arap Moi appointed him Assistant Minister for Education, later elevating him to Minister for Tourism and Wildlife in 1987. His political career was succeeded by a stint in the parastatal sector as Director-General of the Kenya Airports Authority during President Mwai Kibaki\u2019s tenure.", "articleBodyHtml": "<article>\n\n<figure><img src=\"https://cdn.standardmedia.co.ke/images/thursday/mvepyzqjkv5lkf5f7f2926b05ce.jpg\">\n<figcaption><strong>Francis Lotodo didn't mince his words.</strong> [Archives, Standard]</figcaption></figure>\n\n<p>Francis Loile Polis Lotodo was one of a kind.

Large Mercedes Benz vehicles were parked at the Foreign Office, ostensibly to be used by visiting foreign dignitaries, while others were parked in Nairobi\u2019s Industrial Area to be offered for sale through public tender.</p>\n\n<p>But he was just implementing what his predecessor, Simeon Nyachae, had proposed in an earlier budget reading. However, Nyachae\u2019s attempts to seize the big vehicles had floundered as politicians fought the initiative.</p>\n\n<p>Masakhalia was a technocrat par excellence; a career civil servant who had risen steadily through the ranks of the civil service. With a doctorate in economic development, founding President Jomo Kenyatta had appointed him the first Chief Economist in the Ministry of Finance and Planning on 17 May 1972. He would be appointed Permanent Secretary in the Ministry of Economic Planning in 1980 under Moi.</p>\n\n<p>Despite his experience and knowledge of matters finance, Masakhalia's stewardship at the National Treasury did not reverse the downward trend of Kenya\u2019s economy. The shilling plunged from KES 62 to KES 74 per dollar, bank interest rates soared from 7 to 15 per cent and the Government defaulted on a USD 52 million (KES 4 billion at the time) foreign debt.</p>\n\n<p>The default on foreign debt was later explained as \u201cadministrative delays at the Treasury\u201d, a situation that could have been averted if the Minister had been a meticulous administrator. It was not surprising, therefore, that Masakhalia learned of his transfer to the Ministry of Energy via the (in)famous Kenya Broadcasting Corporation one o\u2019clock news bulletin from his personal assistant.</p>\n\n<p>As he packed his belongings, he told journalists that the Energy portfolio was equally challenging as it had a bearing on economic recovery.</p>\n\n<p>\u201cThe six-month stint was not adequate for me to put in place economic policies, strategies and measures to get things moving,\u201d he was quoted saying by the media.</p>\n\n<figure><img src=\"https://cdn.standardmedia.co.ke/images/thursday/etajwe0elkxivw0gp5f7f2c2cafb6c.jpg\"></figure>\n\n<p><strong>GEORGE KAMAU MUHOHO: Inspired by the desire to serve the people</strong></p>\n\n<p>George Kamau Muhoho, a one-time priest who rose through the ranks of the Catholic Church administration to serve as Private Secretary to Pope Paul IV, left it all behind to enter local politics and serve his country\u2019s people instead.</p>\n\n<p>He was ordained as a Catholic priest in 1963, the year Kenya attained independence, and served the Church in various administrative capacities. In addition to his service to the Pope, he was the first black African Papal Envoy to Brussels, Luxembourg, the Council of Europe and NATO. He was then appointed as the Pope\u2019s emissary to Uganda during the reign of Idi Amin in 1972.</p>\n\n<p>He speaks Latin, Spanish, Italian, French and German, in addition to multiple African languages. He thereafter served as Chaplain of the University of Nairobi in 1976. After 13 years in the Catholic Church, Muhoho quit his priestly duties and calling.</p>\n\n<p>\u201cI decided my life was not in the priesthood,\u201d he was quoted saying in a 2004 news report. \u201cI had always wanted to serve the Church at the parish level\u2026 when I joined the administration, I felt I wasn\u2019t serving the people the way I wanted. It was not an easy decision. I had done a lot of soul-searching (and) took a week off to pray alone in my house,\u201d he added.</p>\n\n<p>In 1983, the priest entered politics and won the Juja Constituency seat. President Daniel arap Moi appointed him Assistant Minister for Education, later elevating him to Minister for Tourism and Wildlife in 1987. His political career was succeeded by a stint in the parastatal sector as Director-General of the Kenya Airports Authority during President Mwai Kibaki\u2019s tenure.</p>\n\n</article>", "canonicalUrl": "https://www.standardmedia.co.ke/moi-cabinets/article/2001389377/francis-lotodo-the-fierce-community-defender"},{"url": "https://www.standardmedia.co.ke/moi-cabinets/article/2001389374/robert-ouko-kenyas-most-celebrated-foreign-affairs-minister", "probability": 0.9912662, "headline": "Robert Ouko: Kenya\u2019s most celebrated Foreign Affairs minister", "datePublished": "2020-10-09T06:00:00+03:00", "datePublishedRaw": "Fri, 09 Oct 2020 06:00:00 EAT", "dateModified": "2020-10-09T06:00:00+03:00", "dateModifiedRaw": "Fri, 09 Oct 2020 06:00:00 EAT ", "author": "Standard Team", "authorsList": ["Standard Team"], "inLanguage": "en", "breadcrumbs": [{"name": "Home", "link": "https://www.standardmedia.co.ke"}, {"name": "Moi Cabinets", "link": "https://www.standardmedia.co.ke/category/571/moi-cabinets"}, {"name": "Robert Ouko: Kenya\u2019s most celebrated Foreign Affairs minister", "link": "https://www.standardmedia.co.ke/moi-cabinets/article/2001389374/robert-ouko-kenyas-most-celebrated-foreign-affairs-minister"}], "mainImage": "https://cdn.standardmedia.co.ke/images/thursday/iboktw2mte8gpkdm5f7f247ec1867.jpg", "images": ["https://cdn.standardmedia.co.ke/images/thursday/iboktw2mte8gpkdm5f7f247ec1867.jpg", "https://cdn.standardmedia.co.ke/images/thursday/mvsel7rqp9vsjmdc5f7f253f4fed1.jpg", "https://cdn.standardmedia.co.ke/images/thursday/zqjlgbmhwdml5zcb5f7f258938498.jpg"], "description": "Robert Ouko defended Kenya's image from his heart", "articleBody": "Dr Robert John Ouko had an impeccable record in the Ministry of Foreign Affairs under President Daniel arap Moi for six years, between 1979 and 1983, and again from 1988 to 1990, during one of the country\u2019s most turbulent times. The KANU party\u2019s regime was under pressure locally and internationally over its appalling human rights record and grand corruption. The pressure was intensified and spearheaded locally by the Clergy and by an outlawed group called Mwakenya that was made up of university students, politicians and activists.\n\nDespite the onslaught from Opposition leaders, Western envoys accredited to Kenya, and development partners like the International Monetary Fund (IMF) and the World Bank, the Kisumu Town MP strongly defended the Moi regime through local and international media platforms. Indeed, Ouko emerged as one of the foremost articulate defenders of the track record of Moi\u2019s political establishment, especially in view of adverse coverage in the country and in the Western press.\n\nThe Minister was eloquent, brilliant and unflinching in his speech and defence of his motherland at a press conference in Oslo, Sweden, in the 1980s. Analysts applauded him for the manner in which he handled the gruelling one-hour forum, during which he fielded myriad hostile questions on many topics. He gave a sterling performance and emerged as the perfect spokesman for his country. Another demonstration of his brilliance was observed when he held another well-attended press conference in Washington, DC, in January 1990 when Moi visited the United States. Ouko was reported by the international media to have \u201cout-thought and out-shone a hitherto hostile American Press, as the top-most diplomat and Moi\u2019s blued-eyed boy\u201d.\n\nMoi is on record describing Ouko as \u201ca true friend and confidant\u201d. The President also denied claims that his government had played any role in Ouko\u2019s murder in February 1990. Several books have been published about the murder, which stands unsolved to date.\n\nDR BONAYA ADHI GODANA: The gem from Marsabit\n\nDr Bonaya Adhi Godana came from a very poor background and how he managed to beat all odds to become a legislator left many puzzled. His Gabra community was barely known beyond Marsabit District (now known as Marsabit County). The former herdsboy\u2019s struggle to go to school and eventually become a distinguished lawyer before ending up as a people\u2019s representative won him the admiration of many.\n\nGodana\u2019s appointment marked the first time since independence that a Member of Parliament from Marsabit had been made a Cabinet Minister. The country was keenly watching the young MP who had been assigned the Foreign Affairs docket, especially because of his brilliant contributions in Parliament.\n\nAt the time of his appointment, the relationship between Kenya and Ethiopia, countries that had traditionally been allies in the Horn of Africa, had begun to deteriorate following claims of the presence of members of the Oromo Liberation Front (OLF) in Kenyan territory. The Kenya Government found itself in a delicate situation \u2013 both the Gabra and Borana communities who occupy Moyale and other parts of Marsabit are Oromo speakers. As such, they share names and have even intermarried over the years. These intercultural relations made it difficult to differentiate between Kenyans and Ethiopians. In violent encounters with Kenyan security forces, there would often be casualties, which provoked anger from local leaders, especially politicians, who denounced such incidents as they blamed the Government for failing to protect its own citizens. The porous border was also a transit point for smuggling small arms and light weapons.\n\nTo calm this situation, President Daniel arap Moi chose Godana as an indigenous member of Marsabit and a distinguished lawyer with a PhD in international law as he was conversant with the politics of the Horn of Africa.\n\nGodana was first elected to Parliament in 1988 to represent the newly-created North Horr Constituency, which was carved out of Marsabit North during a review of constituency boundaries in 1986. With his knowledge of law, the sharp-witted MP was quick to study parliamentary rules and procedures in his first stint in Parliament, and he stood out as a knowledgeable debater.\n\nAs a renowned lawmaker and diplomat, Godana continued to work to establish peace between the two communities even after Moi retired.\n\nELIJAH WASIKE MWANGALE: The minister who escorted a fleeing Obote to State House\n\nThe events leading to Elijah Wasike Mwangale becoming known as \u2018Chairman\u2019 were tragic, and involved the grisly death of former Nyandarua North MP Josiah Mwangi Kariuki (popularly known as J.M.), whose body was found by a Maasai herdsman in the Ngong Hills near Nairobi on 2 March 1975. Mwangale, then a flamboyant, bearded and fiery MP for Bungoma East Constituency, chaired the 11-member committee that investigated the mysterious death.\n\nAccording to Moi Cabinets from which this excerpt comes, Mwangale took over the Foreign Affairs docket in a time of regional and international crises. There was political turmoil in Uganda, with coups and counter-coups keeping the country in a state of tension. Tanzanians were grappling with a smooth transition from the founding President, Julius Nyerere, to Ali Hassan Mwinyi. There were coups in Rwanda and Burundi. And an arduous Iran-Iraq war had affected oil prices worldwide.\n\nHis most difficult assignment was Uganda, which had had no peace since February 1971 when Idi Amin, a military officer, toppled Milton Obote\u2019s first government. Obote\u2019s fledgeling second government was on its knees in 1985, when Government forces tired of fighting the National Resistance Movement rebels led by Yoweri Museveni.\n\nGeneral Tito Okello staged a coup then went public to say it was \u201cnot a coup, but an uncoordinated movement of troops\u201d in Kampala. This was to facilitate Obote\u2019s safe passage through the Busia District border into Kenya\u2019s State Lodge in Kakamega District. It was Mwangale that Moi sent to Kakamega to escort Obote to State House Nakuru. Later, the Minister would publicly confess that he did not know whether to address Obote as \u201cYour Excellency former President\u201d or simply \u201cDr Obote.\u201d\n\nMwangale was moved to the Ministry of Agriculture after he discredited the 1988 General Election, leaving Foreign Affairs to Robert Ouko.

Opposition MPs, who described him as an anti-corruption crusader, urged the World Bank and International Monetary Fund, who were at the time withholding funds to Kenya citing runaway graft and poor governance, to continue doing so when Kiptoon was eventually sacked. Some said he had invited his sacking by clinging to the \u2018Mr Clean\u2019 tag in the midst of looters. He left the Cabinet without any scandals attached to his name.</p>\n\n<p>As the Minister for Roads, Kiptoon was said to be conversant with the state of all roads in the country and regretted that he was sacked before he fixed the ones in his constituency. He was one of the people who suggested that the six million-year-old skeleton discovered in Baringo North Constituency be given the name Arrorin Tugenensis. The former minister came from the Arror sub-tribe of the Tugen community, hence the name he proposed for the fossil find.</p>\n\n</article>", "canonicalUrl": "https://www.standardmedia.co.ke/moi-cabinets/article/2001389239/from-dissident-to-cabinet-minister"},{"url": "https://www.standardmedia.co.ke/health/article/2001431665/organic-red-wine-and-other-eco-friendly-gift-ideas", "probability": 0.98208594, "headline": "Organic red wine and other eco-friendly gift ideas", "datePublished": "2021-12-13T00:00:00+03:00", "datePublishedRaw": "Mon,Dec 13 2021 00:00:00 EAT", "dateModified": "2021-12-13T00:00:00+03:00", "dateModifiedRaw": "Mon,Dec 13 2021 00:00:00 EAT", "author": "NANCY NZAU | Mon,Dec 13 2021 00:00:00 EAT", "authorsList": ["NANCY NZAU | Mon", "Dec 13 2021 00:00:00 EAT"], "inLanguage": "en", "mainImage": "https://cdn.standardmedia.co.ke/images/sunday/zehinpmpcfovot9dets61b5fed08afa0.jpg", "images": ["https://cdn.standardmedia.co.ke/images/sunday/zehinpmpcfovot9dets61b5fed08afa0.jpg"], "description": "Organic wines are made from grapes grown without pesticides, additives or synthetic fertilizers.", "articleBody": "Reduce, reuse, recycle but don\u2019t to re-gift.

However, Saitoti himself was at one time accused of complicity in these clashes by Human Rights Watch, a non-government organisation.\n\nFrom 1991 to 1993, a series of financial scandals implicating senior Government officials rocked the country and resulted in the suspension of donor aid. The most infamous of these, in which Saitoti was implicated, was the Goldenberg scam. Goldenberg involved millions of dollars in fake gold exports paid to Goldenberg International. In 1999 Raila Odinga, an Opposition politician, sued the VP and others for their alleged involvement in the scandal. Otieno Kajwang\u2019, the MP for Mbita and an ally of Odinga, moved a private member\u2019s motion in Parliament seeking a no-confidence declaration against the VP on account of his alleged role in Goldenberg.\n\nSaitoti fought gallantly to clear his name in Parliament and in the courts, but although he won these battles, the political stench of the scandal would never be too far from him. On 3 February 2006, a report by the Judicial Commission of Inquiry into the Goldenberg Affair chaired by Justice Samuel Bosire recommended that Saitoti should face criminal charges for his involvement in the scandal. Ten days later, the VP voluntarily stepped down from his ministerial position to make way for investigations into the allegations. On 31 July 2006, a three-judge bench headed by Justice Joseph Nyamu issued an order that would clear Saitoti of any wrongdoing, expunge his name from the commission\u2019s report and put in place a permanent stay of prosecution against him.\n\nWhen the report by the committee investigating Minister for Foreign Affairs Robert Ouko\u2019s death was being debated, an angry Saitoti queried: \u201cHow come the committee never deemed it fit to investigate why the Vice President was almost dying at the same time? At the time Ouko was killed, I had been poisoned. I was unconscious. Saitoti was on his deathbed. This is not my original skin,\u201d he raged, while displaying his hands.\n\nAt a KANU National Delegates Conference in Kasarani in 2002, the party changed its constitution to allow for a merger with Raila Odinga\u2019s National Development Party, and created four new Vice Chairman positions. This effectively watered down Saitoti\u2019s position and, consequently, his chances of succeeding Moi. Following his vocal complaint to the President that his name was missing from the leaders\u2019 line-up, Moi told him to his face that he was not \u201cpresidential material\u201d. In response to the snub, Saitoti famously told the conference, \u201cThere comes a time when the nation is much more important than an individual.\u201d\n\nThe height of his humiliation came during a meeting in his own constituency, where Moi explained his reasons for overlooking the VP in his succession plans. Speaking in Kiswahili, the President said: \u201cHuyu makamu wa rais ni rafiki yangu. Lakini urafiki na siasa ni tofauti\u2026\u201d (The Vice President is my friend. But politics and friendship are two different things.)\n\nLater, on arrival from an official trip to America, Saitoti expressed his intention to vie for the presidency on a KANU ticket despite Moi\u2019s endorsement of Uhuru Kenyatta.\n\n\u201cMy service to this country has prepared me to handle the challenges of leadership. It is therefore only proper that I respond affirmatively to calls from the Kenyan people that I should offer myself for nomination,\u201d the VP told reporters at the Jomo Kenyatta International Airport in Nairobi.\n\nThis announcement led to his sacking in August 2002 for \u201cspearheading a mutiny in the Cabinet\u201d. Saitoti responded by accusing Moi of undermining democracy. \u201cKenyans have come to value democracy,\u201d he told The Telegraph newspaper, and further asserted, \u201cWe should be strengthening democracy, not eroding it.\u201d\n\nDARIUS MBELA: Singing minister who declared war on slums\n\nApart from politics, Darius Mbela made a mark as a choral composer, singer and conductor. He was \u201cthe only old boy who had sung his way into Parliament\u201d, Mbela\u2019s fellow Alliance High School alumnus, Attorney General Amos Wako, once said of him. Accompanied by the St Stephen\u2019s Church Choir, he was reportedly involved in the composition of the dirges that were sung during founding President Jomo Kenyatta\u2019s funeral in 1978. He was at the time a Permanent Secretary.\n\nBut what singularly defines Mbela\u2019s role in national politics was his tenure at the Ministry of Lands and Housing where, despite his best efforts, he was not able to address Kenya\u2019s squatter problem, especially in Coast Province. It was during his tenure that land grabbers ruthlessly targeted public utilities.\n\nAmong his first assignments at Lands and Housing was opening a key conference that focused on unplanned settlements. At this meeting he said the greatest challenge in Nairobi was to work out viable strategies for adequate shelter for the city\u2019s residents, according to the news magazine The Weekly Review, of December 1988. The Government, he stated, would discourage rural-urban migration by decentralising the country\u2019s urban structure. Experts were predicting the population of Nairobi would hit the 5 million mark in 2000.\n\nIn July 1988 he appointed a team \u2013 drawing officials from the Nairobi City Commission; the ministries of Housing, Local Government and Physical Planning; and the provincial administration \u2013 to improve housing in Nairobi, especially in the unplanned settlements.\n\n\u201cMany of the city dwellers are living in squalid conditions which have in turn created a host of other problems such as violent crimes, prostitution, illicit brewing of alcohol, drug abuse and begging,\u201d he said as he announced the creation of the committee. \u201cNo government can feel proud when its people are living in a temporary shelter made of cardboard and plastic materials.\u201d\n\nThree months later, he proposed that all housing projects in urban areas must be multi-storey because such buildings offered the best use of land, making them the most suitable for densely populated urban areas.\n\n\u201cFrom now henceforth, high-rise housing development will be the rule rather than the exception,\u201d he declared as he launched a KES 179 million Kibera high-rise scheme for the National Housing Corporation (NHC).\n\nIn May 1989 the Daily Nation reported, \u201cOpen stinking sewers, narrow filthy earth roads and wretched timber and mud-walled dilapidated buildings with rusty corrugated iron-sheet roofs which characterise slums everywhere in the world will be an endangered species in Kenya by the turn of this century.\u201d\n\nMbela had just declared war on slums. \u201cIt is a Government policy that no slum should see the year 2000.\u201d This announcement followed a Presidential directive in 1987 that had ordered NHC to plan to wipe out all slums in Nairobi, Mombasa, Kisumu and Nakuru, and all other major towns. This started with high-rise buildings in Pumwani and Kibera.\n\nHis other task as minister was to resettle the landless. Whereas this was a noble idea, it emerged later that the land was issued out to senior military officers and public servants, top politicians and politically-connected individuals, and not the intended squatters. It was thus not surprising that in 1988, Mbooni MP Johnstone Makau claimed that the Ministry of Lands and Housing was full of corruption, inefficiency and chaos.\n\nDANIEL MUSYOKA MUTINDA: Lawyer who opposed anti-Moi campaigners\n\nWhen Daniel Musyoka Mutinda was appointed to head the Ministry of Information and Broadcasting, it was a relatively small docket presiding over only the Kenya News Agency and the Voice of Kenya (VoK). He concentrated his efforts on improving broadcast services to reach more Kenyans through the installation of more short-wave and VHF radio transmitters in Langata, Kisumu, Meru, Nyeri, Nakuru, Limuru and Timboroa.\n\nThe Minister said in 1977 there were only 1.5 million radio sets in Kenya with about 5 million listeners, and just 50,000 television sets and about 350,000 viewers in urban areas. The installation of radio transmitters enabled more Kenyans to access VoK services. At that time, private television and FM radio stations did not exist.\n\nMutinda is also credited with developing and promoting local radio and television programme material, and sourcing suitable programming from the West, especially from the United States and Europe. On numerous occasions he called for cooperation between African television organisations for drama, music and other cultural programmes. This quest led to the establishment of the Union of National Radio and Television Organisations of Africa (URTNA) which, at the invitation of Kenya, set up a Television Programme Exchange Centre at Kenyatta International Conference Centre in Nairobi. Through it, African television organisations exchanged programmes that enriched overall content.\n\nMutinda also boosted the film industry through the Kenya Institute of Mass Communications and the ministry\u2019s Film Department. But this effort did not go very far, because the UNESCO-funded exchange programme ended after funding dried up due to a general lack of interest from many participating countries.", "articleBodyHtml": "<article>\n\n<figure><img src=\"https://cdn.standardmedia.co.ke/images/friday/jircxsx9xurmlqv5f8018b029e77.jpg\"></figure>\n\n<p>There were two celebrated professors in President Daniel arap Moi\u2019s administration: Moi, the self-proclaimed \u201cProfessor of Politics\u201d, and his long-serving Vice President, George Muthengi Saitoti, Professor of Mathematics.</p>\n\n<p>Moi would nominate Saitoti to the National Assembly in October 1983, signalling the beginning of sweeping changes in the hierarchy of the ruling party, KANU, and the Government.</p>\n\n<p>To his credit, Saitoti made major developmental strides in Kajiado North, a constituency that accommodates people from many Kenyan communities and that was by 2009 ranked one of the richest constituencies in the country.

The three months turned into a long and nightmarish prison detention when it overlapped with that of the other members of the \u2018Kapenguria Six\u2019, who were rounded up and detained at the Kapenguria detention camp following the declaration of the State of Emergency.\n\nThis daredevil character was honed in prison where Ngei, the youngest and most educated of the prisoners, often came to fellow detainee Jomo Kenyatta\u2019s aid whenever other prisoners threatened to beat him up. Kenyatta\u2019s relationship with Ngei blossomed even more when he stopped a colonial jailer from caning the old man and instead offered himself for the caning. Little wonder that when they were all released nine years later, in 1961, the two developed a strong personal and political bond that made them almost inseparable. Both carried fly whisks and wore matching black leather jackets.\n\nNgei was not called \u201cBwana Mashamba\u201d (Mr Farmlands) for nothing. During the pre-independence political rallies held by the Kapenguria Six and others following their release, Ngei specifically spoke about the need for Africans, who were deprived of their mashamba (land) to wrest them back from the white colonial grabbers and return them to their rightful owners.\n\nAt one such rally in Ruring\u2019u Stadium, Nyeri District, when Ngei was given an opportunity to pray at the end of the event, he beseeched \u201cthe God of Africans to urge the God of Whites to leave to Kenyans the land they occupy and go back in Britain in peace\u201d. For this, Ngei was charged with incitement and charged KES 500.

The three months turned into a long and nightmarish prison detention when it overlapped with that of the other members of the \u2018Kapenguria Six\u2019, who were rounded up and detained at the Kapenguria detention camp following the declaration of the State of Emergency.</p>\n\n<p>This daredevil character was honed in prison where Ngei, the youngest and most educated of the prisoners, often came to fellow detainee Jomo Kenyatta\u2019s aid whenever other prisoners threatened to beat him up. Kenyatta\u2019s relationship with Ngei blossomed even more when he stopped a colonial jailer from caning the old man and instead offered himself for the caning. Little wonder that when they were all released nine years later, in 1961, the two developed a strong personal and political bond that made them almost inseparable. Both carried fly whisks and wore matching black leather jackets.</p>\n\n<p>Ngei was not called \u201cBwana Mashamba\u201d (Mr Farmlands) for nothing. During the pre-independence political rallies held by the Kapenguria Six and others following their release, Ngei specifically spoke about the need for Africans, who were deprived of their mashamba (land) to wrest them back from the white colonial grabbers and return them to their rightful owners.</p>\n\n<p>At one such rally in Ruring\u2019u Stadium, Nyeri District, when Ngei was given an opportunity to pray at the end of the event, he beseeched \u201cthe God of Africans to urge the God of Whites to leave to Kenyans the land they occupy and go back in Britain in peace\u201d. For this, Ngei was charged with incitement and charged KES 500. Enthusiastic crowds quickly raised the money, harambee style, and stuffed the currency notes in his pockets while carrying him shoulder high.</p>\n\n<p>When Daniel arap Moi took over as President, he appointed Ngei Minister for Lands and he busied himself with solving the many land problems bedevilling the country.

On the fateful day, at around 9pm, I was waylaid by four men who held me down and raped me in turns. Unfortunately, I didn\u2019t recognise any of them. No suspect was ever arrested,\u201d said Wairimu.\n\nFollowing the harrowing ordeal, Belinda said she sought treatment only to later realise that she had fallen pregnant.\n\n\u201cTerminating the pregnancy was not among my options. I decided to keep the child though I knew this would be a constant reminder of the painful experience I had gone through,\u201d said Belinda.\n\nWhen she was due, Belinda underwent a caesarean section and delivered a baby girl who despite bringing her joy, brought such pain in her early years of motherhood that she sank into depression.\n\n\u201cI was happy to hold the child in my arms. Things changed weeks after I was discharged from the hospital. My love for the child changed into hate as memories haunted me,\u201d said Belinda.\n\nShe revealed that it was a challenge for her to accept herself as a rape victim -- a label that left a scar in her life that made her hate herself to the extent of contemplating suicide and killing the baby.\n\n\u201cI tried ingesting poison three times but, miraculously, I survived the attempts. I stopped breastfeeding the child regularly and fed her with water. She miraculously remained healthy and strong,\u201d she said.\n\nIn an attempt to get over the ordeal, she moved to Nairobi in 2015 where she had another brief stint in the hospitality industry before she started battling with mental health issues.\n\nDepression took a toll on her as she moved in and out of different hospitals where the doctors couldn\u2019t pinpoint what had led to her deteriorating health.\n\n\u201cI didn\u2019t realise I was depressed. Instead, I was put under different types of medication which were of no help. I had become so weak that I needed help with everything,\u201d she said.\n\nIn 2017, her family linked her with a counsellor whom she says was pivotal in changing her perspective about her life and that of her child.\n\nBelinda enrolled at a Nakuru college for a technical course and graduated last week. She hopes to start a tailoring shop where she can put her skills to good use.\n\n\"Hopelessness at the beginning of my studies affected my performance. I now feel that my scars have to a great extent healed. I have a great love for my daughter whom I spend time with whenever I am free,\" she said.\n\nShe revealed that she is currently working on changing her perspective about men for whom she developed strong resentment since her ordeal.\n\nHer greatest task ahead remains opening up to her daughter when she raises the question about her father in future.\n\n\"I hope this will not affect my daughter when she finally learns the truth. My counsellor advised me to disclose the information to her at a certain age before she personally poses the question,\" she said.\n\nWhile her case is representative of many other incidents of gender-based violence (GBV), Belinda has urged similar victims to seek counselling in good time.\n\n\"It is easy to assume everything will be okay if one survived with no physical harm.

"Historians will forever debate on who between Charles Njonjo and Nicholas Biwott wielded the greatest clout.\n\nIn both the Kenyatta and Moi Cabinets only the foolhardy stepped on Njonjo\u2019s toes.\n\nBoth Presidents took the man, who had a penchant for pin-striped Savile Row three-piece suits invariably accessorised with a fresh carnation on the lapel, micro-dotted shirts and ornate timepieces, seriously.\n\nIn our continuing excerpts from Moi Cabinets: Drama, Intrigues and Triumphs, we look at the Kenyan high society would describe as a man of considerable culture and cultivation.\n\nDuring his colourful and often controversial career as Attorney General and Cabinet Minister, he often rode in the limousines of Presidents Jomo Kenyatta and Daniel arap Moi, and participated in the selection of ministers, ambassadors and other key members of Government.\n\nAt the pinnacle of his political career in 1983, the man nicknamed \u2018Duke of Kabeteshire\u2019 due to his English mannerisms was second only to Moi \u2013 despite not being the Vice President.\n\nDuring his 17-year stint at Sheria House as the Attorney General, Njonjo occasionally shocked the nation by expressing views that were diametrically opposed to the country\u2019s foreign policy or even that of the Organisation of African Unity (OAU), not to mention prevailing local sentiments.\n\nFor instance, he was widely known to be a proponent of continued white rule in Apartheid South Africa, Rhodesia (present-day Zimbabwe) and Mozambique; he wanted Kenya to maintain diplomatic ties with the pariah apartheid South African regime; he negotiated the Israeli military raid on Entebbe airport in Uganda to free Israeli hostages held by terrorist aeroplane hijackers; and he was strongly opposed to the existence of the tribal grouping known as the Gikuyu, Embu and Meru Association (GEMA), which he had registered in 1971 and thereafter sought to proscribe in 1976.\n\nTo his credit, Njonjo initiated many of the laws that transformed Kenya from a colony to a free and independent country and established the many institutions that became the bedrock of democracy and good governance in Kenya under Kenyatta\u2019s 15-year leadership.\n\nWhen he hit 60, Njonjo felt it was time to move on. In an orchestrated and well-choreographed move, he called a press conference to announce his resignation as AG and intention to contest the Kikuyu parliamentary seat, only a day after the incumbent MP resigned to allow Njonjo to vie for the seat.\n\nExactly as expected, he easily won the seat and transformed himself into a politician overnight. He was appointed Cabinet Minister in the specially-minted Ministry of Justice and Constitutional Affairs, a position he held until 1983.\n\nThe ministry strategically roped in the Judiciary and, as it was during his days as AG, Njonjo worked closely with the national security apparatus \u2013 making him the single most powerful person after the President.\n\nCome the August 1, 1982, attempted coup by elements within the Kenya Air Force and Njonjo\u2019s massive political edifice started slowly crumbling. After the putsch failed and as the suspected soldiers were court-martialled and politicians taken to court, Moi decided to purge the ruling party, KANU, and the Cabinet of those he believed wanted him out of power.\n\nAmong them was Njonjo, who was eventually labelled \u2018traitor\u2019 by fellow Cabinet Minister Elijah Mwangale.\n\nWhat followed was a protracted Judicial commission of inquiry that concluded Njonjo was guilty of abuse of office and that he had tried to take over power from President Moi.\n\nHe was forced to resign from Government, effectively destroying his political career.\n\nMoi and Njonjo would, years later, patch up things together.\n\nAnd, it wasn\u2019t only Njonjo who experienced the devastating effect of Moi\u2019s backhand.\n\nCHARLES WANYOIKE RUBIA\n\nIn September 1986, Charles Rubia was among a handful of MPs who defended clergymen when they were condemned by politicians for criticising the mlolongo (queue) system of voting.\n\nPresident Daniel arap Moi and other senior Kanu party officials had expressed a desire to replace the secret ballot system with mlolongo in nominating candidates for national elections.\n\nRubia argued that those criticising the clergy were violating the Constitution, which upheld freedom of speech as a right.\n\nIn December of that year, he was the lone MP to vote against the Constitutional Amendment Bill, which sought to abolish the office of Chief Secretary and remove security of tenure for the Attorney General, the Controller and the Auditor General.\n\nHe later defended the Law Society of Kenya and the National Council of Churches of Kenya following attacks by politicians for opposing the bill.\n\nOn May 3, 1990, Rubia and Kenneth Matiba called a press conference to urge for the return of multiparty democracy.\n\nAt the same time Smith Hempstone, the outspoken US ambassador to Kenya, made similar calls, saying the US favoured countries that nourished democratic institutions, defended human rights and practised multiparty politics.\n\nSo when Rubia, Matiba, Jaramogi Oginga Odinga and his son, Raila Odinga, met in early June 1990 to organise a public rally set for July in Nairobi\u2019s Kamukunji Constituency to advocate for multipartism, they were marked men.\n\nOn July 4, Rubia, Matiba and Raila were arrested and detained.

Others will go for the cathartic effect of holidays be it domestic or foreign tourism.\n\nBut there are diseases and allergies associated with travel: For some, trooping upcountry from the city for carousal with blood relations might see the sudden change in weather inducing flu.

He, however, noted that in the beginning, the traders were constantly harassed by Nairobi City Council officers and the police before they established themselves in the market.\n\nAt the time he joined politics, many children in the low-income constituency could not access basic schooling. In a speech he made in Parliament in June 1973 advocating for free primary school education for all, he said, \u201cUnless you have a good education to which every child has access and that can be harnessed to (enable them to) reach their full potential, you cannot build a sound population and a sound nation. It is about time somebody got the message that we want free primary education. Let every child in this country be entitled to at least eight years of free primary education.\u201d\n\nIn May 1990, while the Minister was on a tour of duty in Europe, Nairobi City Council bulldozers descended on the expansive Muoroto slums in his constituency and demolished everything in sight, scattering its 2,000 residents. Some believed the exercise had the tacit approval of the Government.

In a speech he made in Parliament in June 1973 advocating for free primary school education for all, he said, \u201cUnless you have a good education to which every child has access and that can be harnessed to (enable them to) reach their full potential, you cannot build a sound population and a sound nation. It is about time somebody got the message that we want free primary education.

From suave intellectuals, such as Kenya\u2019s fifth Vice President the historian Dr Josephat Karanja, to the simple politicians hoisted from rural Kenya to the skyscrapers of Nairobi and more significantly, dizzying positions of power where their word was the law.\n\nIt would be good when it lasted. Tragedy was then they fell foul of their boss and back to the grass it was. Sometimes through a terse 1pm KBC news bulletin.\n\nThat was a familiar feature of President Daniel arap Moi\u2019s cabinets whose vicissitudes are captured in Moi Cabinets, Drama, Intrigues, Triumphs by The Kenya Year Book and whose excerpts The Standard presents, walking you through the ups and downs in the lives of politicians who sat on Moi\u2019s council of ministers.\n\nBut who was the man behind the Cabinets?\n\nDaniel arap Moi served as the third Vice President Kenya, taking over as President in 1978 despite concerted efforts from a group of Government officials and politicians determined to ensure he did not become President.\n\nFew people know that at one point, as the opposition towards him turned to harassment, the VP drafted a letter of resignation.

Interference by unhealthy commodity industries has been a persistent obstacle to the government developing and implementing NCD policies.

"description": "Tilapia is the most preferred type of fish by consumers because of its taste.", "articleBody": "For many years now, Kisumu has been associated with one of the most loved delicacy \u2013 fish.\n\nMost tourists and residents thronged Dunga Beach and Lwang\u2019ni Beach, which was demolished in July 2019, to enjoy the delicacy, which hoteliers get directly from Lake Victoria.\n\nThe waterbody has, among others, tilapia fish which is the most-preferred fish in Kenyan households.\n\nThe rise in the popularity of tilapia previously elicited debate on how to determine an \u201coriginal\u201d one and an imported one from China.\n\nSome said the difference lies in the taste, while others claim it is the physical appearance that tells them apart.\n\nPopularly known as \u2018ngege\u2019 in Dholuo dialect, tilapia is the main culinary show that a Kisumu visitor would die for.\n\nHowever, there\u2019s a raging debate on which \u201csex\u201d of the breed is tastier. How do you tell whether the sweeter one is male or female? And how does one tell them apart? This is the dilemma fish-lovers are having, even as they enjoy their meals every day.\n\nThirty-five-year-old Fransiscah Awuor, who has been a fishmonger at Dunga Beach for over 18 years, said the female fish is sweeter compared to its male counterpart.\n\nShe says the female fish \u201chas eggs and is very soft\u201d.\n\n\u201cMost of my clients ask for fish that has eggs,\u201d said Awuor.\n\n\u201cThe structure of the fish determines whether it is male or female. The male fish has a slightly bigger head, and is longer compared to their female counterparts. The female ones, on the other hand, have a better shape, and are heavier. It is obvious why my clients ask for fish that has eggs. Having sold fish for many years, I know the female one tastes better than male ones,\u201d said Awuor.\n\nCharles Otieno, a fisherman at Dunga Beach for the past 20 years, argued that what the fish eats determines its taste, but noted that both male and female fish are sweet in equal measure.\n\n\u201cIt depends with where the fish stays in the lake. Most of the fish caught in the middle of the lake are exposed to a lot of food, which is also diverse. They are quite different from the ones near the shores, where they feed on remains of human foods,\u201d said Otieno.\n\nHe added: \u201cEven those in swollen rivers have lots of food. They taste better compared to those fished from small rivers. When the water level reduces, the production of food that fish eats also decreases. When you catch fish from the small rivers, you\u2019d realise they are not so delicious.\u201d\n\nIn the past, Otieno says, fishermen were less concerned about the gender of the fish they were catching.\n\n\u201cRecently, a new cage-farming technology was introduced. The technology allows the farmer to feed the two fish genders separately before mixing them,\u201d he said.\n\nSixty-four-year-old Maurice Ochieng, also a fisherman, said the female fish is believed to be sweeter because it has eggs and fats.\n\nOchieng said the female fish are softer, and that people who have lived near the lake, or have lengthy fishing experience, can differentiate the taste.\n\nChristopher Aura, the director of freshwater systems research at the Kenya Marine and Fisheries Research Institute (KMFRI), however, says the taste of fish depends on what they feed on, and not their sex.\n\n\u201cThe taste is brought about by the environment [the fish is bred in], and the genetic nature (type of fish). Taste also depends on the preference of the consumer, and it will vary from to person. One person will find the male one sweeter and not the female one, and vice versa. It is important to note that the available ecosystem determines what the fish feeds on,\u201d he explained.\n\nTilapia feeds on small plants in water, while the Nile perch mostly feeds on other small fishes, basically flesh, he said.\n\nAura noted that the male fish grows faster compared to its female counterpart. The female fish dedicates much of its food assimilation in production of eggs.\n\nAccording to experts, an average Kenyan consumes 4.5 kilograms of fish each year.\n\n\u201cI urge Kenyans to eat tilapia frequently because it is white meat; it\u2019s healthy, and has no side effects. The fish type is also associated with good fats like the \u2018Omega 3\u2019, which is useful in brain development,\u201d he added\n\nHe said tilapia is the preferred type of fish by most consumers because of its taste.\n\n\u201cTilapia fish can survive in poor environment, and is present in several tropical areas,\u201d he said.\n\n\u201cYou will be able to find tilapia in dams, small water bodies, and even lakes. Other types of fish are also good for consumption. For example, \u2018omena\u2019 is a good source of iron for young babies,\u201d he said.", "articleBodyHtml": "<article>\n\n<p>For many years now, Kisumu has been associated with one of the most loved delicacy \u2013 fish.</p>\n\n<p>Most tourists and residents thronged Dunga Beach and Lwang\u2019ni Beach, which was demolished in July 2019, to enjoy the delicacy, which hoteliers get directly from Lake Victoria.</p>\n\n<p>The waterbody has, among others, tilapia fish which is the most-preferred fish in Kenyan households.</p>\n\n<p>The rise in the popularity of tilapia previously elicited debate on how to determine an \u201coriginal\u201d one and an imported one from China.</p>\n\n<p>Some said the difference lies in the taste, while others claim it is the physical appearance that tells them apart.</p>\n\n<p>Popularly known as \u2018ngege\u2019 in Dholuo dialect, tilapia is the main culinary show that a Kisumu visitor would die for.</p>\n\n<p>However, there\u2019s a raging debate on which \u201csex\u201d of the breed is tastier.

The technology allows the farmer to feed the two fish genders separately before mixing them,\u201d he said.</p>\n\n<p>Sixty-four-year-old Maurice Ochieng, also a fisherman, said the female fish is believed to be sweeter because it has eggs and fats.</p>\n\n<p>Ochieng said the female fish are softer, and that people who have lived near the lake, or have lengthy fishing experience, can differentiate the taste.</p>\n\n<p>Christopher Aura, the director of freshwater systems research at the Kenya Marine and Fisheries Research Institute (KMFRI), however, says the taste of fish depends on what they feed on, and not their sex.</p>\n\n<p>\u201cThe taste is brought about by the environment [the fish is bred in], and the genetic nature (type of fish). Taste also depends on the preference of the consumer, and it will vary from to person. One person will find the male one sweeter and not the female one, and vice versa. It is important to note that the available ecosystem determines what the fish feeds on,\u201d he explained.</p>\n\n<p>Tilapia feeds on small plants in water, while the Nile perch mostly feeds on other small fishes, basically flesh, he said.</p>\n\n<p>Aura noted that the male fish grows faster compared to its female counterpart. The female fish dedicates much of its food assimilation in production of eggs.</p>\n\n<p>According to experts, an average Kenyan consumes 4.5 kilograms of fish each year.</p>\n\n<p>\u201cI urge Kenyans to eat tilapia frequently because it is white meat; it\u2019s healthy, and has no side effects. The fish type is also associated with good fats like the \u2018Omega 3\u2019, which is useful in brain development,\u201d he added</p>\n\n<p>He said tilapia is the preferred type of fish by most consumers because of its taste.</p>\n\n<p>\u201cTilapia fish can survive in poor environment, and is present in several tropical areas,\u201d he said.</p>\n\n<p>\u201cYou will be able to find tilapia in dams, small water bodies, and even lakes. Other types of fish are also good for consumption. For example, \u2018omena\u2019 is a good source of iron for young babies,\u201d he said.</p>\n\n</article>", "canonicalUrl": "https://www.standardmedia.co.ke/health/nutrition-wellness/article/2001430955/is-female-fish-sweeter"},{"url": "https://www.standardmedia.co.ke/health/article/2001430895/covid-cases-rise-by-99-positivity-rate-at-2-per-cent", "probability": 0.99315506, "headline": "Covid cases rise by 99, positivity rate at 2 per cent", "datePublished": "2021-12-03T17:45:57+03:00", "datePublishedRaw": "Fri,Dec 03 2021 17:45:57 EAT", "dateModified": "2021-12-03T17:45:57+03:00", "dateModifiedRaw": "Fri,Dec 03 2021 17:45:57 EAT", "author": "BETTY NJERU | Fri,Dec 03 2021 17:45:57 EAT", "authorsList": ["BETTY NJERU | Fri", "Dec 03 2021 17:45:57 EAT"], "inLanguage": "en", "breadcrumbs": [{"name": "Health & Science", "link": "https://www.standardmedia.co.ke/health/category/41/health-science"}], "mainImage": "https://cdn.standardmedia.co.ke/images/friday/ovgpepkjgz3bspab3v61aa2e456fd9a.jpg", "images": ["https://cdn.standardmedia.co.ke/images/friday/ovgpepkjgz3bspab3v61aa2e456fd9a.jpg"], "description": "95 people test positive for Covid-19 from 4,799 samples in last 24 hours placing positivity rate at 2 per cent; 22 patients recover", "articleBody": "Some ninety-five people have tested positive for the coronavirus today, from 4,799 samples conducted in the last 24 hours.\n\nKenya\u2019s positivity rate is now 2 per cent, with total confirmed cases at 255,355 and 2,848,757 tests conducted since the onset of the disease last year in March.\n\nHealth Cabinet Secretary Mutahi Kagwe in a statement said an additional twenty-two patients have recovered from the disease, \u201cwith thirteen discharged from the Home-Based Isolation and Care program while nine are from various health facilities countrywide.\u201d\n\nNo Covid-19 related death has been reported in the latest statistics, with fatalities remaining 5,335.\n\n\u201cA total of one hundred and seventy patients are currently admitted in various health facilities countrywide, while 815 are under the Home-Based Isolation and Care program.

Thus, no one can critique politics in Kenya without mentioning him.", "articleBody": "Today, we witness Raila Odinga\u2019s take off officially as 2022 presidential candidate. When we admitted Baba in January 2020, he was not where he is today. He has proved to be politically astute, graduating from an enigma to a political principality. So, the political heavens qualify him to contest in 2022 with one condition: He should read all that has been written about in this column before.\n\nWhen I say that Raila is a political principality, I mean he rules our political firmaments. Thus, no one can critique politics in Kenya without mentioning him.\n\nWhat can we say then? Raila has renewed his political body. Baba is soaring like an eagle, having knocked his political beak, plucked out his talons and feathers. Isn't that why we are saying that he is climbing Mount Kenya like an eaglet? The way things are going, he is closest to the presidency than any other time before.\n\nSo what makes Raila highly competitive for the 2022 presidency? First, with the support of the incumbent and the many Kenyans who have no taste for William Ruto\u2019s hustler movement, Baba has one option\u2014to be on the ballot.\n\nRaila won\u2019t have to spend a lot of energy self-marketing; his soldiers are many, and his chances are high. Political heavens are satisfied that he is stronger politically now than ever.\n\nSecondly, Raila is considered strong enough to compete with Ruto. He has so far crafted a politically copyrightable strategy and a blueprint. The Azimio la Umoja and the promise of Sh6,000 for poor Kenyans as unemployment benefits are politically unique and executable.\n\nThirdly, Raila has the advantage of a clean history. His political pilgrimage is not dotted with corruption and theft of public resources. He must capitalise on this history to build his Tower of Babel toward the political \u2018Canaan\u2019.\n\nFourth is his age\u2014going by Plato\u2019s conceptualisation of a philosopher-king, a person who should be mature, have the experience, and pursue the country's good rather than self-interest, Raila has no comparison. He is at the age when he can focus on his legacy rather than accumulating power and wealth.\n\nOn January 7, 2023, a few months after his swearing-in, if he is elected president, he will hit 78 years\u2014younger than Joe Biden at his inauguration as the president of the United States. As such, age cannot be used to pull down Raila\u2019s dream of ruling Kenya. So far, Kibaki remains the oldest Kenyan to have been sworn in as president (at 71 years), while Uhuru was youngest at 53 years. Kibaki\u2019s track record implies that senior citizens leave long-lasting legacies and track records as presidents.\n\nHaving said that, there are minor corrections that Baba should focus on in his final State House lap.

When we admitted Baba in January 2020, he was not where he is today. He has proved to be politically astute, graduating from an enigma to a political principality. So, the political heavens qualify him to contest in 2022 with one condition: He should read all that has been written about in this column before.</p>\n\n<p>When I say that Raila is a political principality, I mean he rules our political firmaments. Thus, no one can critique politics in Kenya without mentioning him.</p>\n\n<p>What can we say then? Raila has renewed his political body. Baba is soaring like an eagle, having knocked his political beak, plucked out his talons and feathers. Isn't that why we are saying that he is climbing Mount Kenya like an eaglet? The way things are going, he is closest to the presidency than any other time before.</p>\n\n<p>So what makes Raila highly competitive for the 2022 presidency? First, with the support of the incumbent and the many Kenyans who have no taste for William Ruto\u2019s hustler movement, Baba has one option\u2014to be on the ballot.</p>\n\n<p>Raila won\u2019t have to spend a lot of energy self-marketing; his soldiers are many, and his chances are high. Political heavens are satisfied that he is stronger politically now than ever.</p>\n\n<p>Secondly, Raila is considered strong enough to compete with Ruto. He has so far crafted a politically copyrightable strategy and a blueprint. The Azimio la Umoja and the promise of Sh6,000 for poor Kenyans as unemployment benefits are politically unique and executable.</p>\n\n<p>Thirdly, Raila has the advantage of a clean history. His political pilgrimage is not dotted with corruption and theft of public resources. He must capitalise on this history to build his Tower of Babel toward the political \u2018Canaan\u2019.</p>\n\n<p>Fourth is his age\u2014going by Plato\u2019s conceptualisation of a philosopher-king, a person who should be mature, have the experience, and pursue the country's good rather than self-interest, Raila has no comparison. He is at the age when he can focus on his legacy rather than accumulating power and wealth.</p>\n\n<p>On January 7, 2023, a few months after his swearing-in, if he is elected president, he will hit 78 years\u2014younger than Joe Biden at his inauguration as the president of the United States. As such, age cannot be used to pull down Raila\u2019s dream of ruling Kenya. So far, Kibaki remains the oldest Kenyan to have been sworn in as president (at 71 years), while Uhuru was youngest at 53 years. Kibaki\u2019s track record implies that senior citizens leave long-lasting legacies and track records as presidents.</p>\n\n<p>Having said that, there are minor corrections that Baba should focus on in his final State House lap. First, he must choose his running mate wisely and immediately. If Raila doesn't name one today, we must not see 2022 without knowing who it is. From now, he badly needs someone to take the gruelling campaign trails across Kenya.</p>\n\n<p>Moreover, the Raila strategy team must concentrate on building Raila the brand\u2014He should not be overworked. Baba\u2019s speeches must avoid historical narrations and the BBI. His nemeses have already weaponised the two issues against him. Aren\u2019t other suggestions recorded in the annals of this column?

Several nations, especially from the West, immediately imposed travel restrictions on all traffic from certain southern Africa nations that had reported the variant.\n\nThe response from Africa was not only swift but vicious.

Why should we spend so much energy castigating governments simply fulfilling their mandate of protecting their citizens from an unknown variant of a deadly virus?\n\nIn any case, such restrictions have been applied before by and upon other non-African nations. The US, for example, on November 8 lifted the entry ban in place for almost twenty months on travellers from 33 countries \u2013 including 26 EU countries, Ireland, and the UK. Had this been discriminatory, racist, or colonialist?\n\nTruth be told, this vitriol against the developed world is neither new nor isolated. It is becoming increasingly fashionable for Africans to bash the western world for our woes.\n\nOf course it is a fact of history that developed nations have exploited Africa. Our men and women were mercilessly carted away in ships like goats to slave markets. Our minerals and natural resources have been exploited without shame. But 60 years after political independence, Africa should have charted its own destiny.\n\nUnfortunately, the continent remains largely economically dependent. The scarcity mentality that pervades this great continent has been our greatest undoing.\n\nNearly every African who gets any opportunity for service or leadership, takes up the responsibility with one single objective \u2013 grab as much as I can while stocks last. Thus, almost all nations of Africa are found at the top (or is it bottom) of the corruption index. This leaves Africa a net beggar \u2013 extending the charity bowl for almost all essential goods and services.\n\nThe truth is no one who consistently cries at the gate of his neighbour to be assisted with food can be taken seriously at the baraza of elders.\n\nWorse still, when such a person is doled some food for children but consumes it all by himself, they cannot expect to be trusted with more. Likewise, a man who idles at the market square while people are at work will inevitably lose his voice and dignity among peers.\n\nThus, while we celebrate scientists in South Africa \u2013 a nation with the most sophisticated genomic sequencing facilities on the continent \u2013 we must ask ourselves some hard questions. Where is the research by our doctors on vaccines?\n\nWhat contribution are our universities making to the repository of applied knowledge? Why should we remain so dependent on solutions from our neighbours when some of the best brains are found in Africa?\n\nWho bewitched us that even resources meant to save our people get siphoned into pockets of well-connected individuals? Yet, we lament at the slightest action taken by our western neighbours in the interest of their citizens.\n\nI fear that the more Africa complains and laments over minor issues, the more we reduce our value and relevance in the global arena.

The US, for example, on November 8 lifted the entry ban in place for almost twenty months on travellers from 33 countries \u2013 including 26 EU countries, Ireland, and the UK. Had this been discriminatory, racist, or colonialist?</p>\n\n<p>Truth be told, this vitriol against the developed world is neither new nor isolated. It is becoming increasingly fashionable for Africans to bash the western world for our woes.</p>\n\n<p>Of course it is a fact of history that developed nations have exploited Africa. Our men and women were mercilessly carted away in ships like goats to slave markets. Our minerals and natural resources have been exploited without shame. But 60 years after political independence, Africa should have charted its own destiny.</p>\n\n<p>Unfortunately, the continent remains largely economically dependent. The scarcity mentality that pervades this great continent has been our greatest undoing.</p>\n\n<p>Nearly every African who gets any opportunity for service or leadership, takes up the responsibility with one single objective \u2013 grab as much as I can while stocks last. Thus, almost all nations of Africa are found at the top (or is it bottom) of the corruption index. This leaves Africa a net beggar \u2013 extending the charity bowl for almost all essential goods and services.</p>\n\n<p>The truth is no one who consistently cries at the gate of his neighbour to be assisted with food can be taken seriously at the baraza of elders.</p>\n\n<p>Worse still, when such a person is doled some food for children but consumes it all by himself, they cannot expect to be trusted with more. Likewise, a man who idles at the market square while people are at work will inevitably lose his voice and dignity among peers.</p>\n\n<p>Thus, while we celebrate scientists in South Africa \u2013 a nation with the most sophisticated genomic sequencing facilities on the continent \u2013 we must ask ourselves some hard questions. Where is the research by our doctors on vaccines?</p>\n\n<p>What contribution are our universities making to the repository of applied knowledge? Why should we remain so dependent on solutions from our neighbours when some of the best brains are found in Africa?</p>\n\n<p>Who bewitched us that even resources meant to save our people get siphoned into pockets of well-connected individuals? Yet, we lament at the slightest action taken by our western neighbours in the interest of their citizens.</p>\n\n<p>I fear that the more Africa complains and laments over minor issues, the more we reduce our value and relevance in the global arena. The negotiating table is never for puppies that wait for crumbs to fall from the table, but for serious contributors to the potluck.</p>\n\n</article>", "canonicalUrl": "https://www.standardmedia.co.ke/columnists/article/2001430994/africa-must-stop-crying-in-the-market-and-work-for-dignity"},{"url": "https://www.standardmedia.co.ke/columnists/article/2001430891/to-cement-his-legacy-uhuru-must-slay-dragon-of-impunity", "probability": 0.98669934, "headline": "To cement his legacy, Uhuru must slay dragon of impunity", "datePublished": "2021-12-03T18:00:00+03:00", "datePublishedRaw": "Fri, 03 Dec 2021 18:00:00 EAT", "dateModified": "2021-12-03T18:00:00+03:00", "dateModifiedRaw": "Fri, 03 Dec 2021 18:00:00 EAT ", "author": "Irungu Houghton", "authorsList": ["Irungu Houghton"], "inLanguage": "en", "breadcrumbs": [{"name": "Home", "link": "https://www.standardmedia.co.ke"}, {"name": "Columnists", "link": "https://www.standardmedia.co.ke/category/74/columnists"}, {"name": "To cement his legacy, Uhuru must slay dragon of impunity ", "link": "https://www.standardmedia.co.ke/columnists/article/2001430891/to-cement-his-legacy-uhuru-must-slay-dragon-of-impunity"}], "mainImage": "https://cdn.standardmedia.co.ke/images/friday/idgtshcb9pmjojcrud61aa251295d57.jpg", "images": ["https://cdn.standardmedia.co.ke/images/friday/idgtshcb9pmjojcrud61aa251295d57.jpg"], "description": "Has corruption been crushed or was the issue of leadership integrity socially distanced from the President\u2019s speech?", "articleBody": "Wednesday\u2019s lengthy State of the Nation address departed from past presidential addresses in two ways.

Even then, there are lone voices crying that the committee needs to leave \u2018their\u2019 cricket alone. These voices in the wilderness where they are stuck with archaic ideas are responsible for the mess that prompted the Sports ministry to step in.</p>\n\n<p>Some of them will probably seek elective posts to run cricket. It is an open secret that if they win, cricket will go back to its deathbed because they have unfinished scores to settle and will concentrate on those.</p>\n\n<p>Inasmuch as they are veterans of Kenyan cricket and were good cricketers, modern cricket does not need their attitude. What Kenyan cricket - and football - need is not just fresh blood, but new thinking, and the cricket veterans lack that. As such, they are not fit to hold any managerial positions in Cricket Kenya.</p>\n\n</article>", "canonicalUrl": "https://www.standardmedia.co.ke/clay-muganda/article/2001431018/kenyan-cricket-and-football-too-need-new-thinking-and-not-just-veterans-or-fresh-blood"},{"url": "https://www.standardmedia.co.ke/kamotho-waiganjo/article/2001430909/populist-ideas-may-surprise-you-in-next-years-elections", "probability": 0.9783983, "headline": "Populist ideas may surprise you in next year\u2019s elections", "datePublished": "2021-12-04T07:30:00+03:00", "datePublishedRaw": "Sat, 04 Dec 2021 07:30:00 EAT", "dateModified": "2021-12-04T07:30:00+03:00", "dateModifiedRaw": "Sat, 04 Dec 2021 07:30:00 EAT ", "author": "Kamotho Waiganjo", "authorsList": ["Kamotho Waiganjo"], "inLanguage": "en", "breadcrumbs": [{"name": "Home", "link": "https://www.standardmedia.co.ke"}, {"name": "Columnists", "link": "https://www.standardmedia.co.ke/category/74/columnists"}, {"name": "Kamotho Waiganjo", "link": "https://www.standardmedia.co.ke/category/360/kamotho-waiganjo"}, {"name": "Populist ideas may surprise you in next year\u2019s elections", "link": "https://www.standardmedia.co.ke/kamotho-waiganjo/article/2001430909/populist-ideas-may-surprise-you-in-next-years-elections"}], "mainImage": "https://cdn.standardmedia.co.ke/images/friday/jixobulcbkxwn61aa47db1eaf4.jpg", "images": ["https://cdn.standardmedia.co.ke/images/friday/jixobulcbkxwn61aa47db1eaf4.jpg"], "description": "Many citizens, particularly our buoyant youth, feel disenfranchised and are reeling from the impact of a struggling economy.", "articleBody": "Harrison rallies Gor fans ahead of Caf tie\n\nGor Mahia lost 1-0 to AS Otoho d\u2019Oyo in Congo last Sunday and have to score two goals without reply to be sure of reaching the group stages.\n\nLet Nakuru City set pace for real urban planning\n\nNakuru City should seek to be different.
