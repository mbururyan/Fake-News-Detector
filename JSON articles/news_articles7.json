Raila Odinga congratulated Uhuru Kenyatta for work done on Uhuru Gardens, saying it showed his vision as president.", "articleBody": "Just after the historic Azimio Convention where Raila Amolo Odinga launched his presidential bid for 2022 on December 10th, causing so many unsettled stomachs among his rivals who were hoping for a lukewarm event which was supposed to be boycotted by President Uhuru, something else happened that has thrown that mob into some form of seizure.\n\nPresident Uhuru not only invited his new buddy, Raila Odinga to the celebrations at Uhuru Gardens, but the president also did something unthinkable to those praying night and day that somehow Uhuru will just dump Odinga, and give Ruto some breathing room or better still support Gideon Moi for the presidency. That is their latest wishful thinking after realizing Uhuru is not putting up with Ruto for 2022. Now they are hoping Uhuru goes with Gideon Moi.\n\nWhat Uhuru did at the Uhuru Gardens is to invite Raila right as he was giving his presidential speech to come to the podium and have a few words for the nation. That is unheard of and is a clear sign of politicians and friends who want to work together for the country.\n\nAnd the topic of discussion at that time was about land grabbing and the hoodlums who just grab public land everywhere.\n\nTurns out that Uhuru Gardens and the museum being built there had actually been grabbed by none other than our resident land thief with no shame and Uhuru had to take it back and build it as a public facility.\n\nThose land thieves were not just unhappy that their attempted land grab was thwarted and land taken back but they were even more annoyed that President Uhuru is giving Raila such a national platform to say a few words to Kenyans, and damn it Raila was taking the opportunity to talk about the evil that land grabbers commit against Kenyans.\n\nRaila Odinga congratulated Uhuru Kenyatta for work done on Uhuru Gardens, saying it showed his vision as president. Raila revealed that the president had recovered the land from grabbers.\n\n\u201cPeople are going to be surprised at what you\u2019ve done here.\u201d\n\nRaila revealed that the land had been grabbed by those who see open space and cannot stop themselves from grabbing them.\n\nAfter the Azimio Convention, the Ruto crowd with their ritual singing at his cathedral in Karen were hoping that things go quiet and they can ignore Raila. Not anymore. The Ruto mob has spent the last two days talking about nothing else but Raila, and their new failing message that Uhuru is trying to force people to vote for the Azimio la Umoja Movement leader.\n\n\u201cWe will not be intimidated,\u201d the likes of Rigathi Gachagua keep screaming.

That is their latest wishful thinking after realizing Uhuru is not putting up with Ruto for 2022. Now they are hoping Uhuru goes with Gideon Moi.</p>\n\n<p>What Uhuru did at the Uhuru Gardens is to invite Raila right as he was giving his presidential speech to come to the podium and have a few words for the nation. That is unheard of and is a clear sign of politicians and friends who want to work together for the country.</p>\n\n<p>And the topic of discussion at that time was about land grabbing and the hoodlums who just grab public land everywhere.</p>\n\n<p>Turns out that Uhuru Gardens and the museum being built there had actually been grabbed by none other than our resident land thief with no shame and Uhuru had to take it back and build it as a public facility.</p>\n\n<p>Those land thieves were not just unhappy that their attempted land grab was thwarted and land taken back but they were even more annoyed that President Uhuru is giving Raila such a national platform to say a few words to Kenyans, and damn it Raila was taking the opportunity to talk about the evil that land grabbers commit against Kenyans.</p>\n\n<p>Raila Odinga congratulated Uhuru Kenyatta for work done on Uhuru Gardens, saying it showed his vision as president.

The story of Finn Akinyi Okewo, an alumnus of Maseno university who quit her teaching job three years ago, to organise women and girls into a worthy cause, is worth emulation.", "articleBody": "Gender violence and attacks against women are a menace in the country with very limited resources set aside to address the issues that affect them in general.\n\nThe past couple of days have been a nightmare to parents in Kenya, more so those with girls. Within the last one week alone, approximately 10 girls have either been kidnapped, assaulted, defiled or and murdered. Some have been reported missing and are yet to be traced.\n\nStatistics and research both locally and internationally have revealed that amid the Covid-19 pandemic, cases of gender-based violence have been on a higher rise.\n\nIn Kenya for instance, women and girls are at more risk of being assaulted or murdered by their partners and lovers than anywhere else in East Africa. This is why it is important, as a matter of crisis to address these issues putting women\u2019s lives at risk.\n\nToday in Kenya, just a handful of organizations are committed to the welfare and well-being of girls and women. We are still struggling to take off, and the few that are available also lack the necessary infrastructural support from relevant state agencies ( which are cash strapped) and have limited resources to cater for the same.\n\nThe story of Finn Akinyi Okewo, an alumnus of Maseno university who quit her teaching job three years ago, to organise women and girls into a worthy cause, is worth emulation. Finn, a holder of Masters degree in Education, Communications with IT also from Maseno, currently coordinates the activities of Project Forty One \u2013 a community-based organisation in Kisumu that is all about protecting and advancing the interests of women and young girls in the county.\n\n\u201dBiggest challenge affecting women who have been subjected to different forms of violence is the lack of support from the relevant authorities such as the police. There is also a stigma in the society where victims are viewed as lesser beings hence they opt to remain quiet and suffer in silence rather than be subjected to victimization,\u201d the Project Forty One co-ordinator says.\n\nAccording to government data, 45 percent of women and girls aged 15 to 49 have experienced physical violence and 14 percent have experienced sexual violence. Most of these cases are not reported to the authorities because Kenya has normalized the abuse of women and is more committed to protecting perpetrators (especially if they are male) than victims.\n\n\u201dWe are a country that protects men at all costs \u2013 even at the cost of the lives of women. We have zero regards for family unity. And even more outrageously, Kenya is obsessed with how the oppressed react, more than on the structures that exist and which birth such kinds of reaction,\u201d she adds.\n\nIt is for these reasons that organizations such as Project 41 come into the picture to give victims the confidence to speak out as well as ensure women are protected in aspects of their lives. A question of why number Forty-One, she says their cause is not a shortsighted one and intends to go beyond Kisumu, Kenya and even reach out to other women and girls in East Africa.\n\n\u201dForty One million is a good place to start in this part of Africa. We have to squad up. Women and girls in Kisumu face the same issues, as their counterparts in Nyeri, Nairobi. Or Arusha, or Kampala. If we do not join hands to fight back, we will perish.\u201d\n\nLast week, ODM leader Raila Odinga condemned the escalating cases of violence against women and children currently being witnessed in the country.

Within the last one week alone, approximately 10 girls have either been kidnapped, assaulted, defiled or and murdered. Some have been reported missing and are yet to be traced.</p>\n\n<p>Statistics and research both locally and internationally have revealed that amid the Covid-19 pandemic, cases of gender-based violence have been on a higher rise.</p>\n\n<p>In Kenya for instance, women and girls are at more risk of being assaulted or murdered by their partners and lovers than anywhere else in East Africa. This is why it is important, as a matter of crisis to address these issues putting women\u2019s lives at risk.</p>\n\n<p>Today in Kenya, just a handful of organizations are committed to the welfare and well-being of girls and women.  We are still struggling to take off, and the few that are available also lack the necessary infrastructural support from relevant state agencies ( which are cash strapped) and have limited resources to cater for the same.</p>\n\n<p>The story of Finn Akinyi Okewo, an alumnus of Maseno university who quit her teaching job three years ago, to organise women and girls into a worthy cause, is worth emulation. Finn, a holder of  Masters degree in Education, Communications with IT also from Maseno, currently coordinates the activities of Project Forty One \u2013 a community-based organisation in Kisumu that is all about protecting and advancing the interests of women and young girls in the county.</p>\n\n<figure><img src=\"https://hivipunde.online/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/639ee256-46a4-4da7-918f-883f555bfa8f-1024x1024.jpg\" alt=\"\" srcset=\"https://hivipunde.online/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/639ee256-46a4-4da7-918f-883f555bfa8f-1024x1024.jpg 1024w, https://hivipunde.online/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/639ee256-46a4-4da7-918f-883f555bfa8f-300x300.jpg 300w, https://hivipunde.online/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/639ee256-46a4-4da7-918f-883f555bfa8f-150x150.jpg 150w, https://hivipunde.online/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/639ee256-46a4-4da7-918f-883f555bfa8f-768x768.jpg 768w, https://hivipunde.online/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/639ee256-46a4-4da7-918f-883f555bfa8f-480x480.jpg 480w, https://hivipunde.online/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/639ee256-46a4-4da7-918f-883f555bfa8f.jpg 1080w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px\"></figure>\n\n<p>\u201dBiggest challenge affecting women who have been subjected to different forms of violence is the lack of support from the relevant authorities such as the police. There is also a stigma in the society where victims are viewed as lesser beings hence they opt to remain quiet and suffer in silence rather than be subjected to victimization,\u201d the Project Forty One co-ordinator says.</p>\n\n<p>According to government data, 45 percent of women and girls aged 15 to 49 have experienced physical violence and 14 percent have experienced sexual violence. Most of these cases are not reported to the authorities because Kenya has normalized the abuse of women and is more committed to protecting perpetrators  (especially if they are male) than victims.</p>\n\n<p>\u201dWe are a country that protects men at all costs \u2013 even at the cost of the lives of women. We have zero regards for family unity. And even more outrageously,  Kenya is obsessed with how the oppressed react, more than on the structures that exist  and which birth such kinds of reaction,\u201d  she adds.</p>\n\n<p>It is for these reasons that organizations such as Project 41 come into the picture to give victims the confidence to speak out as well as ensure women are protected in aspects of their lives. A question of why number Forty-One, she says their cause is not a shortsighted one and intends to go beyond Kisumu, Kenya and even reach out to other women and girls in East Africa.</p>\n\n<p>\u201dForty One million is a good place to start in this part of Africa. We have to squad up. Women and girls in Kisumu face the same issues, as their counterparts in Nyeri, Nairobi. Or Arusha, or Kampala. If we do not join hands to fight back, we will perish.\u201d</p>\n\n<figure><img src=\"https://hivipunde.online/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/7d929bb9-60cd-4396-890d-8c1e4b0785ab.jpg\" alt=\"Project 41\" srcset=\"https://hivipunde.online/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/7d929bb9-60cd-4396-890d-8c1e4b0785ab.jpg 848w, https://hivipunde.online/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/7d929bb9-60cd-4396-890d-8c1e4b0785ab-300x200.jpg 300w, https://hivipunde.online/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/7d929bb9-60cd-4396-890d-8c1e4b0785ab-768x512.jpg 768w, https://hivipunde.online/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/7d929bb9-60cd-4396-890d-8c1e4b0785ab-720x480.jpg 720w, https://hivipunde.online/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/7d929bb9-60cd-4396-890d-8c1e4b0785ab-480x320.jpg 480w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 848px) 100vw, 848px\"><figcaption>A section of the team</figcaption></figure>\n\n<p>Last week, ODM leader Raila Odinga condemned the escalating cases of violence against women and children currently being witnessed in the country.

In our culture, we start by repaying the older debt and the latest debt we sort it later. We will also repay his father even though he died.\u2019</p>\n\n<p>\u201cI want to tell you that we have made our minds and have decided that we will support Raila. Those who are saying we are not honest, I want to tell them that we have spoken with the boss (President Uhuru Kenyatta) and he has told us that is where we are,\u201d posed Mwathi.</p>\n\n<p>His remarks come few days after Raila held a mega meeting in Nyeri where a section of Mt Kenya leaders endorsed him as their preferred presidential aspirant.</p>\n\n<p>On Friday, the former prime minister is expected to give the country the way forward  during his Azimio la Umoja national convention in Nairobi.</p>\n\n</article>", "canonicalUrl": "https://hivipunde.online/limuru-mp-it-is-time-mt-kenya-rewarded-raila-with-the-presidency/"},{"url": "https://hivipunde.online/nightmares-had-me-resign-from-my-mortuary-attendant-job/", "probability": 0.9973591, "headline": "Nightmares had me resign from my mortuary attendant job", "datePublished": "2021-12-06T00:00:00", "datePublishedRaw": "December 6, 2021", "author": "Hivi Punde", "authorsList": ["Hivi Punde"], "inLanguage": "en", "mainImage": "https://hivipunde.online/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/Mortuary-attendant.jpg", "images": ["https://hivipunde.online/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/Mortuary-attendant.jpg"], "description": "I liked my job as a mortuary attendant at the Nairobi City mortuary.

I have been living with my wife Stela for the last 8 years where we have two kids where both are girls.\n\nLike any other marriage, our life had been with a lot of challenges as always expected so ours was not an exception. I had a younger brother who was still a student in the university and so sometimes we would visit him with my wife each particular time we thought it was necessary.\n\nMost of the time my wife had an extended conversation with my younger brother each time we visited him. They went to the point of sharing contacts for further communication. As time went by my wife started calling and texting him. One day as my wife had gone to take a shower I happened to go through her phone where I got wonders. She had texted my younger brother that he was such a lovely person and maybe someday she was to offer him something even bigger.\n\nI went on reading the text messages and there was also a series of love emojis that the two had really sent each other. Surprisingly my wife had told my young brother that I was just a lazy born when it came to satisfying her in bed and therefore she was to offer him a chance to power her engine since she had a sex dry spell that really wanted to be cast by a person that was a guru.\n\nI did not bother asking her about it but I just kept quiet and pretended everything was in order for I wanted no argument with her at that particular time for I wanted things just to work out in our marriage. One Saturday my wife said she was going to visit her parents and so I let her leave the house. She had overstayed for a week and so I took the step of calling her but the line said she was busy most of the time. I decided to call her parents where they told me that she was not around and she had not informed them that she was to visit them. I guessed and took the step of visiting my brother\u2019s place.\n\nWhen I reached there, I found her sitting by my younger brother\u2019s coach wearing lingerie exposing her thighs. I knew they had some sex and now it was resting time. The atmosphere in the house is also revealed. I also saw pregnancy prevention pills by the table a clear indication that the cookie was broken. She shouted to me that my brother was far miles away when it came to romance.\n\nI just walked away from the house for I wanted zero commotion. When leaving my younger brother\u2019s place, I met Jack where I shared my story with him. He was really amused by the incident and so he said he had a solution to ensure everything was in order. He introduced me to herbalists called Kiwanga Doctors. The following day I went into their offices ready for redemption.\n\nI was attended to and later went back home. After two days my younger brother called me saying he wanted us to meet and end this sin for once. We met where he apologized plus my wife really wailed for an apology. From that day my wife has never repeated since I had improved my romantic game since I was given sweetening oils which really have played important role in ensuring that I remain romantic each day. We are now living happily with my wife as that love was once restored.\n\nKiwanga Doctors solve marriage problems, winning court cases, lotteries just to mention a few. They also cast hex spells. Black magic spells just within the span of three days and everything will be in order.

I had a younger brother who was still a student in the university and so sometimes we would visit him with my wife each particular time we thought it was necessary.</p>\n\n<p>Most of the time my wife had an extended conversation with my younger brother each time we visited him. They went to the point of sharing contacts for further communication. As time went by my wife started calling and texting him. One day as my wife had gone to take a shower I happened to go through her phone where I got wonders. She had texted my younger brother that he was such a lovely person and maybe someday she was to offer him something even bigger.</p>\n\n<p>I went on reading the text messages and there was also a series of love emojis that the two had really sent each other. Surprisingly my wife had told my young brother that I was just a lazy born when it came to satisfying her in bed and therefore she was to offer him a chance to power her engine since she had a sex dry spell that really wanted to be cast by a person that was a guru.</p>\n\n<p>I did not bother asking her about it but I just kept quiet and pretended everything was in order for I wanted no argument with her at that particular time for I wanted things just to work out in our marriage. One Saturday my wife said she was going to visit her parents and so I let her leave the house. She had overstayed for a week and so I took the step of calling her but the line said she was busy most of the time. I decided to call her parents where they told me that she was not around and she had not informed them that she was to visit them. I guessed and took the step of visiting my brother\u2019s place.</p>\n\n<p>When I reached there, I found her sitting by my younger brother\u2019s coach wearing lingerie exposing her thighs. I knew they had some sex and now it was resting time. The atmosphere in the house is also revealed. I also saw pregnancy prevention pills by the table a clear indication that the cookie was broken. She shouted to me that my brother was far miles away when it came to romance.</p>\n\n<p>I just walked away from the house for I wanted zero commotion. When leaving my younger brother\u2019s place, I met Jack where I shared my story with him. He was really amused by the incident and so he said he had a solution to ensure everything was in order. He introduced me to herbalists called\u00a0<a href=\"http://www.kiwangadoctors.com/\">Kiwanga Doctors</a>. The following day I went into their offices ready for redemption.</p>\n\n<p>I was attended to and later went back home. After two days my younger brother called me saying he wanted us to meet and end this sin for once. We met where he apologized plus my wife really wailed for an apology. From that day my wife has never repeated since I had improved my romantic game since I was given sweetening oils which really have played important role in ensuring that I remain romantic each day. We are now living happily with my wife as that love was once restored.</p>\n\n<p><a href=\"http://www.kiwangadoctors.com/\">Kiwanga Doctors</a>\u00a0solve marriage problems, winning court cases, lotteries just to mention a few. They also cast hex spells. Black magic spells just within the span of three days and everything will be in order.
