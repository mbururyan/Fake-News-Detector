linked to a 21-year-old Nairobi Technical Institute student and an associate has been frozen over suspicion that it is proceeds of crime, bringing the total amount blocked to Sh210 million.\n\nHigh Court judge Esther Maina ordered the freezing of $631,071 (Sh71.2 million) at Equity Bank #ticker:EQTY and Sh37 million in the same bank in the name of Tebby Wambui Kago.\n\nThe court further allowed the freezing of Sh5 million at Stanbic Bank #ticker:SBIC in Ms Felesta Nyamathira Njoroge\u2019s account, adding to the $914,967 (Sh102 million) frozen last month.\n\nThe money was wired to the two by Ms Njoroge\u2019s Belgian boyfriend Marc De Mesel in August amid suspicions of the source of the millions from the cryptocurrency dealer.\n\nThe Belgian had indicated in the declaration documents that Ms Njoroge was \u201cfree to use the money to secure financial security for our future children\u201d.\n\nDocuments filed in court indicate that Ms Kago is an associate of Ms Njoroge, with both receiving the Sh210 million in eight batches over a period of two weeks.\n\nTuesday, the Assets Recovery Agency (ARA) told the court that investigations established that the suspect funds were received from the same source, Mr De Mesel, and distributed in the same manner, to various accounts belonging to the two women.\n\n\u201cThe pattern of transaction in the accounts in issue and the activities of one De Mesel Marc and the Respondents depicts money laundering activities and this Honourable Court ought to issue the orders sought,\u201d the agency said.\n\nThe agency said the Belgian wired a total of $909,900 between August 6 and 10 to Ms Kago\u2019s dollar account.\n\nIn September, Ms Kago distributed a total of $278,799 to several accounts, including hers and another one registered in the name of Sarah Njoki.\n\n\u201cA preliminary analysis of the bank statement for account number *** held at Equity Bank Limited in the name of the 1st Respondent has established that the account received a cumulative sum of KES 37,000,000 in one single suspicious transaction in the month of November 2021,\u201d the ARA said.\n\nThe court further heard that Ms Njoroge received Sh5 million through inward swift payment on September 22.\n\n\u201cThere are reasonable grounds to suspect that the funds held in the above accounts are proceeds of crime acquired through illicit and money laundering scheme designed to conceal, disguise the nature, source location and movement of the funds,\u201d the ARA said.\n\nThe previous freeze order was to last three months.\n\nMs Njoroge later challenged the order saying there was nothing linking the money to illegal dealings. The agency opposed the application to lift the order, arguing Ms Njoroge must demonstrate that she had suffered or would suffer hardship, if the money remained frozen.\n\n\u201cThe funds in issue are presumed to be proceeds of crime and the applicant is not entitled to utilize the same pending the filing and determination of forfeiture application,\u201d the agency said in the application.\n\nDocuments filed in court showed that the Belgian wired $ 229,980 on August 4, followed by 231,980 the following day. On August 6, he wired the money twice -- $224,980 and $227,980.\n\nMs Njoroge, however, says the application by the ARA is speculative and against her economic rights and that courts should not be used to assist the agency to interfere with her rights.\n\n\u201cThe Respondent obtained sweeping and radical orders against me without making any material disclosure as to whether financial due process was not adhered to in the transfer of the funds to me,\u201d she said.", "articleBodyHtml": "<article>\n\n<figure><img src=\"data:image/png;base64,iVBORw0KGgoAAAANSUhEUgAAAAEAAAABCAQAAAC1HAwCAAAAC0lEQVR42mNkYAAAAAYAAjCB0C8AAAAASUVORK5CYII=\" alt=\"money\" title=\"\" data-cm-responsive-media='[{\"name\":\"landscape_ratio16x9\",\"ratioWidth\":16,\"ratioHeight\":9,\"linksForWidth\":{\"200\":\"/resource/image/3653208/landscape_ratio16x9/200/112/850746676830f54521eee5288182e2e2/Zg/money.jpg\",\"300\":\"/resource/image/3653208/landscape_ratio16x9/300/168/850746676830f54521eee5288182e2e2/vE/money.jpg\",\"400\":\"/resource/image/3653208/landscape_ratio16x9/400/225/850746676830f54521eee5288182e2e2/ST/money.jpg\",\"1160\":\"/resource/image/3653208/landscape_ratio16x9/1160/652/850746676830f54521eee5288182e2e2/Bv/money.jpg\"}},{\"name\":\"portrait_ratio2x3\",\"ratioWidth\":2,\"ratioHeight\":3,\"linksForWidth\":{\"200\":\"/resource/image/3653208/portrait_ratio2x3/200/300/d5de66836e11bb9e547c5c7d09ba72c/dC/money.jpg\",\"400\":\"/resource/image/3653208/portrait_ratio2x3/400/600/d5de66836e11bb9e547c5c7d09ba72c/vf/money.jpg\",\"768\":\"/resource/image/3653208/portrait_ratio2x3/768/1152/d5de66836e11bb9e547c5c7d09ba72c/aX/money.jpg\"}},{\"name\":\"landscape_ratio2x1\",\"ratioWidth\":2,\"ratioHeight\":1,\"linksForWidth\":{\"200\":\"/resource/image/3653208/landscape_ratio2x1/200/100/2a5f295c598cf59ba2baaaf204735411/Lf/money.jpg\"}},{\"name\":\"landscape_ratio3x2\",\"ratioWidth\":3,\"ratioHeight\":2,\"linksForWidth\":{\"300\":\"/resource/image/3653208/landscape_ratio3x2/300/200/34c234126ac26296515172ab35cabc8f/Im/money.jpg\",\"400\":\"/resource/image/3653208/landscape_ratio3x2/400/267/34c234126ac26296515172ab35cabc8f/DY/money.jpg\",\"768\":\"/resource/image/3653208/landscape_ratio3x2/768/512/34c234126ac26296515172ab35cabc8f/Na/money.jpg\"}},{\"name\":\"portrait_ratio1x1\",\"ratioWidth\":1,\"ratioHeight\":1,\"linksForWidth\":{\"50\":\"/resource/image/3653208/portrait_ratio1x1/50/50/3c125295063b7e0f61715f794c3c4b89/mE/money.jpg\",\"60\":\"/resource/image/3653208/portrait_ratio1x1/60/60/3c125295063b7e0f61715f794c3c4b89/Dh/money.jpg\",\"200\":\"/resource/image/3653208/portrait_ratio1x1/200/200/3c125295063b7e0f61715f794c3c4b89/wZ/money.jpg\",\"400\":\"/resource/image/3653208/portrait_ratio1x1/400/400/3c125295063b7e0f61715f794c3c4b89/Tv/money.jpg\",\"768\":\"/resource/image/3653208/portrait_ratio1x1/768/768/3c125295063b7e0f61715f794c3c4b89/ws/money.jpg\"}},{\"name\":\"landscape_ratio4x3\",\"ratioWidth\":4,\"ratioHeight\":3,\"linksForWidth\":{\"200\":\"/resource/image/3653208/landscape_ratio4x3/200/150/50b344d0c9513b3a9d730a673e0f5670/XV/money.jpg\",\"400\":\"/resource/image/3653208/landscape_ratio4x3/400/300/50b344d0c9513b3a9d730a673e0f5670/pc/money.jpg\",\"768\":\"/resource/image/3653208/landscape_ratio4x3/768/576/50b344d0c9513b3a9d730a673e0f5670/Go/money.jpg\"}}]'>\n\n<figcaption><p>Frozen money concept.

On August 6, he wired the money twice -- $224,980 and $227,980.</p>\n\n<p>Ms Njoroge, however, says the application by the ARA is speculative and against her economic rights and that courts should not be used to assist the agency to interfere with her rights.</p>\n\n<p>\u201cThe Respondent obtained sweeping and radical orders against me without making any material disclosure as to whether financial due process was not adhered to in the transfer of the funds to me,\u201d she said.</p>\n\n</article>", "canonicalUrl": "https://www.businessdailyafrica.com/bd/news/another-sh113m-sent-to-student-boyfriend-frozen-3653206"},{"url": "https://www.businessdailyafrica.com/bd/economy/99pc-of-defaulters-profit-uhuru-s-crb-freeze-3651934", "probability": 0.98195904, "headline": "99pc of defaulters profit from Uhuru\u2019s CRB freeze", "datePublished": "2021-12-14T03:00:00+00:00", "datePublishedRaw": "2021-12-14T03:00:00Z", "dateModified": "2021-12-13T17:52:29+00:00", "dateModifiedRaw": "2021-12-13T17:52:29Z", "author": "OTIATO GUGUYU", "authorsList": ["OTIATO GUGUYU"], "inLanguage": "en", "breadcrumbs": [{"name": "Home", "link": "https://www.businessdailyafrica.com/bd"}, {"name": "Economy", "link": "https://www.businessdailyafrica.com/bd/economy"}], "mainImage": "https://www.businessdailyafrica.com/resource/blob/3651938/9fa01038d297e05fe0fdda1979a5eab4/loan-data.jpg", "description": "\nClose to 99 percent of the 4.6 million loan accounts negatively listed with the country\u2019s CRBs will have their data frozen following the suspension of reporting of defaults on Sh5 million and below.", "articleBody": "Economy\n\nClose to 99 percent of the 4.6 million loan accounts negatively listed with the country\u2019s credit reference bureaus (CRBs) will have their data frozen following the suspension of reporting of defaults on Sh5 million and below.\n\nData from the CRBs show that the CRBs can only share default data from less than 50,000 loan accounts.\n\nPresident Uhuru Kenyatta in September announced the moratorium on negative listing of borrowers with loans below Sh5 million with CRBs for a year, cutting credit information sharing in the banking sector.\n\nThe Central Bank of Kenya (CBK) has warned that commercial banks could restart rationing loans following the suspension of blacklisting of such defaulters.\n\nThe suspension is part of the measures to cushion borrowers hit by the Covid-19 pandemic.\n\nIt restricts banks from using defaulters\u2019 data to deny millions of Kenyans additional loans to grow their businesses or for projects.\n\n\u201cWhat this means is that the removal of non-performing data of less than Sh5 million will affect 99 per cent of the non-performing base,\u201d said Joseph Nyaga, the CEO TransUnion, in reference to President Kenyatta\u2019s order.\n\nTransUnion is one of Kenya\u2019s three CRBs.\n\nMr Nyaga said the majority of the negative listings were for loans tapped through mobile phones.\n\nA third of Kenyan loan accounts are negatively listed as defaulted with the CRBs in an economy where Covid-induced job cuts and business closures have pushed thousands of people into a debt trap.\n\nData from the CRBs show that the accounts negatively listed stood at 4.6 million out of the 15 million accounts, reflecting a jump from 3.2 million accounts in April last year.\n\nWorkers and businesses defaulted on bank loans worth Sh93 billion in the year to February following the imposition of stringent measures to contain the spread of the coronavirus.\n\nData from the Central Bank of Kenya (CBK) shows that non-performing loans (NPLs) rose from Sh351 billion in February 2020 to Sh444 billion at the end of February this year \u2014 the sharpest one-year increase in recent history.\n\nBut this excludes defaults from unregulated digital mobile lenders, who were also barred from forwarding the names of loan defaulters to CRBs.\n\nIndustries and other businesses had cut down on their activities in response to the infectious disease, leading to job cuts and unpaid leave for retained staff as profitable firms moved into losses.\n\nThis saw workers who had tapped mortgages and unsecured loans for purchase of goods such as furniture and cars and expenses like school fees default.

These are not cheap,\u201d she said.\n\nSpeaking at a breakfast meeting for media managers and practitioners at Serena hotel on Tuesday, Dr Nyangasi said a majority of cancer patients seek treatment when the disease has spread all over the body, making it expensive to treat.\n\n\u201cThe implication of 70 percent of cancer patients being at stages three and four is that most of them fear they will die due to the cost involved.\n\n\u201cHad the same be noticed at stages one or two, a simple surgery that costs less than Sh100,000 would have helped,\u201d she said.\n\nDr Nyangasi, who also chairs the National Cancer Task Force, said the disease has become the fastest route to poverty due to the expenses involved.\n\nA report released by the World Health Organisation on Monday says an estimated 400,000 children and adolescents of up to 19 years develop cancer every year.\n\n\u201cMany studies have sought to identify the causes of childhood cancer, but very few cancers in children are caused by environmental or lifestyle factors. Cancer prevention efforts in children should focus on behaviours that will prevent the child from developing preventable cancer as an adult,\u201d says the report.\n\nOn Tuesday, Dr Nyangasi urged parents and adults to observe some signs that are common for cancer.

These are not cheap,\u201d she said.</p>\n\n<p>Speaking at a breakfast meeting for media managers and practitioners at Serena hotel on Tuesday, Dr Nyangasi said a majority of cancer patients seek treatment when the disease has spread all over the body, making it expensive to treat.</p>\n\n<p>\u201cThe implication of 70 percent of cancer patients being at stages three and four is that most of them fear they will die due to the cost involved.</p>\n\n<p>\u201cHad the same be noticed at stages one or two, a simple surgery that costs less than Sh100,000 would have helped,\u201d she said.</p>\n\n<p>Dr Nyangasi, who also chairs the National Cancer Task Force, said the disease has become the fastest route to poverty due to the expenses involved.</p>\n\n<p>A report released by the World Health Organisation on Monday says an estimated 400,000 children and adolescents of up to 19 years develop cancer every year.</p>\n\n<p>\u201cMany studies have sought to identify the causes of childhood cancer, but very few cancers in children are caused by environmental or lifestyle factors.

Employers are ripping up the rule book on how, where and when people work and experimenting with something called \u2018hybrid working\u2019. It\u2019s a change that is gathering momentum. A recent survey found 75% of workers believe that \u2018hybrid work\u2019 will be standard in their companies within three years.\n\nSo if hybrid is the future of work, what will the hybrid office look like?\n\nWhat is hybrid work? Hybrid working is an amorphous term. Depending on the organization, it may mean workers coming in most days, a couple of days per week or only meeting once a quarter. In some companies, it will be a combination of all of those, tailored to individuals.\n\nHybrid working started long before the pandemic, with flexible working and teleworking gaining popularity first with the emergence of personal computers in the 1970s and then with the internet in the 1990s.\n\nHowever, at the beginning of 2020, still, only 5% of work hours in America were spent at home. By spring 2020 this had risen to 60%. As of October 2021, that figure was still at 40%.\n\nSimilar trends have played out across the world. Millions of people who had never had the opportunity or inclination to work remotely were experiencing a different model, and many found they could work as effectively from home.\n\nOffices seemed not as essential as we thought, and as companies like Twitter started to make announcements that staff could work from home forever, the reason for having them at all started to be called into question.\n\nThe office: flawed even before hybrid work Pre-pandemic offices had become increasingly disliked. In one pre-pandemic survey, 85% of people said they were dissatisfied with their office environment. Whether in attempts to improve collaboration or reduce costs, offices had become increasingly open plan and higher density, sometimes less than 5m2 per person.\n\nConsequently, they were often noisy, distracting and unhealthy. Also, 40% of office staff suffer from poor lighting and the temperature was typically not only uncomfortable but also impeded the performance of women.\n\nAt home, people can control their noise level, lighting, temperature and privacy and optimize the environment for comfort and productivity. Little wonder that 50% of workers in the U.S. (and 35% in UK) say they would take a pay cut to continue to work remotely at least part-time post-pandemic and 25% would quit if they can\u2019t.\n\nHowever, there is one category of staff that thinks very differently. A study across six countries shows that 44% of senior executives want to get back to the office full time compared to 17% of their staff.\n\nIs the office dead? Unlikely So what is the case for returning to the office? In the 1980\u2019s an MIT professor Thomas Allen discovered the power of proximity. He found that most collaboration happens within an 8m radius and drops to almost zero by 50m.\n\nThe Allen Curve, which still holds true today with people emailing colleagues most of who they sit closest to. This proximity becomes even more critical for new recruits and new projects, where the learning curve is steepest. Proximity also reinforces culture and a shared sense of belonging.\n\nResearch by Microsoft shows that remote work led employees to spend less time collaborating with colleagues outside their regular network, so-called \u2018weak ties\u2019, and people in other functional units. Collaborating with new people often leads to new knowledge and increased innovation. Steve Jobs said it: \u201ccreativity comes from spontaneous meetings, from random discussions.\u201d\n\nSo what does a hybrid office look like? Hybrid working provides a compromise that potentially everyone can accept.

Employers are ripping up the rule book on how, where and when people work and experimenting with something called \u2018hybrid working\u2019. It\u2019s a change that is gathering momentum. A recent survey found 75% of workers believe that \u2018hybrid work\u2019 will be standard in their companies within three years.</p>\n\n<p>So if hybrid is the future of work, what will the hybrid office look like?</p>\n\n<p>What is hybrid work? Hybrid working is an amorphous term. Depending on the organization, it may mean workers coming in most days, a couple of days per week or only meeting once a quarter. In some companies, it will be a combination of all of those, tailored to individuals.</p>\n\n<p>Hybrid working started long before the pandemic, with flexible working and teleworking gaining popularity first with the emergence of personal computers in the 1970s and then with the internet in the 1990s.</p>\n\n<p>However, at the beginning of 2020, still, only 5% of work hours in America were spent at home. By spring 2020 this had risen to 60%. As of October 2021, that figure was still at 40%.</p>\n\n<p>Similar trends have played out across the world. Millions of people who had never had the opportunity or inclination to work remotely were experiencing a different model, and many found they could work as effectively from home.</p>\n\n<p>Offices seemed not as essential as we thought, and as companies like Twitter started to make announcements that staff could work from home forever, the reason for having them at all started to be called into question.</p>\n\n<p>The office: flawed even before hybrid work Pre-pandemic offices had become increasingly disliked. In one pre-pandemic survey, 85% of people said they were dissatisfied with their office environment. Whether in attempts to improve collaboration or reduce costs, offices had become increasingly open plan and higher density, sometimes less than 5m2 per person.</p>\n\n<p>Consequently, they were often noisy, distracting and unhealthy. Also, 40% of office staff suffer from poor lighting and the temperature was typically not only uncomfortable but also impeded the performance of women.</p>\n\n<p>At home, people can control their noise level, lighting, temperature and privacy and optimize the environment for comfort and productivity. Little wonder that 50% of workers in the U.S. (and 35% in UK) say they would take a pay cut to continue to work remotely at least part-time post-pandemic and 25% would quit if they can\u2019t.</p>\n\n<p>However, there is one category of staff that thinks very differently. A study across six countries shows that 44% of senior executives want to get back to the office full time compared to 17% of their staff.</p>\n\n<p>Is the office dead? Unlikely So what is the case for returning to the office? In the 1980\u2019s an MIT professor Thomas Allen discovered the power of proximity. He found that most collaboration happens within an 8m radius and drops to almost zero by 50m.</p>\n\n<p>The Allen Curve, which still holds true today with people emailing colleagues most of who they sit closest to. This proximity becomes even more critical for new recruits and new projects, where the learning curve is steepest. Proximity also reinforces culture and a shared sense of belonging.</p>\n\n<p>Research by Microsoft shows that remote work led employees to spend less time collaborating with colleagues outside their regular network, so-called \u2018weak ties\u2019, and people in other functional units. Collaborating with new people often leads to new knowledge and increased innovation. Steve Jobs said it: \u201ccreativity comes from spontaneous meetings, from random discussions.\u201d</p>\n\n<p>So what does a hybrid office look like? Hybrid working provides a compromise that potentially everyone can accept. It allows staff the opportunity to carry out individual heads-down work at home if they feel they can concentrate better there and it provides collaboration-focused office space to ensure connection, knowledge sharing, and unplanned encounters.</p>\n\n<p>For hybrid working to be successful though the office needs to change dramatically.</p>\n\n<p>There needs to be a shift away from rows of identical desks squeezed together to more varied, flexible and individually controllable environments that suit all workers and work styles. There still will need to be enough places for individuals to effectively concentrate and focus between meetings and for those who can\u2019t or don\u2019t wish to work at home.</p>\n\n<p>There may be quiet rooms, bookable desks, or touchdown spaces, ideally with individual control over lighting, temperature and acoustics.</p>\n\n<p>However, most hybrid offices will be set up for a smorgasbord of collaboration - planned and spontaneous, open and private, from one to one to the whole office, internal and client, face to face and with remote staff, for mentoring, brainstorming, presentations and training.</p>\n\n<p>The lines will blur between work and play. Enhanced amenity and social facilities, like cafes, bars, fitness facilities are not only key to enticing staff to the office but can also strengthen a sense of belonging and shared culture, and encourage cross-functional connections and chance encounters.</p>\n\n<p>The one size fits all approach to workplaces that became the norm in offices across the world will not work for the hybrid office.

The PPP Directorate as envisaged has a far broader mandate than before when it was a Unit. It will originate, guide and coordinate the selection, ranking and prioritisation of PPP projects within the public framework.\n\nIt has also been given a proactive licence to originate and lead in project structuring and PPP programmes in Kenya. The PPP Act, 2021 centralises certain approvals in the PPP process within the PPP Committee but pushes others down to the PPP Directorate.\n\nFor example, the PPP Committee takes over some oversight functions from the Debt Management Office, and the final approval for a contracting authority to enter into a PPP agreement now rests with the PPP Committee rather than at the government or parliamentary level.\n\nAdditional consistency in who gives approvals, more appropriate levels for approvals and the addition of timelines will offer greater clarity for investors and should create a more efficient process for PPP development.\n\nFurthermore, by reducing the direct role of the government in PPPs by removing the Cabinet's approval function, projects are for lack of a better word de-politicised and are less susceptible to being derailed to meet competing political objectives.\n\nThe PPP Act, 2021 also adds a number of permissible contract structures, including some that are not traditionally considered PPPs such as public-private joint ventures and strategic partnerships. The net effect of these changes is to broaden the scope of what is classed as a PPP, funnelling more contracting arrangements between the public and private sectors.\n\nThe PPP Act, 2021 proposes a significant expansion of the procurement options available to a contracting authority. Clear timelines have been stipulated for certain processes, including the period within which bids must be evaluated and for appeals by bidders.\n\nFor instance, the PPP Act, 2021 also introduces Direct Procurement but reserves this method for exceptional circumstances.

The PPP Directorate as envisaged has a far broader mandate than before when it was a Unit. It will originate, guide and coordinate the selection, ranking and prioritisation of PPP projects within the public framework.</p>\n\n<p>It has also been given a proactive licence to originate and lead in project structuring and PPP programmes in Kenya. The PPP Act, 2021 centralises certain approvals in the PPP process within the PPP Committee but pushes others down to the PPP Directorate.</p>\n\n<p>For example, the PPP Committee takes over some oversight functions from the Debt Management Office, and the final approval for a contracting authority to enter into a PPP agreement now rests with the PPP Committee rather than at the government or parliamentary level.</p>\n\n<p>Additional consistency in who gives approvals, more appropriate levels for approvals and the addition of timelines will offer greater clarity for investors and should create a more efficient process for PPP development.</p>\n\n<p>Furthermore, by reducing the direct role of the government in PPPs by removing the Cabinet's approval function, projects are for lack of a better word de-politicised and are less susceptible to being derailed to meet competing political objectives.</p>\n\n<p>The PPP Act, 2021 also adds a number of permissible contract structures, including some that are not traditionally considered PPPs such as public-private joint ventures and strategic partnerships. The net effect of these changes is to broaden the scope of what is classed as a PPP, funnelling more contracting arrangements between the public and private sectors.</p>\n\n<p>The PPP Act, 2021 proposes a significant expansion of the procurement options available to a contracting authority. Clear timelines have been stipulated for certain processes, including the period within which bids must be evaluated and for appeals by bidders.</p>\n\n<p>For instance, the PPP Act, 2021 also introduces Direct Procurement but reserves this method for exceptional circumstances. These include where the works or services are only available from a limited number of private parties and where direct procurement shall significantly lower the cost of delivering the project etc.</p>\n\n<h2>Privately Initiated Investment Proposals (PIIPs)</h2>\n\n<p>The PIIP process was one of the more problematic aspects under the now-repealed PPP Act, 2013.

But perhaps amongst the most bewildering, these days, is the mish-mash that is our approach to resources.\n\nOn the one hand, Kenya is so green. We have moved our electricity production to renewable resources, from hydro to geothermal, wind and even a little solar. It always surprises me that we don\u2019t do more solar, in fact, sat right on the equator as we are and with more sunlight than almost anywhere.\n\nBut, with or without solar, we now run majorly on \u2018sustainable\u2019 energy.\n\nAnd there is the word: the \u2018sustainable\u2019 word. Meaning we can carry on running our lights and our phones from our main-grid wind-powered, geothermal-powered, water-powered electricity maybe forever, and we aren\u2019t depleting the wind or the earth\u2019s warmth.\n\nWe also have the toughest laws on plastic bags in the world, as far as I know, with that hefty fine for even owning a plastic bag, to ensure we don\u2019t use them and then they don\u2019t go into our rivers, sea, and landfill and exist still in a hundred years\u2019 time, for our children\u2019s children\u2019s children\u2019s children\u2019s children to clear up or live around.\n\nPlastic bags, it turned out, were not sustainable. We couldn\u2019t just keep on making them and stacking the unused ones up to last nearly forever.\n\nWe even have a sharp eye out, increasingly, for our rain forests, in our water-scarce nation, evicting squatters from water towers, banning charcoal making that reduces our tree cover, setting targets for reforestation: alert now to the way forests capture water into our water table and generate springs, rivers, lakes and the water for all our boreholes.\n\nAnd yet we sit with one truly massive area of unsustainability that we dare not speak. For many of our people run livelihoods that are literally the antithesis of sustainability.\n\nSo no one will say it, but let me: pastoralist populations in our northern counties have nearly doubled in the last decade. The livestock they own has grown faster still. But the model of pastoralism nowhere looks after or cultivates resources: the principle is to move in, eat until it\u2019s all eaten, move onto somewhere else and eat all.\n\nNow that was perfect for a slender population that could then allow the over-grazed pasture to \u2018regenerate\u2019, which, as a matter of fact, takes years. But our northern lands have seen swathes of pasture lost to invasive species, both indigenous and alien (from Asia, western Africa, or South America).\n\nTemperatures have risen and droughts have become more frequent and more prolonged \u2013 partly as a result of climate change, but also partly because of the now comprehensive and widespread overgrazing and destruction of water towers.\n\nMuch of our north, indeed, is becoming desertified, in a horrible drift from semi-arid to arid, of our own \u2018unsustainable\u2019 making. And then, we of Nairobi and the centre and the west and the coast with our rich farms and our sense of distance look on and say, \u2018oh look at those pastoralists and how they fight over land, but they always do it, so there it is\u2019, as our nation steadily, incrementally, and sometimes irretrievably turns into desert.\n\nAnd never let us speak the words that acknowledge, \u2018beyond banning charcoal, we really need to open a huge national discourse about what we can do to create sustainable pastoralism\u2019.\n\nFor even our farms and hydropower won\u2019t go far once the land to the north is fully desertified, and once those hundreds of thousands of cattle have all fully eaten their way down to and through the road verges of our capital city.\n\nDo we cap cattle ownership? Do we find and develop new and different income options? What\u2019s our responsible grazing policy? Where\u2019s the sustainability we can build in before our north is a civil war and millions are suffering from no way back?\n\nSustainability means balancing our present consumption against our future consumption. It means not over-fishing, not over-grazing, and managing our resources, all of us, and not everyone except those it\u2019s socially unacceptable to say need to manage resources too. Without sustainability, we get destroyed, and that feeds no one at all.", "articleBodyHtml": "<article>\n\n<h2><a href=\"https://www.businessdailyafrica.com/bd/opinion-analysis/columnists\" title=\"Columnists\">Columnists</a></h2>\n\n<figure><img src=\"data:image/png;base64,iVBORw0KGgoAAAANSUhEUgAAAAEAAAABCAQAAAC1HAwCAAAAC0lEQVR42mNkYAAAAAYAAjCB0C8AAAAASUVORK5CYII=\" alt=\"pastr\" title=\"\" data-cm-responsive-media='[{\"name\":\"landscape_ratio16x9\",\"ratioWidth\":16,\"ratioHeight\":9,\"linksForWidth\":{\"200\":\"/resource/image/3652978/landscape_ratio16x9/200/112/29ebfe109707cc909a3004f85fd4abe2/Ft/pastr.jpg\",\"300\":\"/resource/image/3652978/landscape_ratio16x9/300/168/29ebfe109707cc909a3004f85fd4abe2/VJ/pastr.jpg\",\"400\":\"/resource/image/3652978/landscape_ratio16x9/400/225/29ebfe109707cc909a3004f85fd4abe2/SQ/pastr.jpg\",\"1160\":\"/resource/image/3652978/landscape_ratio16x9/1160/652/29ebfe109707cc909a3004f85fd4abe2/mY/pastr.jpg\"}},{\"name\":\"portrait_ratio2x3\",\"ratioWidth\":2,\"ratioHeight\":3,\"linksForWidth\":{\"200\":\"/resource/image/3652978/portrait_ratio2x3/200/300/edbb2fe763639f2bcbe020070520c974/Hq/pastr.jpg\",\"400\":\"/resource/image/3652978/portrait_ratio2x3/400/600/edbb2fe763639f2bcbe020070520c974/Pv/pastr.jpg\",\"768\":\"/resource/image/3652978/portrait_ratio2x3/768/1152/edbb2fe763639f2bcbe020070520c974/jj/pastr.jpg\"}},{\"name\":\"landscape_ratio2x1\",\"ratioWidth\":2,\"ratioHeight\":1,\"linksForWidth\":{\"200\":\"/resource/image/3652978/landscape_ratio2x1/200/100/6d583d2c440a2f599bd3781d51719f1a/Mo/pastr.jpg\"}},{\"name\":\"landscape_ratio3x2\",\"ratioWidth\":3,\"ratioHeight\":2,\"linksForWidth\":{\"300\":\"/resource/image/3652978/landscape_ratio3x2/300/200/e600722d8405471c4fa7cde07fe1e2b9/Ca/pastr.jpg\",\"400\":\"/resource/image/3652978/landscape_ratio3x2/400/267/e600722d8405471c4fa7cde07fe1e2b9/iY/pastr.jpg\",\"768\":\"/resource/image/3652978/landscape_ratio3x2/768/512/e600722d8405471c4fa7cde07fe1e2b9/ey/pastr.jpg\"}},{\"name\":\"portrait_ratio1x1\",\"ratioWidth\":1,\"ratioHeight\":1,\"linksForWidth\":{\"50\":\"/resource/image/3652978/portrait_ratio1x1/50/50/d8c0237ac5b573ba17070934ccfc136b/ac/pastr.jpg\",\"60\":\"/resource/image/3652978/portrait_ratio1x1/60/60/d8c0237ac5b573ba17070934ccfc136b/iN/pastr.jpg\",\"200\":\"/resource/image/3652978/portrait_ratio1x1/200/200/d8c0237ac5b573ba17070934ccfc136b/Sp/pastr.jpg\",\"400\":\"/resource/image/3652978/portrait_ratio1x1/400/400/d8c0237ac5b573ba17070934ccfc136b/mr/pastr.jpg\",\"768\":\"/resource/image/3652978/portrait_ratio1x1/768/768/d8c0237ac5b573ba17070934ccfc136b/EU/pastr.jpg\"}},{\"name\":\"landscape_ratio4x3\",\"ratioWidth\":4,\"ratioHeight\":3,\"linksForWidth\":{\"200\":\"/resource/image/3652978/landscape_ratio4x3/200/150/183664112dab785f1fb6425eacc8bbd8/aB/pastr.jpg\",\"400\":\"/resource/image/3652978/landscape_ratio4x3/400/300/183664112dab785f1fb6425eacc8bbd8/YY/pastr.jpg\",\"768\":\"/resource/image/3652978/landscape_ratio4x3/768/576/183664112dab785f1fb6425eacc8bbd8/hU/pastr.jpg\"}}]'>\n\n<figcaption><p>Young herders from the indigenous Samburu pastoral community herd their family cattle on January 24, 2017.

After a new treatment regime, symptoms of the disease would lessen, only to reappear again with a higher intensity,\u201d she recalls.\n\nThis antibiotic resistance problem has been linked to many causes. They include the overuse or misuse of antibiotics (such as taking antibiotics for viral infections like a cold or flu), failure to complete drug doses and the reliance on low-quality or substandard drugs.\n\nAside from these usual \u2018culprits\u2019, new research shows that infant formula milk could be a major contributor to this challenge too.\n\nThe novel study, which was published in The American Journal of Clinical Nutrition, indicates that infant formula is associated with an approximately 70 percent higher occurrence of genes associated with antibiotic resistance in the gut of newborns.\n\nThe research was carried out at the University of Helsinki. It went further to demonstrate that breastfeeding newborns is associated with a reduced spread of antibiotic-resistant bugs among infants.\n\nThis thereby lessens their risk of suffering from drug-resistant infections that are difficult to treat.\n\n\u201cWe obtained evidence in this study showing that bacterial genes which confer resistance can already be found in abundance in the gut of newborns and infants even before they are exposed to antibiotics. And feeding infants with formula significantly affects the number of these antibiotic-resistant bacteria,\u201d noted the Finnish and American researchers that jointly worked on the study.\n\nDuring the study, the researchers analysed the microorganisms in the gut of more than 600 newborns.\n\nBased on the results of the study, the diet of newborns was found to be the primary factor influencing the number of resistant bugs present in the guts of the babies assessed.\n\nIndeed, a considerably higher abundance of resistance genes was seen in children whose diet consisted fully or partially of infant formula, compared to children who were exclusively breastfed or who consumed donated breastmilk.\n\n\u201cThe effect of infant formula exposure was markedly more significant than that of antibiotic treatments given to the mother or infant, as well as other factors that usually affect the composition of microorganisms in the gut of babies such as the mode of delivery, the duration of the pregnancy or the infant\u2019s age,\u201d says Dr Katariina P\u00e4rn\u00e4nen, one of the study authors from the University of Helsinki.\n\nBased on past studies, the researchers note that the protective effect of breastmilk against antibiotic resistance is due to the fact that consuming it solely increases the number of useful bugs (known as bifidobacterial) in the baby\u2019s gut which goes a long way in boosting immunity and improving infant health.\n\nIn contrast, infants fed entirely or partially with formula were found to have more harmful bacteria (of the Enterobacteriaceae family) and other potential disease-causing bugs in their intestines. This provides a conducive environment for the multiplication and spread of resistant bacteria in their gut.\n\nAccording to Dr P\u00e4rn\u00e4nen, these findings shed more light on the health effects of breastmilk, which should therefore be encouraged, as per the World Health Organisation (WHO) guidelines.\n\n\u201cBreastmilk is the primary source of nutrition for all infants, and its health benefits are of particular importance to premature infants. The new findings indicate that breastfeeding premature and newborn infants also reduces the proliferation of bacteria that is resistant to antibiotics in the gut of infants. This potentially reduces the risk of difficult infections, which I consider a particularly important find due to the ever-increasing prevalence of antibiotic resistance,\u201d she says.\n\nSome scientists specialising in antibiotic resistance believe that the problem will continue to gain in prevalence even if the use of antibiotics were to be radically curtailed.\n\nConsequently, the researchers note that measures not based on reducing antibiotic use can be particularly useful in the fight against superbugs.\n\n\u201cAnd breastmilk may therefore turn out to be an exceedingly effective weapon for addressing the antibiotic-resistant problem and protecting premature infants and newborns,\u201d they note.\n\nAccording to the WHO, women are encouraged to exclusively breastfeed their children for the first six months of their life and thereafter complement the milk with additional foods until the baby is two years old.\n\nDuring the initial six months after delivery, milk is considered the ideal food for infants. It is safe, clean and contains antibodies, which help protect against many common childhood illnesses. It also contains sufficient nutrients required for the effective development of children during that period.\n\nBeyond that, the milk continues to provide up to 50 percent or more of children\u2019s nutritional needs until they are a year old.

This was after a span of about 40 years since my first visit to the country as our honeymoon destination when I was a young diplomat who had just started to explore his career passion.\n\nI am now concluding my tenure as the Japanese Ambassador to Kenya at the end of this year. This also wraps up my 43-year diplomatic career. Lucky me, my career as a diplomat was decorated with African elements.\n\nMy diplomatic debut was in Nigeria in 1982. Thereafter I was continuously involved with Africa Affairs at headquarters and later came back to this beautiful and mystical continent in 2012 as the Japanese Ambassador to Sudan.\n\nIt is a great honour for me to have my finale here in Kenya, the most important country for Japan in Africa. Kenya has been enjoying her position as one of the closest partners of Japan for the past decades.\n\nIn this restive region, it is remarkable that Kenya has successfully achieved political transitions through democratic elections since her independence.\n\nPeace and stability\n\nPeace and stability achieved through democratic principles are what Japan always emphasises when we refer to Kenya\u2019s values. It constituted the exact reason that Japan supported Kenya\u2019s candidature for membership of the United Nations Security Council in 2019.\n\nNow, President Uhuru Kenyatta has proudly validated our trust and expectations by successfully navigating global and regional conundrums as an important member of the UNSC over this year.\n\nTICAD 6 in 2016 was another case to describe Japan\u2019s high expectations for this promising East African country. Kenya was the first country to hold the TICAD conference outside our home country in its long history since 1993.\n\nThe TICAD 6 co-hosted by Japan and Kenya in 2016 surely conveyed to the global community the significance of African ownership and the rich potential through robust partnership between us.\n\nIt was also at TICAD 6 where Japan first announced the \u201cFree and Open Indo-Pacific\u201d initiative, which is now being promoted not only by Japan but the G7 countries and other like-minded countries as well. This was not a coincidence, of course.\n\nWe intentionally chose Kenya as a place to launch this crucial policy for global peace and prosperity, as the country provides a gateway to East and Central Africa, with an abundant young population full of potential.\n\nKenya has been the biggest beneficiary of Japan\u2019s Official Development Assistance in sub-Saharan Africa. I have signed more than Sh100 billion in loans and grants to Kenya in the past two and a half years alone.\n\nThe recent focal point is the port of Mombasa. Japan has been working closely with the Kenyan government and business leaders to add extra attractions to the port by developing a Special Economic Zone, the Dongo-Kundu SEZ.\n\nJapan, a small island country in the Far East, achieved its economic growth and prosperity by actively engaging in maritime trade. Maritime security is our top priority if we are to continuously enjoy peace and prosperity.\n\nBased on this, Japan has extended its assistance and cooperation to the pristine Kenya Coast Guard Services, and our cooperation in the maritime security area is to be explored much further.\n\nThe significance of Kenya is of course not limited to its relations with Japan but is also extended to its impact in regional politics.\n\nCurrently, Kenya holds the presidency of the East African Community and the President in Office of the Organization of African, Pacific and Caribbean States (OACPS), and is also an active member of numerous international organisations. Through all those platforms, Kenya is assertively raising its voice, promoting the values of Africa and the global South.\n\nEver since the end of the Cold War, the continent, especially the East African region is now facing the biggest change in regional balance of power. For African countries that are intertwined with each other in terms of history and people, turmoil in a nation directly affects its neighbours\u2019 security and domestic politics.\n\nKenya, surrounded by restive countries, however, has been standing sound with robust stability in regional politics and showing strong leadership for peace in the region. I sincerely pay my tribute to the positive impact Kenya has had on the region and offer reassurance that Japan will continue to support Kenya\u2019s role and commitment in the region.\n\nAlthough impact-leaning news headlines favour fancy big infrastructure projects, I personally cherish relatively small projects called \u201cGrassroots Grant Projects\u201d supported by our Embassy here in Nairobi, where local people such as schoolchildren or community women groups are the direct beneficiaries.\n\nDuring my tenure, I travelled to around 15 counties to attend handover ceremonies of schools, factories, and clinics and every time I visited the local places, I had opportunities to interact with local people. Among the colorful and region-unique music and dances people showcased while welcoming us, there was one thing common across all of Kenya.\n\nThat was the people\u2019s warm hospitality. Interacting with the warm-hearted people of Kenya and seeing their dedicated efforts to better their lives, I strongly believe that this country has a bright and prosperous future.\n\nSINGING AMBASSADOR\n\nIn the latter half of my tenure, I was delighted to receive the nickname \u201cSinging Ambassador\u201d.

FILE PHOTO | NMG</p></figcaption></figure>\n\n<p>It was in July 2019 that I arrived at Jomo Kenyatta International Airport in the company of my wife. This was after a span of about 40 years since my first visit to the country as our honeymoon destination when I was a young diplomat who had just started to explore his career passion.</p>\n\n<p>I am now concluding my tenure as the Japanese Ambassador to Kenya at the end of this year. This also wraps up my 43-year diplomatic career. Lucky me, my career as a diplomat was decorated with African elements.</p>\n\n<p>My diplomatic debut was in Nigeria in 1982. Thereafter I was continuously involved with Africa Affairs at headquarters and later came back to this beautiful and mystical continent in 2012 as the Japanese Ambassador to Sudan.</p>\n\n<p>It is a great honour for me to have my finale here in Kenya, the most important country for Japan in Africa. Kenya has been enjoying her position as one of the closest partners of Japan for the past decades.</p>\n\n<p>In this restive region, it is remarkable that Kenya has successfully achieved political transitions through democratic elections since her independence.</p>\n\n<h2>Peace and stability</h2>\n\n<p>Peace and stability achieved through democratic principles are what Japan always emphasises when we refer to Kenya\u2019s values. It constituted the exact reason that Japan supported Kenya\u2019s candidature for membership of the United Nations Security Council in 2019.</p>\n\n<p>Now, President Uhuru Kenyatta has proudly validated our trust and expectations by successfully navigating global and regional conundrums as an important member of the UNSC over this year.</p>\n\n<p>TICAD 6 in 2016 was another case to describe Japan\u2019s high expectations for this promising East African country. Kenya was the first country to hold the TICAD conference outside our home country in its long history since 1993.</p>\n\n<p>The TICAD 6 co-hosted by Japan and Kenya in 2016 surely conveyed to the global community the significance of African ownership and the rich potential through robust partnership between us.</p>\n\n<p>It was also at TICAD 6 where Japan first announced the \u201cFree and Open Indo-Pacific\u201d initiative, which is now being promoted not only by Japan but the G7 countries and other like-minded countries as well. This was not a coincidence, of course.</p>\n\n<p>We intentionally chose Kenya as a place to launch this crucial policy for global peace and prosperity, as the country provides a gateway to East and Central Africa, with an abundant young population full of potential.</p>\n\n<p>Kenya has been the biggest beneficiary of Japan\u2019s Official Development Assistance in sub-Saharan Africa. I have signed more than Sh100 billion in loans and grants to Kenya in the past two and a half years alone.</p>\n\n<p>The recent focal point is the port of Mombasa. Japan has been working closely with the Kenyan government and business leaders to add extra attractions to the port by developing a Special Economic Zone, the Dongo-Kundu SEZ.</p>\n\n<p>Japan, a small island country in the Far East, achieved its economic growth and prosperity by actively engaging in maritime trade. Maritime security is our top priority if we are to continuously enjoy peace and prosperity.</p>\n\n<p>Based on this, Japan has extended its assistance and cooperation to the pristine Kenya Coast Guard Services, and our cooperation in the maritime security area is to be explored much further.</p>\n\n<p>The significance of Kenya is of course not limited to its relations with Japan but is also extended to its impact in regional politics.</p>\n\n<p>Currently, Kenya holds the presidency of the East African Community and the President in Office of the Organization of African, Pacific and Caribbean States (OACPS), and is also an active member of numerous international organisations. Through all those platforms, Kenya is assertively raising its voice, promoting the values of Africa and the global South.</p>\n\n<p>Ever since the end of the Cold War, the continent, especially the East African region is now facing the biggest change in regional balance of power. For African countries that are intertwined with each other in terms of history and people, turmoil in a nation directly affects its neighbours\u2019 security and domestic politics.</p>\n\n<p>Kenya, surrounded by restive countries, however, has been standing sound with robust stability in regional politics and showing strong leadership for peace in the region. I sincerely pay my tribute to the positive impact Kenya has had on the region and offer reassurance that Japan will continue to support Kenya\u2019s role and commitment in the region.</p>\n\n<p>Although impact-leaning news headlines favour fancy big infrastructure projects, I personally cherish relatively small projects called \u201cGrassroots Grant Projects\u201d supported by our Embassy here in Nairobi, where local people such as schoolchildren or community women groups are the direct beneficiaries.</p>\n\n<p>During my tenure, I travelled to around 15 counties to attend handover ceremonies of schools, factories, and clinics and every time I visited the local places, I had opportunities to interact with local people. Among the colorful and region-unique music and dances people showcased while welcoming us, there was one thing common across all of Kenya.</p>\n\n<p>That was the people\u2019s warm hospitality. Interacting with the warm-hearted people of Kenya and seeing their dedicated efforts to better their lives, I strongly believe that this country has a bright and prosperous future.</p>\n\n<p>SINGING AMBASSADOR</p>\n\n<p>In the latter half of my tenure, I was delighted to receive the nickname \u201cSinging Ambassador\u201d. This nickname is courtesy of my musical performances at various occasions where my wife and I sang Kiswahili songs.</p>\n\n<p>I like Kiswahili songs in general but one of my favourite is Daima, sung by my good friend, Eric Wainaina. The lyrics, which acknowledge the challenge of building a nation with such a wide variety of ethnic groups and promoting the unity of people, really touch my heart.</p>\n\n<p>My long diplomatic career has taught me the fundamental significance of people-to-people understanding through mutual respect. It was a great pleasure that I could embody this value through music in the interaction with Kenyan people.</p>\n\n</article>", "canonicalUrl": "https://www.businessdailyafrica.com/bd/opinion-analysis/columnists/kenya-rated-highly-japan-africa-relations-3652936"},{"url": "https://www.businessdailyafrica.com/bd/lifestyle/society/think-disruptive-innovation-3651602", "probability": 0.97493714, "headline": "Think disruptive innovation", "datePublished": "2021-12-13T21:00:00+00:00", "datePublishedRaw": "2021-12-13T21:00:00Z", "dateModified": "2021-12-13T13:58:24+00:00", "dateModifiedRaw": "2021-12-13T13:58:24Z", "author": "DAVID J.

For Wittgenstein, the world we see is defined and given meaning by the words we choose. Simply: You create your world in your speaking.\n\nInnovation is a word on everyone\u2019s lips. But how can you innovate? How can a company, NGO, or donor programme create a disruptive innovation that is a genuine game-changer? What can we learn from the genius of [Africa born] Elon Musk?\n\nGuru of innovation, Clayton Christensen, talked about three types of innovation: Sustaining, efficiency and disruptive. Sustaining and efficiency innovations are more incremental, fine-tuning, polishing what exists. Doing the necessary, that every business needs to do to just stay afloat, and remain competitive.\n\nAt the age of 46, Elon Musk had innovated and created three multi-billion dollar companies in different industries: PayPal in financial services, Tesla Motors in automotive, and SpaceX in aerospace. Yes, his work ethic of working 100 hours a week, now cutting back to 85 hours helps.\n\nBut clues of Musk\u2019s success are more about how he thinks about wicked business problems. His approach has deep roots going back to Aristotle, Euclid, Thomas Edison and Nikola Tesla, all of whom identified the missing link to accelerated learning, and just plain thinking [very] differently.\n\nDefault thinking\n\nMost of the businesses' thinking relies on working by analogy, building on what we know, doing some minor tinkering, and building on what has been done.\n\nA prime example of this is the products and services offered by the many Kenyan banks and insurance companies, based on sustaining innovations, all quite similar, often just targeted at a different market segment. Nothing wrong with this \u2018cut and paste\u2019 approach.\n\nBut to create disruptive innovation, a distinct way of thinking, based on reasoning by first principles is required. Take the case of the cook and the chef, while they sound quite similar, there is an important distinction. The cook follows a recipe, working by analogy, if that recipe is lost they are in trouble.\n\nIn contrast, the creative chef understands ingredients, flavours and combinations. She doesn\u2019t follow a recipe, creates from the basics, based on knowledge, rather than know-how.\n\nSo, it\u2019s not about what you think, but how you do about the problem. To be such a disruptive innovating thinker, Musk relied on his training in physics.\n\n\u201cWell, I do think there\u2019s a good framework for thinking. It is physics. You know, the sort of first principles reasoning. Boil things down to their fundamental truths and reason up from there, as opposed to reasoning by analogy. Through most of our life, we get through life by reasoning by analogy, which essentially means copying what other people do with slight variations,\u201d explains Musk.\n\nDeconstruct\n\nFirst principles thinking relies on deconstructing a problem, questioning the fundamental assumptions that you believe you \u2018know\u2019 about a business challenge or scenario. Then when you are down to the very essence, the first principles, creating new knowledge, a distinct solution from scratch. In contrast, thinking by analogy is what the majority in business community follow.\n\nFirst principles thinking takes some time and effort, but when mastered allows a manager to have the potential to innovate in a disruptive way, and in the process solve tricky problems, enroute to greater prosperity.\n\nSo to start, spend some time in a quiet space \u2014 with pen and paper \u2014 thinking about the business problem. \u201cIf I had an hour to solve a problem, I\u2019d spend 55 minutes thinking about the problem and five minutes thinking about solutions\u201d was Albert Einstein\u2019s suggestion.\n\nElon Musk suggests three simple steps on the path to first principles thinking:\n\nStep One \u2013 Identify your current assumptions\n\nDon\u2019t be shy, get it all out. Write down everything you assume to be case about the business problem being addressed. If you are in a group, everyone can in confidence write their assumptions on index cards, and then put them on the wall and cluster them by theme. That way you will be able to visualize, see what all the managers assume to be \u2018what is so\u2019.\n\nStep Two -- Breakdown the problem to first principles\n\n\u201cIt is important to view knowledge as a sort of semantic tree. Make sure you understand the fundamental principles, i.e. the trunk and big branches before you get into the leaves/details, or there is nothing for them to hang on to\u201d says Musk.\n\nFirst principles are the fundamentals, the basic truths, or elements. They are called \u2018first\u2019 because they can\u2019t be broken down any further. Best way to get at the first principles is to ask deep down insightful questions to uncover the ground zero. An example of first principles would be the laws of physics, or mathematics.\n\n[For instance, first law of thermodynamics states that energy can neither be created nor destroyed.] Prime example is taken from the belief that batteries are expensive, here is how Musk sees it:\n\n\u201cSomebody could say, \u201cBattery packs are really expensive and that\u2019s just the way they will always be\u2026 Historically, it has cost $ 600 per kilowatt hour. It\u2019s not going to be much better than that in the future.\n\nWith first principles, you say, \u2018What are the material constituents of the batteries? What is the stock market value of the material constituents?\u2019 It\u2019s got cobalt, nickel, aluminium, carbon, some polymers for separation and a seal can. Break that down on a material basis and say, \u2018If we bought that on the London Metal Exchange what would each of those things cost?\u2019\n\nIt\u2019s like $80 per kilowatt hour. So clearly you just need to think of clever ways to take those materials and combine them into the shape of a battery cell and you can have batteries that are much, much cheaper than anyone realizes\u201d explains the disruptive inventor.\n\nThe key here is to challenge accepted beliefs, stereotypes, by asking questions challenging conventional wisdom.\n\nOnce you have deconstructed, broken down the problem and assumptions to their basic truths, come up with new solutions from scratch. Usually, when we are faced with tricky problems our default mode is to approach like everyone else, after all it just plain easier. Applying first principle thinking allows managers to break out of a \u2018herd mentality, get outside the box, and create disruptive products and services to age-old problems.\n\n\u201cGood ideas are always crazy until they\u2019re not\u201d Musk reminds us.", "articleBodyHtml": "<article>\n\n<h4><a href=\"https://www.businessdailyafrica.com/bd/lifestyle/society\" title=\"Society\">Society</a></h4>\n\n<figure><img src=\"data:image/png;base64,iVBORw0KGgoAAAANSUhEUgAAAAEAAAABCAQAAAC1HAwCAAAAC0lEQVR42mNkYAAAAAYAAjCB0C8AAAAASUVORK5CYII=\" alt=\"innovation\" title=\"\" data-cm-responsive-media='[{\"name\":\"landscape_ratio16x9\",\"ratioWidth\":16,\"ratioHeight\":9,\"linksForWidth\":{\"200\":\"/resource/image/3651614/landscape_ratio16x9/200/112/d3f31b0291a545347bdc8a3ed839e322/zs/innovation.jpg\",\"300\":\"/resource/image/3651614/landscape_ratio16x9/300/168/d3f31b0291a545347bdc8a3ed839e322/fo/innovation.jpg\",\"400\":\"/resource/image/3651614/landscape_ratio16x9/400/225/d3f31b0291a545347bdc8a3ed839e322/KH/innovation.jpg\",\"1160\":\"/resource/image/3651614/landscape_ratio16x9/1160/652/d3f31b0291a545347bdc8a3ed839e322/Hr/innovation.jpg\"}},{\"name\":\"portrait_ratio2x3\",\"ratioWidth\":2,\"ratioHeight\":3,\"linksForWidth\":{\"200\":\"/resource/image/3651614/portrait_ratio2x3/200/300/4649e5879a90eb0690d7ba9e22509f21/Ys/innovation.jpg\",\"400\":\"/resource/image/3651614/portrait_ratio2x3/400/600/4649e5879a90eb0690d7ba9e22509f21/sx/innovation.jpg\",\"768\":\"/resource/image/3651614/portrait_ratio2x3/768/1152/4649e5879a90eb0690d7ba9e22509f21/qN/innovation.jpg\"}},{\"name\":\"landscape_ratio2x1\",\"ratioWidth\":2,\"ratioHeight\":1,\"linksForWidth\":{\"200\":\"/resource/image/3651614/landscape_ratio2x1/200/100/6d5c9519ecc9fe9be7d433dbb2499002/rC/innovation.jpg\"}},{\"name\":\"landscape_ratio3x2\",\"ratioWidth\":3,\"ratioHeight\":2,\"linksForWidth\":{\"300\":\"/resource/image/3651614/landscape_ratio3x2/300/200/17693e1f4d94b7296c28e16335f7c0f9/bO/innovation.jpg\",\"400\":\"/resource/image/3651614/landscape_ratio3x2/400/267/17693e1f4d94b7296c28e16335f7c0f9/FU/innovation.jpg\",\"768\":\"/resource/image/3651614/landscape_ratio3x2/768/512/17693e1f4d94b7296c28e16335f7c0f9/aa/innovation.jpg\"}},{\"name\":\"portrait_ratio1x1\",\"ratioWidth\":1,\"ratioHeight\":1,\"linksForWidth\":{\"50\":\"/resource/image/3651614/portrait_ratio1x1/50/50/dcda212b6dab3aaac73b47e5b693c932/NK/innovation.jpg\",\"60\":\"/resource/image/3651614/portrait_ratio1x1/60/60/dcda212b6dab3aaac73b47e5b693c932/eX/innovation.jpg\",\"200\":\"/resource/image/3651614/portrait_ratio1x1/200/200/dcda212b6dab3aaac73b47e5b693c932/Pf/innovation.jpg\",\"400\":\"/resource/image/3651614/portrait_ratio1x1/400/400/dcda212b6dab3aaac73b47e5b693c932/pZ/innovation.jpg\",\"768\":\"/resource/image/3651614/portrait_ratio1x1/768/768/dcda212b6dab3aaac73b47e5b693c932/NK/innovation.jpg\"}},{\"name\":\"landscape_ratio4x3\",\"ratioWidth\":4,\"ratioHeight\":3,\"linksForWidth\":{\"200\":\"/resource/image/3651614/landscape_ratio4x3/200/150/9b01da02342da7184743a45a04adf8ec/lQ/innovation.jpg\",\"400\":\"/resource/image/3651614/landscape_ratio4x3/400/300/9b01da02342da7184743a45a04adf8ec/wj/innovation.jpg\",\"768\":\"/resource/image/3651614/landscape_ratio4x3/768/576/9b01da02342da7184743a45a04adf8ec/ib/innovation.jpg\"}}]'>\n\n<figcaption><p>Business, innovation &amp; leadership concept.

That way you will be able to visualize, see what all the managers assume to be \u2018what is so\u2019.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Step Two -- Breakdown the problem to first principles</strong></p>\n\n<p>\u201cIt is important to view knowledge as a sort of semantic tree. Make sure you understand the fundamental principles, i.e. the trunk and big branches before you get into the leaves/details, or there is nothing for them to hang on to\u201d says Musk.</p>\n\n<p>First principles are the fundamentals, the basic truths, or elements. They are called \u2018first\u2019 because they can\u2019t be broken down any further. Best way to get at the first principles is to ask deep down insightful questions to uncover the ground zero. An example of first principles would be the laws of physics, or mathematics.</p>\n\n<p>[For instance, first law of thermodynamics states that energy can neither be created nor destroyed.] Prime example is taken from the belief that batteries are expensive, here is how Musk sees it:</p>\n\n<p>\u201cSomebody could say, \u201cBattery packs are really expensive and that\u2019s just the way they will always be\u2026 Historically, it has cost $ 600 per kilowatt hour. It\u2019s not going to be much better than that in the future.</p>\n\n<p>With first principles, you say, \u2018What are the material constituents of the batteries? What is the stock market value of the material constituents?\u2019 It\u2019s got cobalt, nickel, aluminium, carbon, some polymers for separation and a seal can. Break that down on a material basis and say, \u2018If we bought that on the London Metal Exchange what would each of those things cost?\u2019</p>\n\n<p>It\u2019s like $80 per kilowatt hour. So clearly you just need to think of clever ways to take those materials and combine them into the shape of a battery cell and you can have batteries that are much, much cheaper than anyone realizes\u201d explains the disruptive inventor.</p>\n\n<p>The key here is to challenge accepted beliefs, stereotypes, by asking questions challenging conventional wisdom.</p>\n\n<p>Once you have deconstructed, broken down the problem and assumptions to their basic truths, come up with new solutions from scratch. Usually, when we are faced with tricky problems our default mode is to approach like everyone else, after all it just plain easier. Applying first principle thinking allows managers to break out of a \u2018herd mentality, get outside the box, and create disruptive products and services to age-old problems.</p>\n\n<p>\u201cGood ideas are always crazy until they\u2019re not\u201d Musk reminds us.</p>\n\n</article>", "canonicalUrl": "https://www.businessdailyafrica.com/bd/lifestyle/society/think-disruptive-innovation-3651602"},{"url": "https://www.businessdailyafrica.com/bd/opinion-analysis/columnists/bitcoin-modern-day-teflon-don-global-money-market-3652908", "probability": 0.96578413, "headline": "Is bitcoin modern-day Teflon Don in global money market?", "datePublished": "2021-12-14T21:00:00+00:00", "datePublishedRaw": "2021-12-14T21:00:00Z", "dateModified": "2021-12-14T14:33:55+00:00", "dateModifiedRaw": "2021-12-14T14:33:55Z", "author": "RUFUS MWANYASI", "authorsList": ["RUFUS MWANYASI"], "inLanguage": "en", "breadcrumbs": [{"name": "Home", "link": "https://www.businessdailyafrica.com/bd"}, {"name": "Opinion & Analysis", "link": "https://www.businessdailyafrica.com/bd/opinion-analysis"}, {"name": "Columnists", "link": "https://www.businessdailyafrica.com/bd/opinion-analysis/columnists"}], "mainImage": "https://www.businessdailyafrica.com/resource/blob/3652912/bd133176a4d9e90582eaa513107320ba/bitcoin-data.jpg", "description": "\n\"Teflon Don\u201d is a nickname that was given to one time notorious American Gangster, John Gotti.", "articleBody": "Columnists\n\n\"Teflon Don\u201d is a nickname that was given to one time notorious American Gangster, John Gotti.

research fellow at the Egerton-based Tegemeo Institute of Research and Policy, says it is unlikely that there is a shortage of maize in the country because farmers have just harvested the main crop.\n\n\u201cFarmers are just being strategic because they have realised that there could be a shortage and they want to release their stocks to the market when the prices are in their favour,\u201d said Dr Njagi.\n\nThe government has however projected a 20 percent decline in production from this season\u2019s main crop on the back of erratic rainfall and infestation from the fall armyworms during planting time in March.\n\nThe price of a two kilogramme packet of maize flour has remained above Sh100 since January and is currently retailing at an average of Sh108.\n\nThe high cost of flour will add more pressure on the households at a time when they are grappling with an increase in prices of other basic commodities.", "articleBodyHtml": "<article>\n\n<figure><img

When impacted by extreme weather, farmers registered with the scheme automatically receive their compensation.\n\nEven though the insurance scheme has proven popular, there have been challenges as a result of the model used to determine payouts. For instance, while the satellite images provide a general view of wide geographical areas, they do not measure rainfall or drought levels at localised or specific areas.\n\nThis can lead to farmers not receiving the payouts they need when the crops fail. The smallholder farmers are also expected to incur costs by \u2018loss assessors\u2019, who determine if payouts are required to be made to the affected growers, making index-based insurance expensive.\n\nIt is for this reason that Agriculture and Climate Risk Enterprise (ACRE Africa) has introduced a new scheme that combines satellite data and smartphone imagery to provide more localised information in the event of weather-induced crop catastrophes.\n\nThe initiative is part of the Cultivate Africa\u2019s Future (CultiAF) programme, which is jointly funded by the International Development Research Centre and the Australian Centre for International Agriculture Research.\n\nDubbed \u2018picture-based insurance\u2019 (PBI), the scheme requires selected farmers to periodically take photos on behalf of fellow growers at different crop growth stages \u2014 including at planting, mid-season, and before and after harvesting.\n\nThis data is then combined with satellite imagery and used by insurance companies and associated agronomists to determine whether a farmer is eligible for a payout and, if so, how much.\n\nPicture-based insurance also provides farmers with access to high-quality certified seeds, input financing, agricultural advice, and agronomist-led information on regional weather conditions to boost their productivity.\n\n\u201cThrough the use of satellite and smartphone imagery, and providing eyes on the ground to observe farm management practices, the PBI scheme addresses the challenges of basis risk, discrepancies between insurance payouts and actual farmer losses, and ultimately, poor trust in insurers among farmers,\u201d says Lilian Waithaka, picture-based insurance project manager.\n\n\u201cPBI also promotes the adoption of resilient farming technologies and works to better engage smallholder farmers which helps to further improve trust.\u201d\n\nTo ensure that picture-based insurance works on the ground, the scheme relies on \u2018village champions\u2019, who are trained on the various aspects of insurance, why crops should be insured, and how different agronomic practices, such as mulching, can increase their yields.\n\nThese champions pass on their newfound knowledge and skills to other farmers, to persuade them to take up the insurance product.\n\nFarmers can sign up for picture-based insurance by simply dialling a USSD code on their phones. Payments for the insurance premiums are also completed on their mobiles, using the M-Pesa mobile money service, ranging between Sh50 and Sh1,000.\n\nOnce payouts are triggered and verified, the money is sent directly to the farmers\u2019 M-Pesa account.\n\nIn Bungoma and Busia counties, where the project is currently being rolled out, 6,000 maize, bean and sorghum farmers have registered with the insurance scheme with 60 champion farmers leading the initiative in the two regions.\n\n\u201cWhen we launched this project in 2019, the initial idea was for each champion farmer to have 250 farmers in their network. They had even collected all the farmers\u2019 details,\u201d says Patyster Lusweti, ACRE Africa supervisor.\n\n\u201cThen Covid-19 struck, and we were forced to cut to between 20 and 40 per champion farmer to adhere to guidelines on reduced movement and social distancing.\u201d\n\nJohn Poi Namanjelie, a champion farmer in Bungoma County, practises mixed farming \u2014 growing vegetables, fruits, maize, beans, bananas, and sorghum \u2014 on his 1.2-hectare farm and was previously only producing enough for subsistence.\n\nBut since embracing picture-based insurance, Mr Namanjelie says he has increased his yields and he is now selling the produce at a local market.\n\nHe also trains other farmers in good management practices and the importance of insuring their crops.\n\n\u201cFarmers in the area have warmed to the idea of this insurance, mostly because they have seen the payouts happening and because we, their fellow farmers, are the ones selling the insurance,\u201d said Mr Namanjelie.\n\nAdopting picture-based insurance has also provided an unexpected benefit for Mary Nasimiyu, a young farmer in Bungoma.\n\nWith access to higher-quality maize seeds as part of the picture-based insurance scheme, Ms Nasimiyu has improved her yields, enabling the farmer to sell her produce at local markets, diversify into other crops and set up a boutique. She has also recruited other young people, the majority of whom had resisted going into farming due to low yields.\n\n\u201cDue to crop diversification and with new ways of farming, I have received a lot of requests from young people who are keen to join farming,\u201d said Ms Nasimiyu.\n\n\u201cI am happy of the small revolution that we are together creating in encouraging more youth to farm.\u201d\n\nAs more farmers take up this insurance, there has been growing demand to increase the crops covered and to introduce more inputs to the scheme.\n\n\u201cWe recently surveyed farmers\u2019 willingness to purchase other inputs, such as fertiliser and crop protection products, including pesticides and herbicides, if these are incorporated into the insurance scheme,\u201d said ACRE.", "articleBodyHtml": "<article>\n\n<h2><a href=\"https://www.businessdailyafrica.com/bd/data-hub\" title=\"Data Hub\">Data Hub</a></h2>\n\n<figure><img src=\"data:image/png;base64,iVBORw0KGgoAAAANSUhEUgAAAAEAAAABCAQAAAC1HAwCAAAAC0lEQVR42mNkYAAAAAYAAjCB0C8AAAAASUVORK5CYII=\" alt=\"farm\" title=\"\" data-cm-responsive-media='[{\"name\":\"landscape_ratio16x9\",\"ratioWidth\":16,\"ratioHeight\":9,\"linksForWidth\":{\"200\":\"/resource/image/3650630/landscape_ratio16x9/200/112/b1227f85c636b3d386090cbc2a6c50a1/At/farm.jpg\",\"300\":\"/resource/image/3650630/landscape_ratio16x9/300/168/b1227f85c636b3d386090cbc2a6c50a1/eh/farm.jpg\",\"400\":\"/resource/image/3650630/landscape_ratio16x9/400/225/b1227f85c636b3d386090cbc2a6c50a1/Wc/farm.jpg\",\"1160\":\"/resource/image/3650630/landscape_ratio16x9/1160/652/b1227f85c636b3d386090cbc2a6c50a1/ss/farm.jpg\"}},{\"name\":\"portrait_ratio2x3\",\"ratioWidth\":2,\"ratioHeight\":3,\"linksForWidth\":{\"200\":\"/resource/image/3650630/portrait_ratio2x3/200/300/cca8cb19b6ae470bacaa72502684047c/aR/farm.jpg\",\"400\":\"/resource/image/3650630/portrait_ratio2x3/400/600/cca8cb19b6ae470bacaa72502684047c/PC/farm.jpg\",\"768\":\"/resource/image/3650630/portrait_ratio2x3/768/1152/cca8cb19b6ae470bacaa72502684047c/iq/farm.jpg\"}},{\"name\":\"landscape_ratio2x1\",\"ratioWidth\":2,\"ratioHeight\":1,\"linksForWidth\":{\"200\":\"/resource/image/3650630/landscape_ratio2x1/200/100/d1aa5538b279c34fce3e6e3c8a9d1c01/MI/farm.jpg\"}},{\"name\":\"landscape_ratio3x2\",\"ratioWidth\":3,\"ratioHeight\":2,\"linksForWidth\":{\"300\":\"/resource/image/3650630/landscape_ratio3x2/300/200/d92215d2c0eedff8fa4413c89836af6d/tX/farm.jpg\",\"400\":\"/resource/image/3650630/landscape_ratio3x2/400/267/d92215d2c0eedff8fa4413c89836af6d/EJ/farm.jpg\",\"768\":\"/resource/image/3650630/landscape_ratio3x2/768/512/d92215d2c0eedff8fa4413c89836af6d/cj/farm.jpg\"}},{\"name\":\"portrait_ratio1x1\",\"ratioWidth\":1,\"ratioHeight\":1,\"linksForWidth\":{\"50\":\"/resource/image/3650630/portrait_ratio1x1/50/50/42c6433c3e2e3146ca6acd3803d17750/Uu/farm.jpg\",\"60\":\"/resource/image/3650630/portrait_ratio1x1/60/60/42c6433c3e2e3146ca6acd3803d17750/aH/farm.jpg\",\"200\":\"/resource/image/3650630/portrait_ratio1x1/200/200/42c6433c3e2e3146ca6acd3803d17750/ij/farm.jpg\",\"400\":\"/resource/image/3650630/portrait_ratio1x1/400/400/42c6433c3e2e3146ca6acd3803d17750/ZJ/farm.jpg\",\"768\":\"/resource/image/3650630/portrait_ratio1x1/768/768/42c6433c3e2e3146ca6acd3803d17750/cu/farm.jpg\"}},{\"name\":\"landscape_ratio4x3\",\"ratioWidth\":4,\"ratioHeight\":3,\"linksForWidth\":{\"200\":\"/resource/image/3650630/landscape_ratio4x3/200/150/33e3c4119e124c840888f316ca749f/xy/farm.jpg\",\"400\":\"/resource/image/3650630/landscape_ratio4x3/400/300/33e3c4119e124c840888f316ca749f/iN/farm.jpg\",\"768\":\"/resource/image/3650630/landscape_ratio4x3/768/576/33e3c4119e124c840888f316ca749f/wF/farm.jpg\"}}]'>\n\n<figcaption><p>A Motorist tries remove a cow from the road as Livestock die of hunger-related conditions at Kamale area in Magarini, Kilifi County in this photo taken on 25th September 2021.

She has also recruited other young people, the majority of whom had resisted going into farming due to low yields.</p>\n\n<p>\u201cDue to crop diversification and with new ways of farming, I have received a lot of requests from young people who are keen to join farming,\u201d said Ms Nasimiyu.</p>\n\n<p>\u201cI am happy of the small revolution that we are together creating in encouraging more youth to farm.\u201d</p>\n\n<p>As more farmers take up this insurance, there has been growing demand to increase the crops covered and to introduce more inputs to the scheme.</p>\n\n<p>\u201cWe recently surveyed farmers\u2019 willingness to purchase other inputs, such as fertiliser and crop protection products, including pesticides and herbicides, if these are incorporated into the insurance scheme,\u201d said ACRE.</p>\n\n</article>", "canonicalUrl": "https://www.businessdailyafrica.com/bd/data-hub/picture-based-insurance-cushion-farmers-climate-change-3650624"},{"url": "https://www.businessdailyafrica.com/bd/data-hub/rising-number-accidents-defies-efforts-improve-road-safety-3652920", "probability": 0.97455466, "headline": "Rising number of accidents defies efforts to improve road safety", "datePublished": "2021-12-14T21:00:00+00:00", "datePublishedRaw": "2021-12-14T21:00:00Z", "dateModified": "2021-12-14T14:43:53+00:00", "dateModifiedRaw": "2021-12-14T14:43:53Z", "author": "Winnie Onyando", "authorsList": ["Winnie Onyando"], "inLanguage": "en", "breadcrumbs": [{"name": "Home", "link": "https://www.businessdailyafrica.com/bd"}, {"name": "Data Hub", "link": "https://www.businessdailyafrica.com/bd/data-hub"}], "mainImage": "https://www.businessdailyafrica.com/resource/blob/3652930/8bc9de9137267b7e364b415fc772a8d5/accident-data.jpg", "description": "\nMore than two weeks ago, a school bus plunged into the raging waters of Enziu River in Mwingi, killing more than 30 people.", "articleBody": "Data Hub\n\nMore than two weeks ago, a school bus plunged into the raging waters of Enziu River in Mwingi, killing more than 30 people.\n\nA report released last month by the National Transport and Safety Authority (NTSA showed that the number of road accident deaths in the 11 months to November stood at 4,023, up from 3,340 in the corresponding period in 2020.\n\nThe increase is worrying since it appears to defy efforts made over many years by road safety agencies to improve the quality of driving and observance of motoring rules.\n\nThough the blame is largely pointed at drivers and other road users, the traffic police department that is meant to enforce road rules is also to blame for the problem.\n\n\u201cThe main causes of the accidents are speeding, dangerous overtaking, distracted driving, lane indiscipline, drunk driving and fatigue especially among long-distance drivers,\u201d said the NTSA.\n\nThe country is not lacking in terms of laws and agencies meant to enhance road safety, both in terms of physical infrastructure and enforcement of rules.\n\nThe Kenya Roads Act was enacted in 2007 and the country has also set up three road implementing authorities (Kenya National Highways Authority, Kenya Rural Roads Authority and Kenya Urban Roads Authority).\n\nThere is also the NTSA, which was set up in 2012 to register and license vehicles, drivers and driving schools, and formulate policies to promote road safety.\n\nImplementation of rules has, however, been lacking, especially in the public transport sector that has seen matatus roll back many of the rules introduced in 2004 under what was known as 'Michuki Rules'.\n\nThe most disregarded rules are those requiring public service vehicles to fit a working speed governor, and for passengers to wear seatbelts at all times.\n\nDue to lax enforcement, the number of deaths in road accidents has gone up over the years.\n\nThe jump in road accidents is also tied to the State\u2019s inability to effectively control the motorcycle taxis known as boda boda that flout rules.\n\nKenya, like most African countries, offers a huge potential for motorcycle ride-hailing firms due to low personal car ownership, rapidly expanding populations and a lack of efficient mass transport systems in fast-growing cities that are clogged with cars.\n\nOfficial data shows annual registrations have doubled in five years to stand at 252,601 compared to the 2016 figure of 123,539.

I use the money to pay school fees for my seven children, buy drinking water, school uniforms, and other food such as maize that I do not grow,\u201d she said.\n\nApart from the Israel Youth Group farm, other youth-oriented farming groups are based at the 400-acre Namakat farm and the 260-acre Natuntun farm.", "articleBodyHtml": "<article>\n\n<h4><a href=\"https://www.businessdailyafrica.com/bd/data-hub\" title=\"Data Hub\">Data Hub</a></h4>\n\n<figure><img src=\"data:image/png;base64,iVBORw0KGgoAAAANSUhEUgAAAAEAAAABCAQAAAC1HAwCAAAAC0lEQVR42mNkYAAAAAYAAjCB0C8AAAAASUVORK5CYII=\" alt=\"tomatoes\" title=\"\" data-cm-responsive-media='[{\"name\":\"landscape_ratio16x9\",\"ratioWidth\":16,\"ratioHeight\":9,\"linksForWidth\":{\"200\":\"/resource/image/3651812/landscape_ratio16x9/200/112/8b3c388e6bad58b6a61fc89dbe1319be/ch/tomatoes.jpg\",\"300\":\"/resource/image/3651812/landscape_ratio16x9/300/168/8b3c388e6bad58b6a61fc89dbe1319be/ZJ/tomatoes.jpg\",\"400\":\"/resource/image/3651812/landscape_ratio16x9/400/225/8b3c388e6bad58b6a61fc89dbe1319be/Wg/tomatoes.jpg\",\"1160\":\"/resource/image/3651812/landscape_ratio16x9/1160/652/8b3c388e6bad58b6a61fc89dbe1319be/ts/tomatoes.jpg\"}},{\"name\":\"portrait_ratio2x3\",\"ratioWidth\":2,\"ratioHeight\":3,\"linksForWidth\":{\"200\":\"/resource/image/3651812/portrait_ratio2x3/200/300/afc9e9de6919bdd208c1e1616991da00/VV/tomatoes.jpg\",\"400\":\"/resource/image/3651812/portrait_ratio2x3/400/600/afc9e9de6919bdd208c1e1616991da00/fi/tomatoes.jpg\",\"768\":\"/resource/image/3651812/portrait_ratio2x3/768/1152/afc9e9de6919bdd208c1e1616991da00/bW/tomatoes.jpg\"}},{\"name\":\"landscape_ratio2x1\",\"ratioWidth\":2,\"ratioHeight\":1,\"linksForWidth\":{\"200\":\"/resource/image/3651812/landscape_ratio2x1/200/100/580977146eb93ab220e1f94e4268c367/mL/tomatoes.jpg\"}},{\"name\":\"landscape_ratio3x2\",\"ratioWidth\":3,\"ratioHeight\":2,\"linksForWidth\":{\"300\":\"/resource/image/3651812/landscape_ratio3x2/300/200/8c4578b9e8a92dc1b4e9e66cc264b6a0/QI/tomatoes.jpg\",\"400\":\"/resource/image/3651812/landscape_ratio3x2/400/267/8c4578b9e8a92dc1b4e9e66cc264b6a0/fq/tomatoes.jpg\",\"768\":\"/resource/image/3651812/landscape_ratio3x2/768/512/8c4578b9e8a92dc1b4e9e66cc264b6a0/UQ/tomatoes.jpg\"}},{\"name\":\"portrait_ratio1x1\",\"ratioWidth\":1,\"ratioHeight\":1,\"linksForWidth\":{\"50\":\"/resource/image/3651812/portrait_ratio1x1/50/50/b5f37b761434fac7488cde8d089ef716/kv/tomatoes.jpg\",\"60\":\"/resource/image/3651812/portrait_ratio1x1/60/60/b5f37b761434fac7488cde8d089ef716/dc/tomatoes.jpg\",\"200\":\"/resource/image/3651812/portrait_ratio1x1/200/200/b5f37b761434fac7488cde8d089ef716/Xg/tomatoes.jpg\",\"400\":\"/resource/image/3651812/portrait_ratio1x1/400/400/b5f37b761434fac7488cde8d089ef716/AO/tomatoes.jpg\",\"768\":\"/resource/image/3651812/portrait_ratio1x1/768/768/b5f37b761434fac7488cde8d089ef716/Vb/tomatoes.jpg\"}},{\"name\":\"landscape_ratio4x3\",\"ratioWidth\":4,\"ratioHeight\":3,\"linksForWidth\":{\"200\":\"/resource/image/3651812/landscape_ratio4x3/200/150/91612b0ead536c449b33534b2927e5fc/Tg/tomatoes.jpg\",\"400\":\"/resource/image/3651812/landscape_ratio4x3/400/300/91612b0ead536c449b33534b2927e5fc/Df/tomatoes.jpg\",\"768\":\"/resource/image/3651812/landscape_ratio4x3/768/576/91612b0ead536c449b33534b2927e5fc/hn/tomatoes.jpg\"}}]'>\n\n<figcaption><p>Elizabeth Lokopon attending to tomatoes on April 3, 2020.

It is covered in different crops that include maize, tomatoes, bell pepper, pawpaw, onions, bananas and yellow-fleshed sweet potatoes.</p>\n\n<h2>Sh40 a kilo</h2>\n\n<p>Mr Lomuria joined the group and like any new member, he was trained in how to farm and mentored on accessing the market.</p>\n\n<p>\"Within months, I became the bread winner in my family that was primarily relying on relief food for survival. We had enough vegetables and maize that significantly reduced hunger and poverty,\" Mr Lomuria says as he harvests pawpaw for a customer. The trees are intercropped in a large maize field.</p>\n\n<p>He earns Sh40 per kilo of pawpaw, and from that one customer alone he made Sh400.</p>\n\n<p>\"We are expecting to harvest maize on our 10 acres plantation this month. However, the market is not favourable, because every farmer is looking to sell their produce at nearby Katilu centre; a 90-kilogramme bag of maize is selling at between Sh1,700 and Sh2,000,\u201d Mr Lomuria adds.</p>\n\n<p>Despite the low prices, he and his fellow farmers are far better off compared to their peers who rely on handouts, or even go into banditry with eyes on a few animals.</p>\n\n<p>For an area where farming has not always been a way of life, it has taken a big leap of faith for people such as Lomuria to venture into agribusiness.</p>\n\n<p>They are attracting more young people to irrigation farming though because their families always have enough to eat even when others are relying on relief food when rains fail and there is no pasture for livestock.</p>\n\n<p>The Israel Youth Group has appealed to local leaders to support youth in farming through grants that can be used to expand farms, seed capital to invest in high-value seeds and to offer transport when moving produce to more favourable markets across the county.</p>\n\n<p>In Turkana, longstanding lack of political goodwill towards farming discourages many from embracing the venture.</p>\n\n<h2>Persistence, commitment</h2>\n\n<p>The group\u2019s persistence and commitment to tackle food insecurity in Turkana and boost their income has attracted financial support from PanAfricare Organisation through its IMPACT Programme that is in turn financed by Bayer Fund.</p>\n\n<p>The organisation has helped by repairing canals that direct water to the farm, donating yellow-fleshed sweet potato tubers and providing extension services.</p>\n\n<p>\"We appeal to the organisation to also help us get a reliable market because we are embracing the tubers for crop rotation,\" says Mr Losokon.</p>\n\n<p>Kassim Lupao, a nutritionist at PanAfricare, says that in partnership with Turkana County they are expanding farms under irrigation through repairing canals or constructing new ones to accommodate more farmers facing hunger in Katilu and Turkwel wards as well as distribution of seeds of highly nutritious crops.</p>\n\n<p>\"The organisation has been ploughing using tractors as well as expanding farms by clearing thorny prosopis julifulora (mathenge) thickets,\" Mr Lupao said.</p>\n\n<p>Through such support, Mary Amekwi, who is a farmer allied to the group said that she has a half-acre land where she produces cowpeas, spinach, green grams, tomatoes, kales, and watermelon after being given seeds from PanAfricare that are now her source of income and food.</p>\n\n<p>\"I sell most of what I get from my farm at my stall located at Katilu shopping centre. I use the money to pay school fees for my seven children, buy drinking water, school uniforms, and other food such as maize that I do not grow,\u201d she said.</p>\n\n<p>Apart from the Israel Youth Group farm, other youth-oriented farming groups are based at the 400-acre Namakat farm and the 260-acre Natuntun farm.</p>\n\n</article>", "canonicalUrl": "https://www.businessdailyafrica.com/bd/data-hub/youth-embrace-farming-bandits-kill-pastoralism-dreams-3651810"},{"url": "https://www.businessdailyafrica.com/bd/data-hub/turkwel-siltation-threatens-irrigation-electricity-production-3651820", "probability": 0.98543525, "headline": "Turkwel basin siltation threatens irrigation, electricity production", "datePublished": "2021-12-13T21:00:00+00:00", "datePublishedRaw": "2021-12-13T21:00:00Z", "dateModified": "2021-12-13T16:04:23+00:00", "dateModifiedRaw": "2021-12-13T16:04:23Z", "author": "Barnabas Bii", "authorsList": ["Barnabas Bii"], "inLanguage": "en", "breadcrumbs": [{"name": "Home", "link": "https://www.businessdailyafrica.com/bd"}, {"name": "Data Hub", "link": "https://www.businessdailyafrica.com/bd/data-hub"}], "mainImage": "https://www.businessdailyafrica.com/resource/blob/3651822/44fe17798c8b19d8d42d76244fd2aeb6/turkwel-data.jpg", "description": "\nEnvironmental experts have warned that the Suam River Basin, the main source of water for the Sh6 billion Turkwel hydropower and multi-purpose dam in West Pokot faces an uncertain future due to...", "articleBody": "Data Hub\n\nEnvironmental experts have warned that the Suam River Basin, the main source of water for the Sh6 billion Turkwel hydropower and multi-purpose dam in West Pokot faces an uncertain future due to heavy siltation.\n\nThe siltation is blamed on poor agricultural practices and deforestation of the Cherang\u2019any and Mt Elgon water towers.\n\nEnvironmentalists say the future of the Turkwel ecosystem that includes the dam and the thousands of people who depend on the river downstream for drinking water and irrigation face a bleak future.\n\n\u201cSiltation at Suam River Basin currently stands at 30,000 cubic metres and it will be unable to sustain sufficient volumes of water to sustain adequate power supply in the next 50 years unless proper conservation measures are put in place,\u201d said Sammy Naporos, the managing director of the Kerio Valley Development Authority (KVDA).\n\n\u201cTurkwel Dam is being silted over time and there is a need for conservation of Cherang\u2019any and Mt Elgon catchment areas to improve forest cover and save the Suam River basin.\u201d\n\nThe dam with a storage capacity of 1,641 million cubic metres is owned by KVDA but has been leased by the government to power generating firm KenGen.\n\nIt also supports downstream irrigation schemes such as Nakwomoru, Katilu, Loyapat and other agricultural projects that promote crop production and attainment of food security.\n\nHeavy siltation threatens commercial fishing \u2014 an important alternative source of income to more than 300,000 people surrounding the facility.\n\nThey are recording declining catches due to the reducing water levels and lack of restocking of fingerlings.\n\nMany of the residents have invested in commercial fishing as alternatives to pastoralism, which has been hit hard by banditry and cattle rustling over the years.\n\nWest Pokot Agriculture and pastoral economy executive member Geoffrey Lipale says the decline in water volumes at the dam has hit fishing activities.\n\n\u201cWe have more than 2,000 fishers up from 300 some years back, which has contributed to declining fish stocks at the dam,\u201d said Mr Lipale.\n\nThe KVDA recently distributed 25,000 tree seedlings mainly indigenous species to 16 schools as part of afforestation meant to save the basin.\n\nThreatening wetlands\n\nThe National Environmental Complaints Committee (NECC) has also expressed concerns over the heavy siltation of the Suam River Basin, noting that land sub-division and fragmentation due to population pressure was posing a serious threat to wetlands that are home to various animal and plant species.\n\n\u201cWetlands are responsible for keeping rivers at normal level.

The bank therefore sought that the entire sum (of Sh145 million) be distributed to it.\n\n\u201cThe bank is a secured creditor. Its application was served but not opposed. However, the law requires that a portion of the proceeds of an entity under administration be reserved or distributed to the unsecured creditors,\u201d said the judge.\n\nIn the application, the lender contended that between 2013 and 2015, the company took facilities secured by two Debentures for US dollars 4,050,000 and Sh137 million. It also got a further loan of Sh219,108,000.\n\nThe Company fell into hard times and there was default in the repayment of the facilities and was placed under administration in 2019. The administrator was unable to revive the operations of the Company for reasons including that a huge capital was required to revive the operations.\n\nThe administrator thereafter opined that in the interests of the company, its assets should be disposed off.", "articleBodyHtml": "<article>\n\n<h2><a href=\"https://www.businessdailyafrica.com/bd/corporate/companies\" title=\"Companies\">Companies</a></h2>\n\n<figure><img src=\"data:image/png;base64,iVBORw0KGgoAAAANSUhEUgAAAAEAAAABCAQAAAC1HAwCAAAAC0lEQVR42mNkYAAAAAYAAjCB0C8AAAAASUVORK5CYII=\" alt=\"ncba\" title=\"\" data-cm-responsive-media='[{\"name\":\"landscape_ratio16x9\",\"ratioWidth\":16,\"ratioHeight\":9,\"linksForWidth\":{\"200\":\"/resource/image/3650554/landscape_ratio16x9/200/112/8130483754e6de5507c2bb0eaec12661/MG/ncba.jpg\",\"300\":\"/resource/image/3650554/landscape_ratio16x9/300/168/8130483754e6de5507c2bb0eaec12661/pu/ncba.jpg\",\"400\":\"/resource/image/3650554/landscape_ratio16x9/400/225/8130483754e6de5507c2bb0eaec12661/Tx/ncba.jpg\",\"1160\":\"/resource/image/3650554/landscape_ratio16x9/1160/652/8130483754e6de5507c2bb0eaec12661/qN/ncba.jpg\"}},{\"name\":\"portrait_ratio2x3\",\"ratioWidth\":2,\"ratioHeight\":3,\"linksForWidth\":{\"200\":\"/resource/image/3650554/portrait_ratio2x3/200/300/bd77a7261074437e09d9598d069e7945/JJ/ncba.jpg\",\"400\":\"/resource/image/3650554/portrait_ratio2x3/400/600/bd77a7261074437e09d9598d069e7945/WK/ncba.jpg\",\"768\":\"/resource/image/3650554/portrait_ratio2x3/768/1152/bd77a7261074437e09d9598d069e7945/Dq/ncba.jpg\"}},{\"name\":\"landscape_ratio2x1\",\"ratioWidth\":2,\"ratioHeight\":1,\"linksForWidth\":{\"200\":\"/resource/image/3650554/landscape_ratio2x1/200/100/e7dc5b737161b1a664c70ad0ed5503ee/jp/ncba.jpg\"}},{\"name\":\"landscape_ratio3x2\",\"ratioWidth\":3,\"ratioHeight\":2,\"linksForWidth\":{\"300\":\"/resource/image/3650554/landscape_ratio3x2/300/200/89e86d18693e942da8c93065523cb1d9/fS/ncba.jpg\",\"400\":\"/resource/image/3650554/landscape_ratio3x2/400/267/89e86d18693e942da8c93065523cb1d9/fw/ncba.jpg\",\"768\":\"/resource/image/3650554/landscape_ratio3x2/768/512/89e86d18693e942da8c93065523cb1d9/qe/ncba.jpg\"}},{\"name\":\"portrait_ratio1x1\",\"ratioWidth\":1,\"ratioHeight\":1,\"linksForWidth\":{\"50\":\"/resource/image/3650554/portrait_ratio1x1/50/50/7936620b244eaeb6afae6058907ba5f2/io/ncba.jpg\",\"60\":\"/resource/image/3650554/portrait_ratio1x1/60/60/7936620b244eaeb6afae6058907ba5f2/eJ/ncba.jpg\",\"200\":\"/resource/image/3650554/portrait_ratio1x1/200/200/7936620b244eaeb6afae6058907ba5f2/UN/ncba.jpg\",\"400\":\"/resource/image/3650554/portrait_ratio1x1/400/400/7936620b244eaeb6afae6058907ba5f2/wv/ncba.jpg\",\"768\":\"/resource/image/3650554/portrait_ratio1x1/768/768/7936620b244eaeb6afae6058907ba5f2/NM/ncba.jpg\"}},{\"name\":\"landscape_ratio4x3\",\"ratioWidth\":4,\"ratioHeight\":3,\"linksForWidth\":{\"200\":\"/resource/image/3650554/landscape_ratio4x3/200/150/723a6c955fa9f88685069e3424132fa9/Ix/ncba.jpg\",\"400\":\"/resource/image/3650554/landscape_ratio4x3/400/300/723a6c955fa9f88685069e3424132fa9/kg/ncba.jpg\",\"768\":\"/resource/image/3650554/landscape_ratio4x3/768/576/723a6c955fa9f88685069e3424132fa9/kA/ncba.jpg\"}}]'>\n\n<figcaption><p>NCBA premises in Nairobi.

Foreign Affairs of the arrival of their diplomatic staff who have been relocated from the region to enable the ministry to regularise the deployment in the country.\u201d\n\nThough the advisory was generic, it is Ethiopia which has had a deadly conflict since last year when the Tigray People\u2019s Liberation Front (TPLF), a rebel group that was once a ruling party, reportedly attacked a northern command of the Ethiopian National Defence Forces in November last year.\n\nAnd Prime Minister Abiy Ahmed ordered what he called a law enforcement operation on the group.\n\nSince then, the TPLF who had earlier claimed a series of victories, have been pegged back as Mr Ahmed\u2019s frontline appearance is boosted by support from the Middle Eastern allies.\n\nFrom last week, the PM, a Nobel Peace Laureate, announced the TPLF were no longer capable of attacking Addis Ababa as they had threatened before, and cautioned sensationalism from foreign media for what he said was unnecessary scaremongering about the security situation in the country\u2019s capital.\n\nOn Saturday, Addis Ababa announced the national forces had captured more territory in Amhara region that had fallen to TPLF several months earlier.\n\nAbiy\u2019s office said his forces had captured Zobel mountains, Arjo, Fokisa and Boren towns considered strategic as they lie on a major highway.\n\nHe also said towns of Dire Roqana and Sodoma as well as Ambasel had been freed from the TPLF who had fled the scene.\n\nEthiopia is home to the headquarters of the African Union, the continental bloc of 55 member countries.\n\nIt also hosts the offices of the UN Economic Commission for Africa, as well as more than 120 other diplomatic missions.\n\nThe African Union earlier rejected rumours it planned to temporarily relocate due to the war.\n\nInstead, the continental body has been asking for ceasefire and national dialogue between warring parties, a position Nairobi endorses.\n\nNairobi said all requests for redeployment must be done through the requisite diplomatic channels and that all affected staff and their identity and equipment must be provided before actual arrival, including that those staff must have valid travel documents before touching down in Kenya.", "articleBodyHtml": "<article>\n\n<h2><a href=\"https://www.businessdailyafrica.com/bd/news\"

In the past, we have not reciprocated, but now we are going to.

The push to lower the tax on cooking gas comes barely six months after its re-introduction that prompted prices to shoot up.</p>\n\n<p>The price of the 13-kilogramme shot to Sh2,800 in September from Sh2,000 in June, highlighting the adverse effects of the tax.</p>\n\n<p>The Treasury had scrapped VAT on cooking gas in June 2016 to cut costs and spur uptake of clean fuel in place of kerosene and charcoal.</p>\n\n<p>Cooking gas prices stood at an average Sh2, 231 in June 2016, and dropped to below Sh2, 000 in October four months after the scrapping of the 16 percent VAT.</p>\n\n<p>Unlike the fuel prices, which are adjusted on the 15th of every month and stay in place for one month, the government does not control cooking gas prices.</p>\n\n<p>Kenya is banking on the removal of the VAT and price controls after completion of the Kipevu Oil Terminal to lower the price of cooking gas and boost uptake.</p>\n\n<p>The facility will have a common-user berth for handling LPG will allow the State to issue an open tender system (OTS) for gas imports, prompting the shift to control of cooking gas prices.</p>\n\n<p>Under the OTS, the ministry will award one oil marketer the right to import gas in bulk every month on behalf of the entire industry, enjoying huge discounts like the case with other fuels.</p>\n\n<p>Lack of a common-user State facility at Kipevu has locked out firms from handling cooking gas imports at the Port, with only one company handling over 90 percent of the LPG shipments.</p>\n\n</article>", "canonicalUrl": "https://www.businessdailyafrica.com/bd/economy/kra-fails-in-bid-retain-tax-on-gas-3651894"},{"url": "https://www.businessdailyafrica.com/bd/corporate/companies/bolt-drivers-allowed-to-set-their-prices-3653178", "probability": 0.9537098, "headline": "Bolt drivers allowed to set their prices in new changes", "datePublished": "2021-12-14T21:00:00+00:00", "datePublishedRaw": "2021-12-14T21:00:00Z", "dateModified": "2021-12-14T17:26:01+00:00", "dateModifiedRaw": "2021-12-14T17:26:01Z", "author": "ELIZABETH KIVUVA", "authorsList": ["ELIZABETH KIVUVA"], "inLanguage": "en", "breadcrumbs": [{"name": "Home", "link": "https://www.businessdailyafrica.com/bd"}, {"name": "Corporate", "link": "https://www.businessdailyafrica.com/bd/corporate"}, {"name": "Companies", "link": "https://www.businessdailyafrica.com/bd/corporate/companies"}], "mainImage": "https://www.businessdailyafrica.com/resource/blob/3653180/0d3fa8a3855ba3efb560e489e7a7e041/bolt-data.jpg", "description": "\nRide-hailing service Bolt will allow drivers to set their own prices and passengers to select their driver in efforts to make it attractive in its battle with Uber.", "articleBody": "Companies\n\nRide-hailing service Bolt will allow drivers to set their own prices and passengers to select their driver in efforts to make it attractive in its battle with Uber.\n\nDrivers will have the option to use Bolt standard pricing or key in their preferred rates per kilometre after piloting of a new feature in Nairobi.\n\nA rider will also be able to see the drivers rates and expected time of arrival, meaning one can pay more for convenience.\n\nDigital taxis\u2019 drivers have constantly complained of low earnings from the trips, leading to cancellation of trips and longer wait time for riders as motorists cite lower rates.\n\nEstonia-based Bolt and US-based Uber are trying to woo drivers back to their platforms with the promise of more income.\n\n\u201cDrivers have consistently asked us for the ability to set their own prices so they can ensure a journey is profitable enough before it's accepted.

over a Sh315.2 million unpaid legal fees.\n\nThe Insurance Regulatory Authority (IRA) says its operations will be disabled if lawyer Waweru Gatonye is allowed to attach its accounts at the National Bank of Kenya (NBK) #ticker:NBK.\n\nMr Gatonye sought orders to attach the bank accounts two weeks ago after he won an eight-year battle for the legal fees that came after he represented IRA in a court battle against collapsed insurer-- Lakestar Insurance Company.\n\nThe High Court awarded him Sh262.9 million and the fee has increased to Sh315.3 million inclusive of interests.\n\nIRA has appealed against the High Court judgment and has petitioned the judges to freeze the seizure of its accounts pending hearing and determination of the suit.\n\nThe regulator also says if the lawyer is allowed to take money from its accounts then its appeal will be rendered irrelevant with no guarantee of refund in the event the appeal succeeds.\n\n\u201cIf the court grants the orders sought by the creditor in the present application, the entire budget of IRA will be affected and its operations will completely ground to a halt which will occasion a great injustice to the Kenyan public that the applicant serves,\u201d IRA CEO Godffrey Kiptum said in an affidavit.\n\nMr Gatonye has been at loggerheads with the insurance regulator over legal services offered eight years ago in a dispute involving the collapsed Lakestar Insurance Company.\n\nMr Gatonye's law firm demanded Sh262.9 million after representing the authority at the High Court in a case filed by the owner of the collapsed insurance company, John Kipkemboi Kilel, in 2013 where he is seeking compensation of Sh12 billion for closure of the insurer.\n\nIRA's argues that the fee is \u201cmanifestly\u201d high and punitive, saying it is without basis in law, and is \u201cunjust enrichment of the advocate\u201d.\n\nIn the case that is pending determination, Mr Kilel claimed that the winding up of Lakestar Insurance was falsely engineered in 2002.\n\nHe accused former IRA chief executive Sammy Makove of coming up with false information to liquidate the insurance firm.\n\nThe regulator placed Lakestar under statutory management in 2002 before the managers recommended the firm be wound up a year later.\n\nHe sought an award of Sh2 billion for business opportunities lost, Sh3.7 billion for loss of property, capital gains, and cash loss as well as Sh6.2 billion for reputation damage.\n\nHe also sought Sh39.6 million for loss of monthly earnings and Sh6.2 million for loss of earnings from the investment.\n\nAfter filing the case, IRA hired Waweru Gatonye and Company Advocates to defend it in court.\n\nUpon being instructed, the advocates proceeded to prepare and file a Memorandum of Appearance, statement of defence, defendant's (IRA) list of witnesses, and list of documents.", "articleBodyHtml": "<article>\n\n<h2><a href=\"https://www.businessdailyafrica.com/bd/corporate/companies\"

The drones will be used alongside the company helicopter, it said.\n\n\u201cThe adoption of UAV based technology platforms is not just cost-effective but they also increase reliability, improve safety and reduce response times,\u201d said Kenya Power.\n\n\u201cThe adoption of UAV usage by Kenya Power will further future proof the company\u2019s utility business and result in reduced power costs to customers and better customer experience.\u201d\n\nThe utility has invited firms to develop and provide drone technology as soon as possible.\n\nKenya Power joins power producer Kenya Electricity Generating Company (KenGen) which recently bought two drones to inspect its plants at its Olkaria geothermal fields in Naivasha.\n\nKenGen said earlier its UAVs bought at Sh28.7 million would be deployed in the vast Olkaria Fields for surveillance.\n\nUtilities in other parts of the world have increasingly turned to drones to scour large power plants and thousands of kilometres of grids for damage and leaks in an attempt to avoid network failures that cost them billions of shillings a year.\n\nThe flying robots that can travel dozens of kilometres without stopping are seen as the next big thing for power companies.\n\nThermal and zoom imaging placed on drones can help detect defects that then can be fixed before they become a problem, according to experts.\n\nItaly's Snam, Europe's biggest gas utility, said three years ago it tested prototypes of long-distance drones that fly at low altitudes over pipelines and power lines.\n\nFrench energy utility RTE has also tested a long-distance drone, which flew about 50km inspecting transmission lines and sent back data that allowed technicians to virtually model a section of the grid.\n\nDrone use across Kenya is likely to become more widespread as legal hurdles and legislation are overcome.\n\nThe Kenya Forest Service (KFS) said last year it will now use drones as a new weapon to monitor deforestation in gazetted forests as thousands of hectares disappear every year in some of the country\u2019s most biodiverse forests.", "articleBodyHtml": "<article>\n\n<figure><img
