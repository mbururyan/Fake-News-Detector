multi-billion-infrastructure development in the country.\n\nIt supports the consortium through USAID\u2019s Kenya Investment Mechanism, Power Africa, the World Bank Group, and MiDA Advisors (in partnership with USAID INVEST).\n\nIt provides an opportunity for beneficial collaboration between Kenyan and American pension funds and other institutional investors, US Ambassador to Kenya Kyle McCarter said yesterday.\n\n\u201cThe US government is pleased to support a Kenyan institution that presents an innovative approach to infrastructure investment in Kenya,\u201d he said.\n\nThis, he said, follows recent changes to the Retirement Benefits Authority guidelines allowing pension funds in Kenya to invest up to 10 per cent of their assets in infrastructure, potentially unlocking over Sh100 billion ($917 million).\n\nLaunching KEPFIC is a huge milestone, not just for pension schemes, but also for the country, said Sundeep Raichura, KEPFIC board Chairperson.\n\n\u201cWith national and county governments facing a growing budget deficit and competing needs, pension funds through KEPFIC will be well positioned to help bridge the infrastructure funding gap,\u201d Raichura

country\u2019s infrastructure.\n\nThe funds manage assets worth $1 trillion (Sh108.8 trillion).\n\n\u201cBy moving from traditional investments in stocks and bonds to new opportunities in Kenyan roads, power plants and enterprises, Kenyan and U.S. pension funds will strengthen commercial ties between our countries,\u201d McCarter had said.\n\nThe latest development now puts Kenya at a greater position to bridge the infrastructure financing gap which stands at more than $1.8 billion (about Sh200 billion) annually, with key sectors being energy, transportation, and urban development.\n\nTreasury has continued to borrow commercially to fund the development, pushing the country deeper into debt.\n\nPension funds remain an ideal avenue for infrastructure projects due to their longer return on investment horizons and significant role in financing infrastructure projects in many countries, including the US.\n\nHowever, individual pension funds in Kenya frequently lack the capacity to venture into big-ticket infrastructure projects alone.\n\nFormed in 2018 by pension schemes, KEPFIC with a membership of 14 pension funds and a total asset base of over Sh200 billion, is expected to offer a solution by pooling resources from individual funds.\n\nThe consortium intends to mobilise more than Sh25 billion ($229 million) over the next five years for infrastructure investment.\n\nIts membership includes the KRA Staff Pension Scheme, Safaricom Staff Pension Scheme, KenGen Staff Retirement Benefits Scheme, and Kenya Pipeline Company Retirement Benefits Scheme.",

A 50kg bag of cement is needed to produce 30 bricks, Mr Lepugoro says.\n\nBesides selling bricks, Mr Lepugoro says they also build houses for their clients.\n\nFlexible\n\n\u201cWe are flexible and often prepare the bricks at a client\u2019s home to save them transportation costs,\u201d he said in a past interview with the Nation.\n\nThe group sells 2,000 bricks on a good day, each getting at least Sh4,000, part of which goes to their savings plan.\n\nWith his colleague Francis Lowale, they produce 200 bricks daily, making Sh10,000 in sales, which the two share equally, saving some of the money with the group.\n\nMr Lowale, who used to live in Nanyuki, Laikipia County, was on the brink of giving up but says his life has turned around after he joined the group a year ago.\n\n\u201cI came to this (Longopito) village to look for work. I am happy that I can now earn decent pay and sort out my bills without any strain,\u201d Mr Lowale said.\n\nThe young men said their bricks will contribute to President Uhuru Kenyatta\u2019s affordable housing plan in the Big Four agenda.\n\nThey appealed to the local community, which is predominantly pastoralist, to diversify into other income-generating activities as livestock rearing had become unsustainable due to the prolonged drought and ever-changing weather patterns.\n\nYoung people, they said, should shun relying on white-collar jobs but take advantage of available opportunities to earn money and support themselves and their families.\n\n\u201cThere is no need to complain about joblessness when you can do something (like us),\u201d Mr Lowale noted, urging the local community to take advantage of the cheap bricks to build decent houses.\n\nThey do everything manually and they have appealed for help to purchase a machine to aid in mixing materials.", "articleBodyHtml": "<article>\n\n<figure><a href=\"https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/a/AVvXsEiApghcgp80wuCzkqoApluMdflSJ0GoE95g1L-Mir7JBcqBDSI7DBU78HhRPTiTzJ7kboQ3Vnh0o0nHZ_HMR-HStyBn7vrie2UeByfXYDl_W129N6Buc4sOEA2ApDIoTl2Cvuar-gdAZQtRUuI-o_hz47mwy2AokaI8MwxjuQ_ADTnbjEB2RMFrYkjtlg=s960\"><img data-original-height=\"480\" data-original-width=\"960\" src=\"https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/a/AVvXsEiApghcgp80wuCzkqoApluMdflSJ0GoE95g1L-Mir7JBcqBDSI7DBU78HhRPTiTzJ7kboQ3Vnh0o0nHZ_HMR-HStyBn7vrie2UeByfXYDl_W129N6Buc4sOEA2ApDIoTl2Cvuar-gdAZQtRUuI-o_hz47mwy2AokaI8MwxjuQ_ADTnbjEB2RMFrYkjtlg=s320\"></a></figure>\n\n<p>Charles Abel Lepugoro, from Longopito village in Oldonyiro, Isiolo County, set out for Somalia four years ago in search of a job with the hope of lifting his family from biting poverty.</p>\n\n<p>While he remains cagey about how he got there, his hope to land casual jobs and save enough money to support his parents and siblings back home was never to be.</p>\n\n<p>At 28 years old, the desperate youth had earlier travelled to Garissa County to find a job but failed, deciding instead to try his luck in Somalia.</p>\n\n<p>\u201cIt was challenging getting a well-paying job, making it hard for me to survive in Somalia,\u201d he recalls.</p>\n\n<p>Frustrated, he resolved to return home but with no exact idea on what he would do to put food on the table.

They should be given oxygen cylinders and safety jackets to ensure they are also protected,\u201d said another rescuer, Mr Edwin Ogilo.</p>\n\n<p>The county government has, however, denied claims that it has abandoned the rescue mission.</p>\n\n<p>Mr George Aola, the county of the disaster management unit, told the Nation that they are supporting the families of the affected miners through cash donations and also ensuring the machines continue to work.</p>\n\n<p>\u201cWe live in a society where many people may not see the efforts we make, but we are really trying and are hopeful that we will find the trapped miner alive,\u201d said Mr Aola.</p>\n\n<p>He added that they continue to face challenges in the rescue operation, which to him, has been slowed down by the weak ground that has collapsed several times.</p>\n\n<p>\u201cWe have tried to reach Okwach and every time the ground around him collapses. We have tried to use various links but because of the loose soil around him, the same happens. But we are not giving up on him,\u201d said Mr Aola.\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0BY DAILY NATION</p>\n\n</article>", "canonicalUrl": "https://www.breakingkenyanews.com/2021/12/left-to-die-man-still-buried-in-siaya.html"},{"url": "https://www.breakingkenyanews.com/2018/08/twenty-things-you-didnt-know-about.html", "probability": 0.9433566, "headline": "Twenty things you didn\u2019t know about Kenya's First President Jomo Kenyatta", "datePublished": "2018-08-22T00:00:00", "datePublishedRaw": "August 22, 2018", "dateModified": "2018-08-22T13:32:38+00:00", "dateModifiedRaw": "2018-08-22T13:32:38Z", "author": "Breaking Kenya news", "authorsList": ["Breaking Kenya news"], "inLanguage": "en", "breadcrumbs": [{"name": "Home", "link": "https://www.breakingkenyanews.com/"}, {"name": "featured posts", "link": "https://www.breakingkenyanews.com/search/label/featured%20posts"}, {"name": "Twenty things you didn\u2019t know about Kenya's First President Jomo Kenyatta"}], "mainImage": "https://www.standardmedia.co.ke/images/wednesday/qhqxyhsvwjqvov5b7d1b4f77fdc.jpg", "description": " Breaking news, kenya news, county news, politics, business, sports, lifestyle and entertainment from Kenya and around the world", "articleBody": "Missionary teachers at Thogoto Church of Scotland Mission Station thought Kamau wa Ngengi who was born in Ng\u2019enda, Gatundu, in the early 1890s, was only good enough to be a mason on an account of his poor grades.

A few monthly repayments later, your colleague is laid off, and as a result, he defaults and you find yourself saddled with a new, debilitating liability, as you must repay the residual loan on behalf of your colleague based on debt or loan recovery procedures provided for in the Sacco.\n\nThe above scenario is common in the wake of the Covid-19 pandemic, which, according to data from the Kenya National Bureau of Statistics, has put over 740,000 million Kenyans out of work. The situation has been exacerbated by the many salaried workers who have had to endure pay cuts and furloughs. Worse still, very few jobs are being created in the current context to accommodate those rendered jobless by Covid-19 aftermath.\n\nTraditionally, the deployment of guarantors has been popular among Saccos as a tool for providing security for their various loans. Good prudential practice dictates that Saccos must secure every loan taken out by its members, which means the decision on a loan security is a business or operational decision more than it is legally.\n\nThe law only requires Saccos to put in place mechanisms for loan loss although we are seeing an upsurge of other forms of collaterals being used as security for the loans members take from their Saccos.\n\nBased on the principle of the \u201ccommon bond,\u201d a key principle of the cooperative movement, it has always been easy for members to guarantee each other, as colleagues, as a way of providing security for the loan borrowed. Since the majority of the Sacco members know one another, there is always a way of influencing one another to pay through moral suasion or peer pressure at the workplace.\n\nBut this Sacco and member ecosystem is fast changing. For starters, the wall of exclusivity has been brought down following the opening of the \u201ccommon bond\u201d by most Saccos, thereby opening the membership beyond one employer or even ministry, in the case of most employee based Saccos. As a direct corollary, and inevitably, the concept of collegiality and knowledge of one another is gradually being eroded.\n\nSecondly, with a few Saccos adopting the banking-like, FOSA (Front Office Service Activity) model, they now have not just improved organisational capability and diversified product and service portfolios, but access to additional options for loan security, including incomes received through the FOSA and immovable assets.\n\nThirdly, there have been several policy developments in the credit market in Kenya, enabling lenders, including Saccos, to use additional collaterals besides guarantors. Notable is the legal framework for the sharing of credit information and the Immovable Assets Collateral Registry, all of which provides Saccos with new ways to put in place securities while underwriting loans to their members.\n\nThe fifth factor is the evolution of digital loans, which are on demand products created through partnerships between Saccos and fin-techs (financial technology companies). Through these partnerships, which are already happening in our market, Saccos can collect, collate, and analyse mobile financial transaction data as a basis for assessing the creditworthiness of borrowers.\n\nThe x3, x4 or x5 deposit-based lending model that is popular with Saccos in Kenya almost gives the member a sense of entitlement to a loan. Unfortunately, some members save with the sole purpose of borrowing, regardless of the potential risk of the possibility of changed financial circumstances in future, and if they can raise the required number of guarantors.\n\nAs for Saccos, they will lend taking comfort in the debt recovery policy, which, among other measures, has the list of guarantors as an option for this recovery process \u2013 worth noting is that at times loan processing and disbursement is done without proper due diligence on the borrower\u2019s repayment capacity.

Many Saccos limit the number of loans one can guarantee, which is a good practice.

Then the police came after him, separating him from his six-week-old baby.\n\nThe couple had been married for three years without a child, and the joy of their marriage hit its peak towards the end of 2017 with the arrival of their son, Matisse.\n\nThey had planned to usher in the New Year in style at the quiet ABC Place in Westlands, but as fate would have it, that was not to be.\n\n\u201cDecember 31, 2017, the day we had planned to celebrate our baby, started well. Our Spiritual director, Fr Andrew Massawe of the Congregation of the Holy Cross, who was at that time in Uganda, had fallen ill and urgently needed additional doses of some medication, as the hospital where he was admitted to did not have enough doses. He requested me to send him the medication to Kampala by bus and so in the morning, I went to the Nairobi Hospital and picked up the medicine. Before proceeding to town to send him the parcel, I came back to the house briefly,\u201d Prof Ogolla told Saturday Nation.\n\nWhen his wife noticed that he was preparing to leave, she asked him where he was going and he told her about the parcel.\n\n\u201cShe joked, \u2018Sweetheart, you are going nowhere\u2019. I asked her, \u2018how will you stop me?\u2019 Then she said, \u2018let me show you\u2019, as she romantically pushed me into bed,\u201d he narrated.\n\nIn that playful moment, Prof Ogolla says his wife exclaimed \u2018aha\u2019 and fell at the edge of the bed.\n\n\u201cI took it that she was still playing and escaped the bedroom temptation,\u201d he said.\n\nHeart failure\n\nAfter sending the letter, he said, he communicated with the house help, who told him that Becky was on the floor struggling to get up.\n\n\u201cI got anxious. I rushed back to the house even though, with the city traffic, it was impossible to reach home fast. On arrival, I found her on the floor and immediately called the neighbours, who came and helped me get her into the car and rushed her to hospital.\n\n\u201cI suspected that it was something to do with post-natal issues, as she had given birth a few weeks before, so I rushed her to the hospital where she had earlier delivered \u2013 Aga Khan Hospital. I called her mother and her sister to notify them of the matter,\u201d he explained.\n\nThey arrived at Aga Khan Hospital shortly before 6pm. Becky was taken through emergency checks. All the vital signs were there and her oxygen level was 96 per cent.\n\nAll this time Prof Ogolla was carrying their six-week-old baby, praying and hoping that his wife would get better soon.\n\n\u201cAround 9pm, the nurses told me that she might not be able to breastfeed her son anytime soon and so I should start thinking of alternatives. I was worried as to who would stay with my son at home as I stayed with Becky to monitor her treatment. I once again called Becky\u2019s mother and sister, telling them that the situation was serious and needed their help. Since they could not get the means from Voi to Nairobi that night, her sister promised that they would come to Nairobi the following day,\u201d he said.\n\nProf Ogolla says after all the tests were done on his wife, he rushed home with their child and found some milk in the fridge, which he gave him and put him to sleep. Around 1.30am, as the New Year fireworks lit up the night sky, the doctor called.\n\n\u201cI was needed urgently at Aga Khan Hospital. In a panic, I shared the news with family and friends on a WhatsApp group, requesting them to pray for Becky. On arriving at Aga Khan, I found that Becky had had a heart failure and the doctors were resuscitating her,\u201d he narrated.\n\nHis wife, the doctors said, had fluid in the lungs and blood clots in the heart and the brain, which had caused stroke on the left side of her body. Prof Ogolla sought approval to have her moved to the ICU before going home.\n\nAround 4am, the doctor called once again, informing him that Becky had had her second heart failure as they were moving her to ICU.\n\n\u201cI rushed back to the hospital. By the time I arrived, they had succeeded in resuscitating her the second time. I called our Parish Priest, Fr George Wambua of St Austin\u2019s to come and pray for her. He came and ministered the sacrament of the anointing of the Sick.\u201d\n\nShortly after 9am, on the New Year\u2019s Day 2018, Becky had a third heart failure and unfortunately the doctors were unable to resuscitate her.\n\n\u201cAt 10.30am, the love of my life, Becky, left me and the entire family and friends in a pain that was too deep to bear. I felt hollow. I could not easily accept that she had gone. I didn\u2019t even know how I would take care of our six-week-old baby,\u201d he recalled.\n\nProf Ogolla also had the difficult and painful task of informing family members, friends and those who needed to know of the death, and of arranging for her body to be moved to the mortuary.\n\nFor a body to be moved to the mortuary, a death notice is required. Aga Khan Hospital gave us a letter, which we took to Parklands Police Station and obtained the death notice. I noticed that both the letter from Aga Khan and the death notice indicated she had died of a natural cause.\n\nThe next day, at 6.45am, Prof Ogolla found six police officers at his door. They told him that he had to record a statement at the police station.\n\nDetained for 21 days\n\n\u201cThey said it would not take long and that I needed not even take breakfast first. I followed them to Muthangari Police Station, where I was told I could not leave without authorisation from the Directorate of Criminal Investigations. I spent the next three weeks in the police cells: from Muthangari to Kabete to Capital Hill and so on. Within the 21 days I was detained, I was moved to more than 10 police stations.\n\n\u201cThe police commandant of Nairobi, Mr Japheth Koome, called a press conference and declared me a killer. Then the media, friends, relatives, colleagues and others took different positions. As some pronounced the death penalty on me, others who really knew me stood by me. For nearly two weeks, news headlines were about me. My family was terrified,\u201d he said.\n\nProf Ogolla\u2019s phone and that of his wife were taken for forensic investigations and postmortems were done.\n\nBy the 21st day of his detention, three post-mortems had been done on Becky. Government pathologist Johansen Oduor and Prof Emily Rugena did the three post-mortems separately.\n\nAll the findings held that Becky had died of a natural cause and that there was not a single physical injury on the body, rendering the domestic fight rumour baseless. By this time, the police had concluded their investigations and they, too, found no evidence linking Prof Ogolla to his wife\u2019s death.\n\n\u201cForensic investigations on our phones did not yield any link to the lies peddled through the media, friends, relatives and colleagues. One of the lies was that a woman had allegedly called me, which led to a fight that led to my wife\u2019s death. Another lie was that I did not inform my in-laws of the death and that I was planning to bury my wife as soon as possible,\u201d Prof Ogolla said.\n\nJustice Luka Kimaru released the don on Sh100,000 free bond and pronounced that the prosecutor was free to arrest him in case any evidence emerged within three months. However, he said, if after three months there was no evidence then the case would be closed.\n\n\u201cI was allowed to go home to mourn and bury my beloved wife. I laid her to rest at my home in K\u2019Ogola K\u2019Ongira Farm in Kateg Jera, Ugenya, Siaya County,\u201d he said, adding that to date, there has been no evidence linking him to her death and that he has never been charged.\n\n\u201cUpon realising they had falsely accused me, my in-laws apologised, we buried the hatchet and I forgave them for the pain they had caused. United we put Becky\u2019s soul to rest,\u201d he said, adding that since then, his relationship with his in-laws has again become cordial.\n\n\u201cWe visit one another, share meals and exchange gifts and other things,\u201d he revealed.\n\nProf Ogolla says the death of his wife, under those circumstances, posed the biggest challenge and taught him several lessons.\n\n\u201cI had to accept the bitter truth that I would raise my son on my own. Inasmuch as many people requested me to give them my son to raise him, I could not accept the offer as I felt and still feel this was the most precious gift Becky left me with. Therefore, I have to be there for him and with him.\u201d\n\nHis other lesson, he says, was around people\u2019s ability to misrepresent facts.\n\n\u201cSome media houses reported that I was a 60-year-old man married to a young lady. Little did they know that I got my PhD before reaching 30 and married Becky thereafter. Our relationship started when we were both students, without even a house, and whatever possessions we had were acquired during our relationship.\n\n\u201cThere was also a claim that Becky had a baby with another man, thus creating a fight. However, the DNA test carried out by the police proved that Matisse is my son. Others alleged there was a fight occasioned by a call from a woman. Forensic evidence proved that there was so such call.\u201d\n\nHis brothers and sisters, he said, stood with him during the entire period.\n\n\u201cMy wife was a precious gift. She was a planner, an organiser, a focused and very loving woman. She organised my work, my travels, our family. I lost all that. Earlier, we had discussed how to raise our son. I was pleasantly surprised to discover that she had documented all this. It is her notes that I have been using to raise Matisse to be the son of whom she will be proud when we meet again in Heaven.\u201d BY DAILY NATION", "articleBodyHtml": "<article>\n\n<figure><a href=\"https://1.bp.blogspot.com/-n6xgmQYUhe8/YWFnnL5pA-I/AAAAAAAAUDY/qOiA9HSPeR09HHm4n2tvt_iS-QQBa0HpwCLcBGAsYHQ/s720/fredrick-rebecca.jpg\"><img data-original-height=\"720\" data-original-width=\"720\" src=\"https://1.bp.blogspot.com/-n6xgmQYUhe8/YWFnnL5pA-I/AAAAAAAAUDY/qOiA9HSPeR09HHm4n2tvt_iS-QQBa0HpwCLcBGAsYHQ/s320/fredrick-rebecca.jpg\"></a></figure>\n\n<p>When bad luck chooses you as a companion, even a ripe banana can remove your teeth, so goes an African proverb.</p>\n\n<p>For Prof Fredrick Ogolla, the academic director MBA programmes and the director Institute of Strategy and Competitiveness at Strathmore University, bad luck handpicked him on the very last day of 2017.</p>\n\n<p>He suddenly lost his wife, Rebecca Gombe Mwachongo, fondly referred to as Becky.

Before proceeding to town to send him the parcel, I came back to the house briefly,\u201d Prof Ogolla told\u00a0<em>Saturday Nation</em>.</p>\n\n<p>When his wife noticed that he was preparing to leave, she asked him where he was going and he told her about the parcel.</p>\n\n<p>\u201cShe joked, \u2018Sweetheart, you are going nowhere\u2019. I asked her, \u2018how will you stop me?\u2019 Then she said, \u2018let me show you\u2019, as she romantically pushed me into bed,\u201d he narrated.</p>\n\n<p>In that playful moment, Prof Ogolla says his wife exclaimed \u2018aha\u2019 and fell at the edge of the bed.</p>\n\n<p>\u201cI took it that she was still playing and escaped the bedroom temptation,\u201d he said.</p>\n\n<h2>Heart failure</h2>\n\n<p>After sending the letter, he said, he communicated with the house help, who told him that Becky was on the floor struggling to get up.</p>\n\n<p>\u201cI got anxious. I rushed back to the house even though, with the city traffic, it was impossible to reach home fast. On arrival, I found her on the floor and immediately called the neighbours, who came and helped me get her into the car and rushed her to hospital.</p>\n\n<p>\u201cI suspected that it was something to do with post-natal issues, as she had given birth a few weeks before, so I rushed her to the hospital where she had earlier delivered \u2013 Aga Khan Hospital. I called her mother and her sister to notify them of the matter,\u201d he explained.</p>\n\n<p>They arrived at Aga Khan Hospital shortly before 6pm. Becky was taken through emergency checks. All the vital signs were there and her oxygen level was 96 per cent.</p>\n\n<p>All this time Prof Ogolla was carrying their six-week-old baby, praying and hoping that his wife would get better soon.</p>\n\n<p>\u201cAround 9pm, the nurses told me that she might not be able to breastfeed her son anytime soon and so I should start thinking of alternatives. I was worried as to who would stay with my son at home as I stayed with Becky to monitor her treatment. I once again called Becky\u2019s mother and sister, telling them that the situation was serious and needed their help. Since they could not get the means from Voi to Nairobi that night, her sister promised that they would come to Nairobi the following day,\u201d he said.</p>\n\n<p>Prof Ogolla says after all the tests were done on his wife, he rushed home with their child and found some milk in the fridge, which he gave him and put him to sleep. Around 1.30am, as the New Year fireworks lit up the night sky, the doctor called.</p>\n\n<p>\u201cI was needed urgently at Aga Khan Hospital. In a panic, I shared the news with family and friends on a WhatsApp group, requesting them to pray for Becky. On arriving at Aga Khan, I found that Becky had had a heart failure and the doctors were resuscitating her,\u201d he narrated.</p>\n\n<figure><img alt=\"Rebecca Gombe Mwachongo\" data-lazy-img=\"true\" data-src=\"/resource/image/4810/landscape_ratio2x1/320/160/478cc39a1faca79042a362a83e574174/WK/rebecca-gombe.jpg\" data-srcset=\"\n/resource/image/4810/landscape_ratio2x1/320/160/478cc39a1faca79042a362a83e574174/WK/rebecca-gombe.jpg 320w,\n/resource/image/4810/landscape_ratio2x1/640/320/478cc39a1faca79042a362a83e574174/Bh/rebecca-gombe.jpg 640w,\n/resource/image/4810/landscape_ratio2x1/720/360/478cc39a1faca79042a362a83e574174/Wg/rebecca-gombe.jpg 720w,\n/resource/image/4810/landscape_ratio2x1/960/480/478cc39a1faca79042a362a83e574174/Tl/rebecca-gombe.jpg 960w,\n/resource/image/4810/landscape_ratio2x1/1280/640/478cc39a1faca79042a362a83e574174/PP/rebecca-gombe.jpg 1280w\n\" sizes=\"(min-width: 820px) 820px, (min-width: 630px) 630px, 100vw\" src=\"https://nation.africa/resource/image/4810/landscape_ratio2x1/320/160/478cc39a1faca79042a362a83e574174/WK/rebecca-gombe.jpg\" srcset=\"\n/resource/image/4810/landscape_ratio2x1/320/160/478cc39a1faca79042a362a83e574174/WK/rebecca-gombe.jpg 320w,\n/resource/image/4810/landscape_ratio2x1/640/320/478cc39a1faca79042a362a83e574174/Bh/rebecca-gombe.jpg 640w,\n/resource/image/4810/landscape_ratio2x1/720/360/478cc39a1faca79042a362a83e574174/Wg/rebecca-gombe.jpg 720w,\n/resource/image/4810/landscape_ratio2x1/960/480/478cc39a1faca79042a362a83e574174/Tl/rebecca-gombe.jpg 960w,\n/resource/image/4810/landscape_ratio2x1/1280/640/478cc39a1faca79042a362a83e574174/PP/rebecca-gombe.jpg 1280w\n\"><figcaption><p>The late Rebecca Gombe Mwachongo, the wife of Strathmore University lecturer Fredrick Onyango Ogolla.\u00a0</p>Courtesy</figcaption></figure>\n\n<p>His wife, the doctors said, had fluid in the lungs and blood clots in the heart and the brain, which had caused stroke on the left side of her body. Prof Ogolla sought approval to have her moved to the ICU before going home.</p>\n\n<p>Around 4am, the doctor called once again, informing him that Becky had had her second heart failure as they were moving her to ICU.</p>\n\n<p>\u201cI rushed back to the hospital. By the time I arrived, they had succeeded in resuscitating her the second time. I called our Parish Priest, Fr George Wambua of St Austin\u2019s to come and pray for her. He came and ministered the sacrament of the anointing of the Sick.\u201d</p>\n\n<p>Shortly after 9am, on the New Year\u2019s Day 2018, Becky had a third heart failure and unfortunately the doctors were unable to resuscitate her.</p>\n\n<p>\u201cAt 10.30am, the love of my life, Becky, left me and the entire family and friends in a pain that was too deep to bear. I felt hollow. I could not easily accept that she had gone. I didn\u2019t even know how I would take care of our six-week-old baby,\u201d he recalled.</p>\n\n<p>Prof Ogolla also had the difficult and painful task of informing family members, friends and those who needed to know of the death, and of arranging for her body to be moved to the mortuary.</p>\n\n<p>For a body to be moved to the mortuary, a death notice is required. Aga Khan Hospital gave us a letter, which we took to Parklands Police Station and obtained the death notice. I noticed that both the letter from Aga Khan and the death notice indicated she had died of a natural cause.</p>\n\n<p>The next day, at 6.45am, Prof Ogolla found six police officers at his door. They told him that he had to record a statement at the police station.</p>\n\n<h2>Detained for 21 days</h2>\n\n<p>\u201cThey said it would not take long and that I needed not even take breakfast first. I followed them to Muthangari Police Station, where I was told I could not leave without authorisation from the Directorate of Criminal Investigations. I spent the next three weeks in the police cells: from Muthangari to Kabete to Capital Hill and so on. Within the 21 days I was detained, I was moved to more than 10 police stations.</p>\n\n<p>\u201cThe police commandant of Nairobi, Mr Japheth Koome, called a press conference and declared me a killer. Then the media, friends, relatives, colleagues and others took different positions. As some pronounced the death penalty on me, others who really knew me stood by me. For nearly two weeks, news headlines were about me. My family was terrified,\u201d he said.</p>\n\n<p>Prof Ogolla\u2019s phone and that of his wife were taken for forensic investigations and postmortems were done.</p>\n\n<p>By the 21st day of his detention, three post-mortems had been done on Becky. Government pathologist Johansen Oduor and Prof Emily Rugena did the three post-mortems separately.</p>\n\n<p>All the findings held that Becky had died of a natural cause and that there was not a single physical injury on the body, rendering the domestic fight rumour baseless. By this time, the police had concluded their investigations and they, too, found no evidence linking Prof Ogolla to his wife\u2019s death.</p>\n\n<p>\u201cForensic investigations on our phones did not yield any link to the lies peddled through the media, friends, relatives and colleagues. One of the lies was that a woman had allegedly called me, which led to a fight that led to my wife\u2019s death. Another lie was that I did not inform my in-laws of the death and that I was planning to bury my wife as soon as possible,\u201d Prof Ogolla said.</p>\n\n<p>Justice Luka Kimaru released the don on Sh100,000 free bond and pronounced that the prosecutor was free to arrest him in case any evidence emerged within three months. However, he said, if after three months there was no evidence then the case would be closed.</p>\n\n<p>\u201cI was allowed to go home to mourn and bury my beloved wife. I laid her to rest at my home in K\u2019Ogola K\u2019Ongira Farm in Kateg Jera, Ugenya, Siaya County,\u201d he said, adding that to date, there has been no evidence linking him to her death and that he has never been charged.</p>\n\n<figure><img alt=\"Fredrick Onyango Ogolla\" data-lazy-img=\"true\" data-src=\"/resource/image/1251440/landscape_ratio2x1/320/160/f7d287f23ac22e05e9c565a07d1aacd5/Bd/fredrick-onyango-ogolla.jpg\" data-srcset=\"\n/resource/image/1251440/landscape_ratio2x1/320/160/f7d287f23ac22e05e9c565a07d1aacd5/Bd/fredrick-onyango-ogolla.jpg 320w,\n/resource/image/1251440/landscape_ratio2x1/640/320/f7d287f23ac22e05e9c565a07d1aacd5/NQ/fredrick-onyango-ogolla.jpg 640w,\n/resource/image/1251440/landscape_ratio2x1/720/360/f7d287f23ac22e05e9c565a07d1aacd5/LL/fredrick-onyango-ogolla.jpg 720w,\n/resource/image/1251440/landscape_ratio2x1/960/480/f7d287f23ac22e05e9c565a07d1aacd5/ds/fredrick-onyango-ogolla.jpg 960w,\n/resource/image/1251440/landscape_ratio2x1/1280/640/f7d287f23ac22e05e9c565a07d1aacd5/ka/fredrick-onyango-ogolla.jpg 1280w\n\" sizes=\"(min-width: 820px) 820px, (min-width: 630px) 630px, 100vw\" src=\"https://nation.africa/resource/image/1251440/landscape_ratio2x1/320/160/f7d287f23ac22e05e9c565a07d1aacd5/Bd/fredrick-onyango-ogolla.jpg\" srcset=\"\n/resource/image/1251440/landscape_ratio2x1/320/160/f7d287f23ac22e05e9c565a07d1aacd5/Bd/fredrick-onyango-ogolla.jpg 320w,\n/resource/image/1251440/landscape_ratio2x1/640/320/f7d287f23ac22e05e9c565a07d1aacd5/NQ/fredrick-onyango-ogolla.jpg 640w,\n/resource/image/1251440/landscape_ratio2x1/720/360/f7d287f23ac22e05e9c565a07d1aacd5/LL/fredrick-onyango-ogolla.jpg 720w,\n/resource/image/1251440/landscape_ratio2x1/960/480/f7d287f23ac22e05e9c565a07d1aacd5/ds/fredrick-onyango-ogolla.jpg 960w,\n/resource/image/1251440/landscape_ratio2x1/1280/640/f7d287f23ac22e05e9c565a07d1aacd5/ka/fredrick-onyango-ogolla.jpg 1280w\n\"><figcaption><p>Strathmore University lecturer Fredrick Onyango Ogolla when he appeared before the Kibera Law Courts on January 3, 2018 after he was arrested following the death of his wife.</p>Benson Matheka | Nation Media Group</figcaption></figure>\n\n<p>\u201cUpon realising they had falsely accused me, my in-laws apologised, we buried the hatchet and I forgave them for the pain they had caused. United we put Becky\u2019s soul to rest,\u201d he said, adding that since then, his relationship with his in-laws has again become cordial.</p>\n\n<p>\u201cWe visit one another, share meals and exchange gifts and other things,\u201d he revealed.</p>\n\n<p>Prof Ogolla says the death of his wife, under those circumstances, posed the biggest challenge and taught him several lessons.</p>\n\n<p>\u201cI had to accept the bitter truth that I would raise my son on my own. Inasmuch as many people requested me to give them my son to raise him, I could not accept the offer as I felt and still feel this was the most precious gift Becky left me with. Therefore, I have to be there for him and with him.\u201d</p>\n\n<p>His other lesson, he says, was around people\u2019s ability to misrepresent facts.</p>\n\n<p>\u201cSome media houses reported that I was a 60-year-old man married to a young lady. Little did they know that I got my PhD before reaching 30 and married Becky thereafter. Our relationship started when we were both students, without even a house, and whatever possessions we had were acquired during our relationship.</p>\n\n<p>\u201cThere was also a claim that Becky had a baby with another man, thus creating a fight. However, the DNA test carried out by the police proved that Matisse is my son. Others alleged there was a fight occasioned by a call from a woman. Forensic evidence proved that there was so such call.\u201d</p>\n\n<p>His brothers and sisters, he said, stood with him during the entire period.</p>\n\n<p>\u201cMy wife was a precious gift. She was a planner, an organiser, a focused and very loving woman. She organised my work, my travels, our family. I lost all that. Earlier, we had discussed how to raise our son. I was pleasantly surprised to discover that she had documented all this. It is her notes that I have been using to raise Matisse to be the son of whom she will be proud when we meet again in Heaven.\u201d\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0BY DAILY NATION</p>\n\n</article>", "canonicalUrl": "https://www.breakingkenyanews.com/2021/10/lecturer-falsely-accused-of-killing.html"},{"url": "https://www.breakingkenyanews.com/2018/03/barclays-launches-mobile-loan-app.html", "probability": 0.9068798, "headline": "Barclays launches mobile loan app", "datePublished": "2018-03-17T00:00:00", "datePublishedRaw": "March 17, 2018", "dateModified": "2018-03-17T15:00:47+00:00", "dateModifiedRaw": "2018-03-17T15:00:47Z", "author": "Breaking Kenya news", "authorsList": ["Breaking Kenya news"], "inLanguage": "en", "breadcrumbs": [{"name": "Home", "link": "https://www.breakingkenyanews.com/"}, {"name": "Unlabelled"}, {"name": "Barclays launches mobile loan app"}], "mainImage": "https://www.nation.co.ke/image/view/-/4345592/medRes/1911385/-/maxw/600/-/l597l0/-/AWORI.jpg", "description": " Breaking news, kenya news, county news, politics, business, sports, lifestyle and entertainment from Kenya and around the world", "articleBody": "Barclays Bank of Kenya has launched a new mobile loans service dubbed Timiza, increasing the competition in the lucrative micro lending segment.\n\nTimiza is entering a crowded field of commercial bank-backed lending apps such as M-Shwari, Equitel, M-Co-op Cash, and KCB M-Pesa.\n\nThe lender said customers can access micro loans of between Sh100 and Sh150,000 from the platform at interest rates of 1.17 per cent monthly and one-off facilitation fee of 5 per cent.

I had connected with her and had secretly nicknamed her Peace. Unlike my previous pregnancies, hers was the most peaceful. Effortless. For the first time, my blood pressure was stable and I was sure she would be home eventually. Unfortunately, we lost her at five months and two weeks,\u201d gospel musician Linet Munyali, whose stage name is Size 8, tells Healthy Nation.\n\nOn October 1 this year, Instagram users globally updated their timelines as usual. Size 8 and her husband Samuel Muraya alias DJ Mo had two sad successive video updates on the same platform, which they posted concurrently. The first was a nine-second clip which promoted a YouTube video that was to premier at 2.30pm on their channel (the Murayas) that day. The video started with a close-up shot of a blood pressure monitor whose systolic number (the upper reading) was 213. And then a frail Size 8 was introduced, singing an old Sunday school song; Yes, Jesus loves me\u2026\n\n\u201cIt is painful, but God is on the throne,\u201d a seemingly dejected DJ Mo said in the video, rubbing his eyes with his hands.\n\nThe next post, a 26-second video, had a victorious undertone. While Size 8 was still in the theatre, she acknowledged that she was grateful for a second chance of life \u2013to take care of her two children and to preach the Gospel.\n\nHealthy Nation caught up with Size 8 and for the first time, she openly talks about the lows of pregnancy loss in a national newspaper.\n\n\u201cI have lost two pregnancies, the first baby (my second born) was only 12 weeks and the second had clocked five months and two weeks,\u201d she says.\n\n\u201cWe didn\u2019t get any explanation when we lost the first baby. The doctors could not find its heartbeat. The baby had stopped growing, and we were told it was a blighted ovum,\u201d she adds\n\nA blighted ovum occurs when the gestational sac and placenta grow, but there is no embryo (the earliest form of a baby\u2019s development in a womb).\n\nThe second loss and most recent was unforeseen. After a peaceful five months, her blood pressure shot up, and her alarm bells rang loudly when she could no longer feel her baby moving.\n\n\u201cI had a rough journey with my first born. My blood pressure shot up to 167, (a normal blood pressure should read less than 120/80 millimetres of mercury). At 36 weeks, we had to have an emergency caesarean-section and she was born,\u201d she tells Healthy Nation.\n\nWhen she lost her second baby as a blighted ovum, she tried again, and was blessed with a son. However, she details that carrying him set her on a dramatic journey that required her to take a total bed rest at two months of pregnancy.\n\n\u201cI had to take a total bed rest because I had an acute stroke. I wasn\u2019t sure that I would carry him to term. God reassured me despite me visiting the hospital twice a week,\u201d she says.\n\nAt 32 weeks, she received a lung injection to support the growth of the baby\u2019s lungs. Two weeks later, there was an unusual calm in her stomach. No kicks, no turns, just silence.\n\nHer blood pressure shot up to 180. When she went to hospital, she was told that the baby\u2019s pressure, too, had gone up.\n\n\u201cThis time I had fits (an unusual condition during pregnancy where high blood pressure results in seizures) and so I was given magnesium to stabilise me. My oxygen levels had dropped, that means I had to be on oxygen as well,\u201d she explains.\n\nAt 34 weeks, she again had to undergo an emergency cesarean-section to save herself and the baby.\nModerately premature\n\nThe baby was moderately premature and had to be incubated for a while. Three days post-delivery, she did not set her eyes on her baby.\n\n\u201cOn the third night, I kept praying and praising God for my son. I had just got out of the washroom when I heard the Holy Spirit telling me to go to the Intensive Care Unit to see him. Upon reaching there, I found doctors surrounding him and figured that something was wrong. The Holy Spirit again instructed me to place my palm on his chest, and speak life into him. This may sound like fiction, but he stabilised soon after,\u201d she tells Healthy Nation.\n\nHer blood pressure was still high but her baby was as healthy as a horse. He is a two-year-old boy now, and Size 8 calls him her living miracle.\n\nAbout two months and two weeks ago, carrying her fourth born, she learnt that she was going to have a stillbirth. Her baby had succumbed to high blood pressure, and the distraught mother wept for her dearest child for more than 24 hours.\n\n\u201cI was to be admitted that night but I protested. I had already lost the one in the womb, my blood pressure was at an all-time high, and I knew that there was a possibility of losing my life on the surgical table. I wanted to see my son and daughter desperately should I fail to go back home,\u201d she says\n\n\u201cI went home that night and held my children\u2019s hands and prayed, crying. They didn\u2019t know why I was crying. I was just afraid that I couldn\u2019t come back from the hospital.\u201d\n\nThe next day she went to the hospital and her blood pressure was still high, at 213. Going to the surgery room in that state was a no-win-situation.\n\n\u201cI was battling high blood pressure on my own, but it was also worse due to the dead baby in the womb. The pressure wouldn\u2019t subside. I was at a risk of dying with the baby still in the womb, and I also risked dying on the operation table due to blood loss. In the theatre, I was surrounded by specialists, and my surgeon was amazingly fast and efficient. Taking the shortest time possible to remove the baby and stitch me up gave them a chance at saving my life. I was then wheeled to the high dependency unit for monitoring.\n\n\u201cAt the table, I cried to God telling Him to spare my life. I reminded Him that I had delivered my other two children in agony, and that I wanted to be alive to raise them up,\u201d she explains.\n\nEven though she had already bonded with her little girl and even given her a nickname, she figured she would not be able to move on if she lay her eyes on her. Her doctors asked if she was sure, and she reinstated her position. Her husband ,however, agreed and had a chance to see the beauty he would unfortunately never get to raise.\n\nSize 8\u2019s pressure after the surgery plummeted to about 189. By the time she was being discharged, it was at 155.\n\n\u201cI have never had a quicker recovery than I had this time. In a week I was okay. I didn\u2019t cry anymore. People even thought that I was in denial. I had faced death, but I was grateful that God had kept me alive for my two babies,\u201d she narrates.\n\nSize 8 dismisses the rumours that her baby was a mistake. \u201cNo baby comes unplanned. It is just that a contraceptive method I was using failed.\u201d\n\nDoctors have told her there is an organ in her system that fails when she gets pregnant, which contributes to the high blood pressure she experiences.\n\nThe high-energy singer recalls that her toughest moment following her recent loss was going back home and having no words to tell her first-born daughter that the baby was dead and wouldn\u2019t be coming home.\n\n\u201cMy daughter thought I had gone to deliver and when we got home, she rushed to the car asking to see the baby. Seeing her in that situation broke my heart, and I was unable to respond. Later, I told her that Jesus had taken the baby because she doesn\u2019t understand death yet. I will explain it well when she gets older,\u201d says Size 8.\n\nShe is also empathetic towards her husband, who, according to her, was hardest hit by the loss of the baby and his wife\u2019s near-death experience.\n\n\u201cI try to imagine myself in his shoes and I don\u2019t think I would be able to bear that pain. He was deeply affected but he has a masking mechanism that doesn\u2019t let us see his pain. He behaves normally now, so I figure he is okay,\u201d she explains.\nFirst pregnancy\n\nDr Maureen Owiti, an obstetrician-gynaecologist at Kenyatta National Hospital, details that pre-eclampsia is a medical condition in pregnancy associated with high blood pressure and complications to other organs. It mainly occurs during a first pregnancy.\n\nBut it can also happen in subsequent pregnancies and once the baby is born, the blood pressure goes back to normal, she notes.\n\n\u201cWe do not know what causes pre-eclampsia. What is stipulated is that there is a defective formation of the placenta that contributes to the same. Most people are asymptomatic in the early stages and it can only be detected by taking a blood pressure measurement. But in people who have severe cases, they may present with headache, pain in the upper part of the abdomen, and in very bad cases, the patient may have visual disturbances. They will have blurred vision, and can see things like stars,\u201d explains Dr Owiti.\n\nShe explains that very young and very old mothers are at risk, as well as mothers with pre-existing conditions such as diabetes and hypertension. Those with multiple gestations (more than one baby in the womb, say twins or triplets) are also at risk.\n\n\u201cFor some people, their blood pressure spikes with every subsequent pregnancy, but it\u2019s related to age, and varies from person to person. If someone has been getting good medical care, and they know that they had pre-eclampsia in their previous pregnancy, they are given aspirin and calcium early in the pregnancy to delay the onset of the symptoms and make the symptoms less severe,\u201d explains the gynaecologist.\n\nThe condition, says Dr Owiti, affects about 10 per cent of the pregnant population, and can progress to eclampsia, a severe condition which is characterised by fits.\n\n\u201cEclampsia is the first complication that we try to avoid for all mothers as well as organ failure. A patient can get renal failure, liver failure, bleeding of the brain, neurological deficit and pulmonary failure and distress. It can also lead to death for the baby, mother or both,\u201d explains Dr Owiti.\n\n\u201cPre-eclampsia can only be managed by doing early ultrasounds at 16 weeks for the doctors to find out whether a pregnant woman is likely to get the condition. If likely, this is when we give calcium and aspirin to manage the symptoms. We cannot prevent pre-eclampsia entirely,\u201d she adds.\n\nShe recommends that if women get preconception care before trying for a baby, and pregnant women get antenatal care, many complications that arise during pregnancy can be prevented.\n\nDr Brian Maugo, a neonatologist and lecturer at the University of Nairobi, tells Healthy Nation that pre-eclampsia is a major cause for babies born prematurely.\n\n\u201cPre-eclampsia puts the mother at risk because of the high blood pressure and sometimes they have to give birth earlier . This means that the baby may not have achieved full growth hence classified as premature,\u201d Dr Maugo explains.\n\nDr Maugo advises that pregnant mothers should religiously go for the antenatal clinic visits, which will help in pointing out if there is an issue with the baby.\n\n\u201cWhen a mother notices regression in terms of growth when the baby is still in the womb, say, they could be losing weight or stagnating, they need to go for a check-up.\n\n\u201cKenyatta National Hospital has a high risk clinic for such cases and adopting it countrywide will help in saving many lives.\u201d\n\nThere is no national data by the Ministry of Health on women in Kenya with pre-eclampsia or eclampsia to help us understand the scope of its proliferation in the country.\n\nThe World Health Organization (WHO) recommends improving care for women during pregnancy and around the time of childbirth to prevent and treat pre-eclampsia and eclampsia in order to achieve health targets of the Sustainable Development Goals.\n\n\u201cEfforts to prevent and reduce morbidity and mortality due to these conditions can help address the profound inequities in maternal and perinatal health globally. To achieve this, healthcare providers, health managers, policy makers and other stakeholders need up-to-date and evidence-informed recommendations to guide clinical policies and practices,\u201d says WHO.

I had connected with her and had secretly nicknamed her Peace. Unlike my previous pregnancies, hers was the most peaceful. Effortless. For the first time, my blood pressure was stable and I was sure she would be home eventually. Unfortunately, we lost her at five months and two weeks,\u201d gospel musician Linet Munyali, whose stage name is Size 8, tells Healthy Nation.</p>\n\n<p>On October 1 this year, Instagram users globally updated their timelines as usual. Size 8 and her husband Samuel Muraya alias DJ Mo had two sad successive video updates on the same platform, which they posted concurrently. The first was a nine-second clip which promoted a YouTube video that was to premier at 2.30pm on their channel (the Murayas) that day. The video started with a close-up shot of a blood pressure monitor whose systolic number (the upper reading) was 213. And then a frail Size 8 was introduced, singing an old Sunday school song; Yes, Jesus loves me\u2026</p>\n\n<p>\u201cIt is painful, but God is on the throne,\u201d a seemingly dejected DJ Mo said in the video, rubbing his eyes with his hands.</p>\n\n<p>The next post, a 26-second video, had a victorious undertone. While Size 8 was still in the theatre, she acknowledged that she was grateful for a second chance of life \u2013to take care of her two children and to preach the Gospel.</p>\n\n<p>Healthy Nation caught up with Size 8 and for the first time, she openly talks about the lows of pregnancy loss in a national newspaper.</p>\n\n<p>\u201cI have lost two pregnancies, the first baby (my second born) was only 12 weeks and the second had clocked five months and two weeks,\u201d she says.</p>\n\n<p>\u201cWe didn\u2019t get any explanation when we lost the first baby. The doctors could not find its heartbeat. The baby had stopped growing, and we were told it was a blighted ovum,\u201d she adds</p>\n\n<p>A blighted ovum occurs when the gestational sac and placenta grow, but there is no embryo (the earliest form of a baby\u2019s development in a womb).</p>\n\n<p>The second loss and most recent was unforeseen. After a peaceful five months, her blood pressure shot up, and her alarm bells rang loudly when she could no longer feel her baby moving.</p>\n\n<p>\u201cI had a rough journey with my first born. My blood pressure shot up to 167, (a normal blood pressure should read less than 120/80 millimetres of mercury). At 36 weeks, we had to have an emergency caesarean-section and she was born,\u201d she tells Healthy Nation.</p>\n\n<p>When she lost her second baby as a blighted ovum, she tried again, and was blessed with a son. However, she details that carrying him set her on a dramatic journey that required her to take a total bed rest at two months of pregnancy.</p>\n\n<p>\u201cI had to take a total bed rest because I had an acute stroke. I wasn\u2019t sure that I would carry him to term. God reassured me despite me visiting the hospital twice a week,\u201d she says.</p>\n\n<p>At 32 weeks, she received a lung injection to support the growth of the baby\u2019s lungs. Two weeks later, there was an unusual calm in her stomach. No kicks, no turns, just silence.</p>\n\n<p>Her blood pressure shot up to 180. When she went to hospital, she was told that the baby\u2019s pressure, too, had gone up.</p>\n\n<p>\u201cThis time I had fits (an unusual condition during pregnancy where high blood pressure results in seizures) and so I was given magnesium to stabilise me. My oxygen levels had dropped, that means I had to be on oxygen as well,\u201d she explains.</p>\n\n<p>At 34 weeks, she again had to undergo an emergency cesarean-section to save herself and the baby.<br>Moderately premature</p>\n\n<p>The baby was moderately premature and had to be incubated for a while. Three days post-delivery, she did not set her eyes on her baby.</p>\n\n<p>\u201cOn the third night, I kept praying and praising God for my son. I had just got out of the washroom when I heard the Holy Spirit telling me to go to the Intensive Care Unit to see him. Upon reaching there, I found doctors surrounding him and figured that something was wrong. The Holy Spirit again instructed me to place my palm on his chest, and speak life into him. This may sound like fiction, but he stabilised soon after,\u201d she tells Healthy Nation.</p>\n\n<p>Her blood pressure was still high but her baby was as healthy as a horse. He is a two-year-old boy now, and Size 8 calls him her living miracle.</p>\n\n<p>About two months and two weeks ago, carrying her fourth born, she learnt that she was going to have a stillbirth. Her baby had succumbed to high blood pressure, and the distraught mother wept for her dearest child for more than 24 hours.</p>\n\n<p>\u201cI was to be admitted that night but I protested. I had already lost the one in the womb, my blood pressure was at an all-time high, and I knew that there was a possibility of losing my life on the surgical table. I wanted to see my son and daughter desperately should I fail to go back home,\u201d she says</p>\n\n<p>\u201cI went home that night and held my children\u2019s hands and prayed, crying. They didn\u2019t know why I was crying. I was just afraid that I couldn\u2019t come back from the hospital.\u201d</p>\n\n<p>The next day she went to the hospital and her blood pressure was still high, at 213. Going to the surgery room in that state was a no-win-situation.</p>\n\n<p>\u201cI was battling high blood pressure on my own, but it was also worse due to the dead baby in the womb. The pressure wouldn\u2019t subside. I was at a risk of dying with the baby still in the womb, and I also risked dying on the operation table due to blood loss. In the theatre, I was surrounded by specialists, and my surgeon was amazingly fast and efficient. Taking the shortest time possible to remove the baby and stitch me up gave them a chance at saving my life. I was then wheeled to the high dependency unit for monitoring.</p>\n\n<p>\u201cAt the table, I cried to God telling Him to spare my life.

Her doctors asked if she was sure, and she reinstated her position. Her husband ,however, agreed and had a chance to see the beauty he would unfortunately never get to raise.</p>\n\n<p>Size 8\u2019s pressure after the surgery plummeted to about 189.

Let us agree that we shall never refer to the past ...\u201d\n\nIn 1968, in his book, Suffering without Bitterness, Jomo expounded on his \u201cforgive and forget\u201d philosophy: \u201cThe foundation of our future must lie in the theme: forgive and forget. There was no point then (1964), and there is still less purpose today, in dwelling on the past, in stoking fires of revenge or animosity, in looking back on scenes of anguish.\u201d\n\nWhile Jomo saw memorialising of freedom movement activities \u2013 or showcasing these scenes of anguish \u2013 as divisive, President Kenyatta has looked at history as the unifying force and a central pillar in the creation of a national identity.\n\nUhuru Park\n\nWhile Jomo \u2013 and subsequent governments \u2013 had preserved Uhuru Gardens as a site of memory, it became one of the lesser-known sites overshadowed by the less-historical Uhuru Park.\n\n\u201cBy creating this garden as a place of remembrance, our founding fathers brought us to this place of national remembrance. Each time we gather here, they wanted us to face our national fears and demons with courage,\u201d said Mr Kenyatta on Saturday.\n\nBut the Lang\u2019ata grounds had over the years lost all memories and traces of pre-independence history, with the government giving the park a wide berth and leaving it to picnic lovers. That way, the memory and narrative of its traumatic past has been diluted and the monuments at the park marking the site where the Kenyan flag was first raised and commemorating 25 years of independence have not helped to preserve the memories of the Lang\u2019ata camp.\n\nDealing with what historians call \u2018places of pain\u2019 as part of heritage has been an on-going debate for the last 56 years in Kenya. While governments have been shy, nay apprehensive, of unearthing certain histories, how a nation confronts the past is the hallmark of freedom.\n\nAt independence, some of the Mau Mau detention camps were easily handed over to churches to build schools, thus erasing the country\u2019s memory.

Even the Hola massacre site was turned into a girls\u2019 secondary school \u2013 rather than preserve it as a record of the freedom struggle.\n\nFor the past 10 years, the country has been struggling to recognise the roles played by independent heroes, both radicals and moderates, to contextualise Kenya\u2019s history.\n\nKenya\u2019s third President, Mwai Kibaki, had started by unveiling the statue of Dedan Kimathi and recognising graves of various freedom fighters as national monuments.\n\nBut it was the place of Lang\u2019ata that was always intriguing \u2013 because the construction of its history had deliberately been diluted.\n\nFollowing the onset of Operation Anvil on the night of April 24, 1954, the Lang\u2019ata camp was turned into the largest concentration yard and it is estimated that more than 24,000 Kikuyu, Embu and Meru went through the screening \u2013 and most of them were detained.\n\nThis is the place where informers, dressed in long hooded cloaks, would help identify the suspected Mau supporters. Within a month, most of these had been taken to MacKinnon Road detention camp or the nearby Manyani, which was holding an estimated 17,000 detainees. British army major Frank Kitson, who oversaw the screening, would later admit that evidence against the detainees was minimal.\n\nPictures taken at the colonial Lang\u2019ata camp, showing frightened inmates subdued by the British, and squatting in the sun with hands up, capture the inhumanity of the \u2018British Gulag\u2019 in Kenya.\n\nIn the British Parliament, Lang\u2019ata Detention Camp started to feature as moderate legislators started to question the detention of women and children.

She reported that during Operation Anvil, \u201cTroops went into all African locations in Nairobi, rounded up all the African adults and took them to (Lang\u2019ata). No one gave a thought to the children and as long as 48 hours after, tiny babies were found in cots who had no care, attention or food during the whole of that time.\u201d\n\nIt was when she visited Lang\u2019ata that she found something close to camps she had seen in World War II. Lang\u2019ata stood in a class of its own:\n\n\u201cThe officer on duty asked me which \u201cPens\u201d I wanted to visit first and this word \u201cPen\u201d set the scene for me. I have seen cattle markets in England, and places where animals are loaded on lorries to take them to slaughter houses, where the treatment was better than that accorded human beings in this camp -- humans, moreover, who as yet were innocent, merely being detained on suspicion,\u201d she wrote before she quit.\n\n\u201cThe camp consisted of old tents, and was divided into compounds holding several hundred people each, enclosed with barbed wire. The whole camp was also surrounded by barbed wire and high watch towers like a prisoner of war camp. As Mau Mau war is called an emergency, these Africans, held in British territory without trial, had not the rights to which they would have been entitled as prisoners of war.\u201d\n\nSome broke down in all these camps and got mentally ill and Miss Fletcher recounted seeing \u201ca truck containing about 12 African lunatics, accompanied by armed guards, who were being sent to a mental hospital. They were making an appalling noise, shouting, gesticulating and grimacing. The officer, who was second in command at the gaol said he was glad to get rid of them as they had been a disturbing element in the prison for a whole year.\u201d\n\nHow to capture those pains in a national memory was the difference between President Uhuru Kenyatta and Jomo.\n\nTricky balance\n\nJomo, unlike his son, was in a tricky balance.

Hamilton had anticipated the move and positioned his car to take the outside of the turn but with Verstappen fully crowding him out, he opted for the run-off area which meant he maintained the lead.\n\nRed Bull protested but the Stewards were firm that the Dutchman had left no room for Hamilton.\n\nAlthough Verstappen was on soft tyres compared to Hamilton on the mediums, the Red Bull did not have the pace to catch the Mercedes.\n\nHamilton was consistently stretching the gap. Red Bull opted to pit Verstappen early and keep Sergio Perez out.\n\nVerstappen came in on the 14th lap for a set of hards that could last to the end of the race. Mercedes immediately responded by pitting Hamilton a lap later.\n\nDespite dropping to second place, behind Perez, the seven-time world champion maintained his comfortable lead over Verstappen, who was now fourth behind the Ferrari of Carlos Sainz.\n\nOn the 19th lap, Hamilton was right at the gearbox of Perez, with Verstappen a further eight seconds behind. The Mexican put in a brilliant defense as Hamilton tried to find a way through.\n\nHamilton passed Perez before the Red Bull driver recovered the position through the use of DRS. The Brit kept up the pressure and when he finally managed to pass the Red Bull, Verstappen had reduced the deficit to less than two seconds.\n\nWorse for Hamilton, Verstappen got DRS assistance from Perez, with the Mexican swiftly letting his teammate by to continue the chase on the 21st lap of the 58-lap race.\n\nFive laps later, Kimi Raikkonen\u2019s Formula One career, comprised of 349 races with 21 wins, came to an end when his Alfa Romeo suffered a technical issue, causing him to skid off and gently hit the barriers.\n\nThe 2007 world champion mastered his experience to nurse it back to the pits.\n\nIt went from bad to worse for Alfa Romeo as Antonio Giovinazzi, for whom the race might have been his last in Formula One, had to retire on the 35th lap on account of a power unit issue.\n\nHe parked his car at a run-off area which prompted a Virtual Safety Car. Verstappen pitted and got new set of hard tyres.\n\nHe was now 17 seconds behind the race leader with 20 laps to go. The Dutchman set about closing the gap and set a number of fastest laps, but he was not reducing the deficit by the amount needed to mount a challenge on Hamilton at the end of the race.\n\nIt seemed as if Hamilton would cruise to an eighth title and even Red Bull's Team Principal, Christian Horner, deemed that only a miracle could hand the title over to them.\n\nMinutes after that wish, Williams\u2019 Latifi crashed at Turn Fourteen with only five laps to go, seconds after a tussle with the Haas of Mick Schumacher.\n\nHamilton was 12 seconds ahead of Verstappen with three lapped cars lying between the two at the time of crash.\n\nWith nothing to lose, Red Bull opted to pit Verstappen. It meant that there would be five lapped cars between him and Hamilton.\n\nThere were only three laps to go and the question was whether all the lapped cars would be allowed to unlap themselves, as per the norm.\n\nThis would take time and had the potential of making the race end under the Safety Car.\n\nMeanwhile, Perez was ordered to pit in order to retire the car, coming as a huge disappointment after his valiant effort to give his teammate a sling shot to victory by holding back Hamilton for as long as possible.\n\nOn the penultimate lap, Horner asked Masi about the decision not to allow lapped cars to unlap themselves.\n\nMasi replied that he was assessing the situation.

Hamilton had anticipated the move and positioned his car to take the outside of the turn but with Verstappen fully crowding him out, he opted for the run-off area which meant he maintained the lead.</p>\n\n<p>Red Bull protested but the Stewards were firm that the Dutchman had left no room for Hamilton.</p>\n\n<p>Although Verstappen was on soft tyres compared to Hamilton on the mediums, the Red Bull did not have the pace to catch the Mercedes.</p>\n\n<p>Hamilton was consistently stretching the gap. Red Bull opted to pit Verstappen early and keep Sergio Perez out.</p>\n\n<p>Verstappen came in on the 14th lap for a set of hards that could last to the end of the race. Mercedes immediately responded by pitting Hamilton a lap later.</p>\n\n<p>Despite dropping to second place, behind Perez, the seven-time world champion maintained his comfortable lead over Verstappen, who was now fourth behind the Ferrari of Carlos Sainz.</p>\n\n<p>On the 19th lap, Hamilton was right at the gearbox of Perez, with Verstappen a further eight seconds behind. The Mexican put in a brilliant defense as Hamilton tried to find a way through.</p>\n\n<p>Hamilton passed Perez before the Red Bull driver recovered the position through the use of DRS. The Brit kept up the pressure and when he finally managed to pass the Red Bull, Verstappen had reduced the deficit to less than two seconds.</p>\n\n<p>Worse for Hamilton, Verstappen got DRS assistance from Perez, with the Mexican swiftly letting his teammate by to continue the chase on the 21st lap of the 58-lap race.</p>\n\n<p>Five laps later, Kimi Raikkonen\u2019s Formula One career, comprised of 349 races with 21 wins, came to an end when his Alfa Romeo suffered a technical issue, causing him to skid off and gently hit the barriers.</p>\n\n<p>The 2007 world champion mastered his experience to nurse it back to the pits.</p>\n\n<p>It went from bad to worse for Alfa Romeo as Antonio Giovinazzi, for whom the race might have been his last in Formula One, had to retire on the 35th lap on account of a power unit issue.</p>\n\n<p>He parked his car at a run-off area which prompted a Virtual Safety Car. Verstappen pitted and got new set of hard tyres.</p>\n\n<p>He was now 17 seconds behind the race leader with 20 laps to go. The Dutchman set about closing the gap and set a number of fastest laps, but he was not reducing the deficit by the amount needed to mount a challenge on Hamilton at the end of the race.</p>\n\n<p>It seemed as if Hamilton would cruise to an eighth title and even Red Bull's Team Principal, Christian Horner, deemed that only a miracle could hand the title over to them.</p>\n\n<p>Minutes after that wish, Williams\u2019 Latifi crashed at Turn Fourteen with only five laps to go, seconds after a tussle with the Haas of Mick Schumacher.</p>\n\n<p>Hamilton was 12 seconds ahead of Verstappen with three lapped cars lying between the two at the time of crash.</p>\n\n<p>With nothing to lose, Red Bull opted to pit Verstappen. It meant that there would be five lapped cars between him and Hamilton.</p>\n\n<p>There were only three laps to go and the question was whether all the lapped cars would be allowed to unlap themselves, as per the norm.</p>\n\n<p>This would take time and had the potential of making the race end under the Safety Car.</p>\n\n<p>Meanwhile, Perez was ordered to pit in order to retire the car, coming as a huge disappointment after his valiant effort to give his teammate a sling shot to victory by holding back Hamilton for as long as possible.</p>\n\n<p>On the penultimate lap, Horner asked Masi about the decision not to allow lapped cars to unlap themselves.</p>\n\n<p>Masi replied that he was assessing the situation. A short while later, the lapped cars between Hamilton and Verstappen were allowed to unlap themselves leaving others that were supposed to unlap themselves in limbo.</p>\n\n<p>On fresh softs, Verstappen was able to pass Hamilton who could do little to defend given his 42-lap old tyres.</p>\n\n<p>Verstappen took victory under questionable circumstances in the final lap to become the first ever Dutch Formula One world champion. Hamilton, on his part, congratulated the 24 year-old on his maiden title.</p>\n\n<p>The Dutchman set a record of 18 podium positions this season.

The study stemmed from a global survey of more than 21,000 participants in 21 countries that sought to find out about their attitudes towards privacy and digital stalking in intimate relationships.\n\nThe interviews were conducted online by Sapio Research in September 2021 using an email invitation and an online survey.\n\n\u201cWhile 70 per cent of the respondents do not believe it is acceptable to monitor their partner without consent, 30 per cent see no problem at all and find it acceptable under some circumstances. Of those who think certain reasons justify secret surveillance, almost two thirds (64 per cent) would do so if they believed their partner was being unfaithful; if it was related to their safety (63 per cent), or if they believed them to be involved in criminal activity (50 per cent),\u201d said the study.\n\nAbusive relationships\n\nThe highest agreement level on monitoring, noted the study, came from respondents in the Asia-Pacific region, who accounted for 24 per cent. Respondents in Europe and America accounted for 10 and eight per cent respectively.\n\nEven then, there are situations when people, most of them in abusive relationships, have been forced by their partners to install a monitoring app. The younger people aged 18-34, are much more likely to have received such a demand from their partner than elderly counterparts aged 35 and above.\n\nSeeking to also discover how stalkerware can be used to shed more light on domestic violence, researchers aimed to find out the degree of willingness by people to monitor their partners, and to uncover the types of data that is readily shared or kept secret. They also sought to uncover the number of stalkerware victims and devices commonly used by abusers to monitor victims.\n\nWhile addressing what kind of information people willingly share with their partners, they noted that privacy is a complex issue because people have unique boundaries regarding the information they are willing to disclose to their partner or allow them to have access to.\n\nThose in healthy relationships, for example, said they have either shared their phone password with their partners or know their partner\u2019s phone password. However, they understood that the password can be updated if the partner changed their mind, or the partner could withhold the device to prevent them from accessing information.\n\nStability and vulnerability\n\n\u201cStalkerware thrives specifically under circumstances where there is a disparity between the level of access to information that one partner wants, and what the other wishes to disclose,\u201d it noted. \u201cYounger people are vastly more vulnerable to its ill effects.\u201d\n\nThe researchers documented that the manner in which people who are suspected or confirmed being stalked react depends heavily on a victim\u2019s stability and vulnerability, availability of support networks and cultural attitudes towards abuse and behaviour within relationships.\n\nThey state: \u201cMore than half of the respondents would investigate if they found a monitoring app on their device and confront the person who installed it, while others would confront their partner if a monitoring app was installed on their phone without their consent. Those who wouldn\u2019t confront their partner if they found a monitoring app on their smartphone said it is because they think that discussing the situation wouldn\u2019t help and that they\u2019d have no way to prove their partner was responsible. Some would prefer another exit strategy.\u201d\n\nDr Berta Vall Castell\u00f3, research & development manager, European Network for the Work with Perpetrators of Domestic Violence (WWP EN), explained that the reasons are concerning and indicate an unhealthy relationship that borders on abuse.\n\n\u201cIf one partner feels unable to discuss something that crosses a personal boundary with their significant other, it is likely they are fearful of the consequences of doing so. Even if they feel discussing it would make no difference, their relationship is clearly not one where their autonomy and preferences are valued. Preferring a different exit strategy is a recommended reaction, and very sensible where someone fears for their safety,\u201d he said.\n\nHe added that there is a concern that standing up to a partner in this situation will only escalate the risk that a stalkerware victim faces.\n\n\u201cIt is dangerous to justify exerting any sort of control over a partner in the light of suspected infidelity. Preventive campaigns addressing the issues of coercive control, jealousy and infidelity would be a valuable tool against these attitudes,\u201d said Dr Castell\u00f3.\n\nData shows that phone apps were the most used technology used in stalking at 50 per cent, followed closely by tracking devices (29 per cent), laptop apps (27 per cent) and access to webcam (22 per cent). Smart home devices were rated at 18 per cent, health devices at 14 per cent, and others at seven per cent.\n\nMs Karen Bentley, CEO of Wesnet and a technology safety expert, said that when stalker ware is used as part of domestic abuse or intimate partner violence it can indicate that the abuser is very controlling.\n\nViolence\n\n\u201cIt could also be a sign that violence may get worse. I really urge anyone who is experiencing stalking \u2014 either in real life or through stalker ware \u2014 and who feels it would be unsafe or dangerous to confront their abuser, to reach out to a domestic abuse organisation to get advice and support,\u201d she advised.\n\nSo how can you know that your device is being monitored?\n\nResearchers say you should be on guard if your mobile data or battery runs out quicker than expected. This means there are apps in your device consuming your phone\u2019s resources. Device owners should also find out the apps that have access to their device locations by checking their phone\u2019s accessibility status.\n\nTo ensure you do not become a victim of stalkerware, Kaspersky recommends that users protect their phones and accounts with a strong password and never share it with partners, friends, or colleagues.\n\nDownload apps only from official sources such as Google Play or the App Store, install a reliable security solution immediately, and scan the device regularly. However, this should only be done after the potential risk to the victim has been assessed as the perpetrator may notice the use of a cyber-security solution, and even escalate their abusive behaviours in response.\n\nKaspersky also recommends that users be wary of deleting spyware in their phones, since it can erase evidence that might be needed later. Most importantly, users are asked to take protective measures first.\n\n\u201cIf you\u2019re being tracked by a potentially violent partner, before doing anything with the stalkerware app, contact a help centre for victims of domestic abuse. In some cases, it\u2019s easier to replace your smartphone altogether and then make sure that no one can install spying apps on the new device,\u201d advises the security company.

the Malian city of Timbuktu on Tuesday, in a symbolic departure more than eight years after Paris first intervened in the conflict-torn Sahel state.\n\nIt was there that then French president Francois Hollande formally declared the start of France's military intervention, in February 2013, designed to root out jihadist insurgents.\n\nA few days prior, French legionnaires and Malian troops had liberated Timbuktu, a northern desert city, after an eight-month Islamist occupation.\n\n\"Some people were overcome by emotion, women were crying, young people were shouting, I myself was overwhelmed,\" said Yehia Tandina, a Timbuktu television journalist, recalling the day.\n\nMohamed Ibrahim, the former president of the Timbuktu regional council, also described the day as \"joyful\" and \"beautiful\".\n\nJihadist activity\n\nBut now French troops are leaving their base in Timbuktu, raising questions about the future of jihadist activity as militants put down roots in the countryside.\n\nMathieu, a French sergeant, was part of the original contingent of French soldiers who arrived in Mali, and has returned to the Timbuktu base for the handover ceremony.\n\n\"We've come full circle,\" he said, smiling.\n\nSince 2013, Paris has deployed around 5,100 troops across the Sahel region \u2014 which includes Mali \u2014 helping to support local governments and their poorly equipped forces fight an ever-growing Islamist insurgency.\n\nHowever, French President Emmanuel Macron announced a major drawdown of French troops in June, after a military takeover in Mali in August 2020 that ousted the elected president Ibrahim Boubacar Keita.\n\nFrance's military deployment in the Sahel is due to fall to about 3,000 troops by next year.\n\nFrench forces have already left bases in the northern Malian towns of Kidal and Tessalit.\n\nNot the same\n\nThe French were greeted as liberators when they entered Timbuktu in 2013.\n\nFormer president Hollande also described the day French soldiers retook the city as \"the best day of his political life\".\n\nSergeant Mathieu said the atmosphere was no longer as jovial, although that locals are not hostile.\n\nA lack of enthusiasm may be linked to continuing conflict across the vast nation of 19 million people.\n\nJihadists\u2019 attacks have grown more frequent since 2013, and the conflict has spilled over into neighbouring Burkina Faso and Niger.\n\nWhether France's mission can be described as a military success is a sensitive question.\n\nFor Master Corporal Julien, who was also in Timbuktu in 2013: \"We have to hope that things will get better for civilians\".\n\nOutside the city, locals appear to have come to terms with the jihadists, said security officials and Western diplomats.\n\nAn acceptance of their legitimacy, at least among locals, may have also decreased violence.\n\nFewer attacks\n\n\"Where there is coexistence, there will certainly be fewer negative acts,\" said Tandina, the journalist, noting improved security in the Timbuktu region.\n\nAccording to the UN, militant attacks on civilians in Timbuktu and the surrounding area are at their lowest since 2015.\n\nStill, Westerners cannot travel outside the city without an armed escort.\n\nThe central government, which is supported by the UN inside the city, is largely invisible in the countryside.\n\nMost jihadists in the region are affiliated to al-Qaeda. In their propaganda, they boast that they control the territory and have won the hearts of locals.\n\nA Timbuktu resident, who declined to be named, told AFP many people prefer to use the Islamic court system rather than the official one.\n\nOne Islamic judge, Houka Houka Ag Alhousseini, remains active in the area despite figuring on a United Nations sanctions list for having worked in a similar capacity during the jihadist occupation of Timbuktu.\n\n'We live with it'\n\nNear Timbuktu airport, equipment from the French base ranging from satellite dishes to crates of medicine is piled up and ready to ship to the country's main Sahel military base at Gao in northern Mali.\n\nTents, among other small items, were due to be left behind.\n\nThe remaining French soldiers were milling about the camp with not much to do: the Wi-Fi has been disconnected, putting them on the same footing as Timbuktu residents.\n\nJihadists recently attacked telecommunications infrastructure, causing persistent network problems.\n\n\"Of course there are problems\" said Ali Ibrahim, a 26-year-old law student, citing a lack of work, among other issues impacting residents' lives.", "articleBodyHtml":

prior, French legionnaires and Malian troops had liberated Timbuktu, a northern desert city, after an eight-month Islamist occupation.</p>\n\n<p>\"Some people were overcome by emotion, women were crying, young people were shouting, I myself was overwhelmed,\" said Yehia Tandina, a Timbuktu television journalist, recalling the day.</p>\n\n<p>Mohamed Ibrahim, the former president of the Timbuktu regional council, also described the day as \"joyful\" and \"beautiful\".</p>\n\n<h2>Jihadist activity</h2>\n\n<p>But now French troops are leaving their base in Timbuktu, raising questions about the future of jihadist activity as militants put down roots in the countryside.</p>\n\n<p>Mathieu, a French sergeant, was part of the original contingent of French soldiers who arrived in Mali, and has returned to the Timbuktu base for the handover ceremony.</p>\n\n<p>\"We've come full circle,\" he said, smiling.</p>\n\n<p>Since 2013, Paris has deployed around 5,100 troops across the Sahel region \u2014 which includes Mali \u2014 helping to support local governments and their poorly equipped forces fight an ever-growing Islamist insurgency.</p>\n\n<p>However, French President Emmanuel Macron announced a major drawdown of French troops in June, after a military takeover in Mali in August 2020 that ousted the elected president Ibrahim Boubacar Keita.</p>\n\n<p>France's military deployment in the Sahel is due to fall to about 3,000 troops by next year.</p>\n\n<p>French forces have already left bases in the northern Malian towns of Kidal and Tessalit.</p>\n\n<h2>Not the same</h2>\n\n<p>The French were greeted as liberators when they entered Timbuktu in 2013.</p>\n\n<p>Former president Hollande also described the day French soldiers retook the city as \"the best day of his political life\".</p>\n\n<p>Sergeant Mathieu said the atmosphere was no longer as jovial, although that locals are not hostile.</p>\n\n<p>A lack of enthusiasm may be linked to continuing conflict across the vast nation of 19 million people.</p>\n\n<p>Jihadists\u2019 attacks have grown more frequent since 2013, and the conflict has spilled over into neighbouring Burkina Faso and Niger.</p>\n\n<p>Whether France's mission can be described as a military success is a sensitive question.</p>\n\n<p>For Master Corporal Julien, who was also in Timbuktu in 2013: \"We have to hope that things will get better for civilians\".</p>\n\n<p>Outside the city, locals appear to have come to terms with the jihadists, said security officials and Western diplomats.</p>\n\n<p>An acceptance of their legitimacy, at least among locals, may have also decreased violence.</p>\n\n<h2>Fewer attacks</h2>\n\n<p>\"Where there is coexistence, there will certainly be fewer negative acts,\" said Tandina, the journalist, noting improved security in the Timbuktu region.</p>\n\n<p>According to the UN, militant attacks on civilians in Timbuktu and the surrounding area are at their lowest since 2015.</p>\n\n<p>Still, Westerners cannot travel outside the city without an armed escort.</p>\n\n<p>The central government, which is supported by the UN inside the city, is largely invisible in the countryside.</p>\n\n<p>Most jihadists in the region are affiliated to al-Qaeda. In their propaganda, they boast that they control the territory and have won the hearts of locals.</p>\n\n<p>A Timbuktu resident, who declined to be named, told AFP many people prefer to use the Islamic court system rather than the official one.</p>\n\n<p>One Islamic judge, Houka Houka Ag Alhousseini, remains active in the area despite figuring on a United Nations sanctions list for having worked in a similar capacity during the jihadist occupation of Timbuktu.</p>\n\n<h2>'We live with it'</h2>\n\n<p>Near Timbuktu airport, equipment from the French base ranging from satellite dishes to crates of medicine is piled up and ready to ship to the country's main Sahel military base at Gao in northern Mali.</p>\n\n<p>Tents, among other small items, were due to be left behind.</p>\n\n<p>The remaining French soldiers were milling about the camp with not much to do: the Wi-Fi has been disconnected, putting them on the same footing as Timbuktu residents.</p>\n\n<p>Jihadists recently attacked telecommunications infrastructure, causing persistent network problems.</p>\n\n<p>\"Of course there are problems\" said Ali Ibrahim, a 26-year-old law student, citing a lack of work, among other issues impacting residents' lives.</p>\n\n</article>", "canonicalUrl": "https://www.breakingkenyanews.com/2021/12/french-soldiers-lower-flag-after-years.html"},{"url": "https://www.breakingkenyanews.com/search/label/WORLD", "probability": 0.6653507, "headline": "87 bomb detonators found at Colombo bus station", "datePublished": "2019-04-22T00:00:00", "datePublishedRaw": "Breaking Kenya news April 22, 2019 0", "inLanguage": "en", "description": "Breaking Kenya News", "articleBody": "By DAILY MONITOR More by this Author Wegnew Dessie is a middle-aged man of Ethiopian origin, who lives in South Africa.

Yes, it could be seasonal flu. Just remember that Sars-Cov-2 enters your system in exactly the same way as that bug,\u201d Prof Lukoye Atwoli, dean of the Medical College at Aga Khan University, said in a tweet. \u201cSo your risk of getting Covid-19 is high if you get the bug. If you protect yourself adequately from Covid-19 you\u2019ll probably be safe from the circulating respiratory bug as well.\u201d\n\nLast month, scientists predicted that Kenya would experience a fifth spike in Covid-19 infections towards the end of November and beginning December.\n\nUnlike the third and fourth waves, they said a spike was more likely than a wave. On Thursday, the director of the Africa Centres for Disease Control and Prevention (Africa CDC) warned countries across the continent to ready themselves for another spike.\n\n\u201cWe already have Omicron in seven countries. It is inevitable that we will experience another surge and that is why we are calling on people to get vaccinated,\u201d said Dr John Nkengasong at a weekly briefing.\n\nOmicron\n\nIn South Africa, where Omicron was first detected, data shows that some of the symptoms\u2014 blocked or runny nose\u2014 differ from those associated with other variants, while others like headache, sore throat and body aches, which are similar to flu symptoms, still indicate an infection.\n\nPreliminary studies, mostly in South Africa, show that Omicron does not cause severe illness, and deaths mainly occur among the unvaccinated.\n\nBut Omicron is highly transmissible, has a high positivity rate, and has high chances of reinfections and vaccine breakthrough infection. The latter occurs when a fully vaccinated person is infected with Covid-19.\n\nOn the severity of the disease, data from hospitals indicates that cases of infected people getting hospitalised or dying are low compared with the current community infection rate or previous waves. Most people infected in South Africa, for instance, have a milder disease that does not require oxygen therapy compared with the Delta variant.\n\nA study in South Africa, published online Tuesday, offered a glimpse at how vaccinated people might fare against Omicron.", "articleBodyHtml": "<article>\n\n<figure><a href=\"https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/a/AVvXsEje0xZ-WEugXTLhQ66LMC_RggaPVEFqn2Y57H2C3wE5Sj1IHYFS6o9Drlv5T5RPQnMfLguxsnCKyVUBBxTUNwzMO3VpFX-arQaAmlyC7xxsRFSvekT5ILfTCY44AjfqqxjzbT1QYbMQeULgdga_OKNn5BM0JcI17pMoQG1myyNcyif0FRkb5o9gvZr4ag=s720\"><img data-original-height=\"720\" data-original-width=\"720\" src=\"https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/a/AVvXsEje0xZ-WEugXTLhQ66LMC_RggaPVEFqn2Y57H2C3wE5Sj1IHYFS6o9Drlv5T5RPQnMfLguxsnCKyVUBBxTUNwzMO3VpFX-arQaAmlyC7xxsRFSvekT5ILfTCY44AjfqqxjzbT1QYbMQeULgdga_OKNn5BM0JcI17pMoQG1myyNcyif0FRkb5o9gvZr4ag=s320\"></a></figure>\n\n<p>The government says it will consider reintroducing a lockdown among other stringent measures if spiking coronavirus infections are not contained soon.</p>\n\n<p>After a two-month lull, Covid-19 cases have been on the rise in recent days, amid fears that Omicron variant, which is yet to be detected in Kenya, could be fuelling the fresh surge.</p>\n\n<p>As of yesterday, the national positivity rate stood at 6.6 per cent\u2014about six times what it was just a week ago (one per cent on December 4).</p>\n\n<p>Positivity rate is the percentage of people who test positive for the Sars-Cov-2 virus that causes the Covid-19 disease from an overall sample tested.</p>\n\n<p>The rate is a useful measure of how much the virus is spreading in a community and the World Health Organisation says anything above five percent is a concern.

On Thursday, the director of the Africa Centres for Disease Control and Prevention (Africa CDC) warned countries across the continent to ready themselves for another spike.</p>\n\n<p>\u201cWe already have Omicron in seven countries. It is inevitable that we will experience another surge and that is why we are calling on people to get vaccinated,\u201d said Dr John Nkengasong at a weekly briefing.</p>\n\n<h2>Omicron</h2>\n\n<p>In South Africa, where Omicron was first detected, data shows that some of the symptoms\u2014 blocked or runny nose\u2014 differ from those associated with other variants, while others like headache, sore throat and body aches, which are similar to flu symptoms, still indicate an infection.</p>\n\n<p>Preliminary studies, mostly in South Africa, show that Omicron does not cause severe illness, and deaths mainly occur among the unvaccinated.</p>\n\n<p>But Omicron is highly transmissible, has a high positivity rate, and has high chances of reinfections and vaccine breakthrough infection. The latter occurs when a fully vaccinated person is infected with Covid-19.</p>\n\n<p>On the severity of the disease, data from hospitals indicates that cases of infected people getting hospitalised or dying are low compared with the current community infection rate or previous waves. Most people infected in South Africa, for instance, have a milder disease that does not require oxygen therapy compared with the Delta variant.</p>\n\n<p>A study in South Africa, published online Tuesday, offered a glimpse at how vaccinated people might fare against Omicron.</p>\n\n</article>", "canonicalUrl": "https://www.breakingkenyanews.com/2021/12/rising-covid-infection-rates-could-lead.html"},{"url": "https://www.breakingkenyanews.com/search?updated-max=2021-12-14T10:21:00%2B03:00&max-results=7&start=6&by-date=false", "probability": 0.6376742, "headline": "The gold rush that drives miners into death traps", "datePublished": "2021-12-14T00:00:00", "datePublishedRaw": "December 14, 2021", "inLanguage": "en", "description": "Breaking Kenya News", "articleBody": "Red Bull's Max Verstappen clinched his first Formula One title on the last lap of the final race of what is arguably the most exciting...", "articleBodyHtml": "<article>\n\n<p>Red Bull's Max Verstappen clinched his first Formula One title on the last lap of the final race of what is arguably the most exciting...</p>\n\n</article>", "canonicalUrl": "https://www.breakingkenyanews.com/search?updated-max=2021-12-13T23:21:00-08:00&max-results=7&start=6&by-date=false"},{"url": "https://www.breakingkenyanews.com/2021/12/uhurus-big-dilemma-as-half-of-cabinet.html", "probability": 0.92933345, "headline": "Uhuru\u2019s big dilemma as half of Cabinet joins politics", "datePublished": "2021-12-14T00:00:00", "datePublishedRaw": "December 14, 2021", "dateModified": "2021-12-14T08:47:39+00:00", "dateModifiedRaw": "2021-12-14T08:47:39Z", "author": "Breaking Kenya news", "authorsList": ["Breaking Kenya news"], "inLanguage": "en", "breadcrumbs": [{"name": "Home", "link": "https://www.breakingkenyanews.com/"}, {"name": "NEWS", "link": "https://www.breakingkenyanews.com/search/label/NEWS"}, {"name": "Uhuru\u2019s big dilemma as half of Cabinet joins politics"}], "mainImage": "https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/a/AVvXsEgkD7tlOX7KeKpYzC39XLWlizkBm9b2Bwtj7BwKN4VABACZDtekTWe3wtbydK-eQ8yg21mCuLZGxq1bYzMPu_lisFQpyT93HRYjdTynCxUnnmxqtoCFrdp2ILdrfQX9i-R93eGHYXzZ9fEmpMD0ScPy8GzQBYprh-yQB8zrFC4AylwwuXECJnAzfWfGGg=s320", "images": ["https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/a/AVvXsEgkD7tlOX7KeKpYzC39XLWlizkBm9b2Bwtj7BwKN4VABACZDtekTWe3wtbydK-eQ8yg21mCuLZGxq1bYzMPu_lisFQpyT93HRYjdTynCxUnnmxqtoCFrdp2ILdrfQX9i-R93eGHYXzZ9fEmpMD0ScPy8GzQBYprh-yQB8zrFC4AylwwuXECJnAzfWfGGg=s320"], "description": " Breaking news, kenya news, county news, politics, business, sports, lifestyle and entertainment from Kenya and around the world", "articleBody": "President Kenyatta could be forced to reorganise his administration should half of his cabinet, who are intending to contest elective seats, resign in February.\n\nWith the General Election due in August, the President may either make new appointments or opt to have the remaining Cabinet Secretaries act in the vacant dockets as well.\n\nThis is the first time CSs are facing the prospect of departure with an outgoing Head of State, since, in 2017, President Kenyatta was seeking re-election.

She said managers told the police first, who allegedly then told her about the incident.\n\nShe also said that her daughter\u2019s body was taken to City Mortuary at 7am, and when she called at 11am to ask for details on how to pay her daughter\u2019s rent, she was not given the information she needed.\n\nMs Macharia had also cast doubt on the authenticity of a suicide note given to her, saying that if her daughter was indeed stressed, she would have talked to her therapist.\n\n\u201cWe as Qwetu management want to confirm that nobody entered her room from the time the nurse, receptionist and the security supervisor left,\u201d Mr Njenga said.\n\n\u201cThe supervisor informed the security manager, who in turn called the police. They arrived past noon, and they transferred the body to City Mortuary pending further investigations.\"\n\nHe said that the hostel's management called Ms Macharia on the same day Githae was found dead before they informed the police, but that Ms Macharia, upset, asked that the call be made later to allow her to come to terms with the news.\n\n\"We tried to call her again, but our calls went unanswered. The next thing we saw was a video of her speaking to the press,\u201d Mr Njenga said.\n\nHe explained that the suicide note, in three paragraphs, was handed over to Ms Macharia, and that it pointed to Githae\u2019s disagreements with her mother.\n\nNeema Githae, 21, was pursuing a Bachelor\u2019s degree in nursing at Kenyatta University and was in her second year.\n\nFollowing Ms Macharia\u2019s public demand for the management to provide at least two weeks of CCTV footage so that they could trace her movements, the family gathered at the hostel on Thursday, exactly one week after their loved one was found dead.\n\n'No foul play'\n\n\u201cWe viewed the CCTV footage at Qwetu in the company of Njenga, two of Githae\u2019s aunts and three other members of the family. We confirm that there was no foul play. Funeral arrangements are in place and we will lay Githae to rest on Tuesday,\u201d said James Ngeta, the family\u2019s representative.\n\nGithae joined KU on November 7, 2020, and she was last seen in class on September 27 this year, said Mogaka Saboke of Kenyatta University School of Nursing Science.\n\n\"Their classes resumed on September 20, and she was last seen on 27th, which was on Monday. Her classmates that I spoke to said she greeted everyone in class on that day, including those she wasn't fond of. When the class went on break, she sat alone near a flight of stairs, and refused to go back to class, saying her bottom hurt,\" Mr Saboke said.\n\nBefore Githae\u2019s death, the two had spoken by phone on two occasions. The first was on September 15, when Mr Saboke gave her a slot as one of two ushers who would help in the admission of new first-year students who joined the school on September 20. The second was in the evening, when Mr Saboke called to find out if everything had gone as planned.\n\nShe was due to sit for an exam on September 24, and she informed Mr Saboke that she was ready. The activities of admission day had not derailed her efforts to revise for the exam. It would be the last time he heard her voice.\n\nOn September 27, Githae called Mr Saboke on WhatsApp, but the call was not answered. At 7.35 pm, Mr Saboke texted her 'hey' with a smiley face emoji, and all he got was two grey ticks. The next thing he heard was that Githae had died.\n\n\u201cShe actually registered for that exam paper on September 21, and when I spoke to the school administrator, she said Githae seemed disturbed,\" Mr Saboke said.\n\nHe added that Githae had been a jovial woman.\n\nMr Saboke explained that Githae\u2019s best friend was still in shock and would need time to recover before she speaks.\n\nBrian Oyeezy, a senior nursing student at KU, met Githae during his clinical rotations at Embu Level Five Hospital. They both worked in the pediatric ward.\n\n\u201cI can tell you this for free, Neema made me doubt my passion for nursing. She was always happy, ready to work and curious to learn. She interacted with anyone regardless of their qualifications, and didn\u2019t fear confronting the consultants when she had a mind-boggling question,\u201d he said.\n\n\u201cEven though some people thought she was too talkative, we clicked, probably because I am also extroverted.\u201d\n\nHe had received the news of his friend\u2019s death on Friday morning via WhatsApp. A link had been sent to his phone, detailing that a schoolmate studying medicine had died.\n\n\u201cIt didn't hit me, since we are nursing students so I thought it was not one of the nursing students. Out of curiosity, I clicked the link and was shocked beyond words when I came across Neema's name,\u201d he says.\n\nWilliam Kunani, the deputy OCPD in Starehe Division, explained that on Thursday, September 30, police officers at the station received a call past noon from Qwetu Hostels asking them to go and investigate an incident.\n\n\u201cWhen the officers got there, they found the body of a young lady in the room and a suicide note. That is why we made the conclusion that it was suicide. We are, however, waiting for toxicology tests to confirm the actual cause of death,\" he explained.", "articleBodyHtml": "<article>\n\n<figure><a href=\"https://1.bp.blogspot.com/-splKuVB5-bQ/YWFpgHMLD9I/AAAAAAAAUDo/X0obkIYEcxIfQmm1YWN-T3vz_yMh3Td8gCLcBGAsYHQ/s960/neema-githae.jpg\"><img data-original-height=\"480\" data-original-width=\"960\" src=\"https://1.bp.blogspot.com/-splKuVB5-bQ/YWFpgHMLD9I/AAAAAAAAUDo/X0obkIYEcxIfQmm1YWN-T3vz_yMh3Td8gCLcBGAsYHQ/s320/neema-githae.jpg\"></a></figure>\n\n<p>A student whose death is the subject of a dispute between her mother and the managers of a residential building where she lived did not leave her room before her body was found.</p>\n\n<p>A press statement from Qwetu Hostels chief corporate affairs officer Peter Njenga says CCTV footage captured Neema Githae leaving her room on the morning of September 27 and returning in the afternoon.</p>\n\n<p>Later in the evening, the camera in the corridor next to her room captured lights coming from her bathroom window.

They arrived past noon, and they transferred the body to City Mortuary pending further investigations.\"</p>\n\n<p>He said that the hostel's management called Ms Macharia on the same day Githae was found dead before they informed the police, but that Ms Macharia, upset, asked that the call be made later to allow her to come to terms with the news.</p>\n\n<p>\"We tried to call her again, but our calls went unanswered. The next thing we saw was a video of her speaking to the press,\u201d Mr Njenga said.</p>\n\n<p>He explained that the suicide note, in three paragraphs, was handed over to Ms Macharia, and that it pointed to Githae\u2019s disagreements with her mother.</p>\n\n<p>Neema Githae, 21, was pursuing a Bachelor\u2019s degree in nursing at Kenyatta University and was in her second year.</p>\n\n<p>Following Ms Macharia\u2019s public demand for the management to provide at least two weeks of CCTV footage so that they could trace her movements, the family gathered at the hostel on Thursday, exactly one week after their loved one was found dead.</p>\n\n<h2>'No foul play'</h2>\n\n<p>\u201cWe viewed the CCTV footage at Qwetu in the company of Njenga, two of Githae\u2019s aunts and three other members of the family. We confirm that there was no foul play. Funeral arrangements are in place and we will lay Githae to rest on Tuesday,\u201d said James Ngeta, the family\u2019s representative.</p>\n\n<p>Githae joined KU on November 7, 2020, and she was last seen in class on September 27 this year, said Mogaka Saboke of Kenyatta University School of Nursing Science.</p>\n\n<p>\"Their classes resumed on September 20, and she was last seen on 27th, which was on Monday. Her classmates that I spoke to said she greeted everyone in class on that day, including those she wasn't fond of. When the class went on break, she sat alone near a flight of stairs, and refused to go back to class, saying her bottom hurt,\" Mr Saboke said.</p>\n\n<p>Before Githae\u2019s death, the two had spoken by phone on two occasions. The first was on September 15, when Mr Saboke gave her a slot as one of two ushers who would help in the admission of new first-year students who joined the school on September 20. The second was in the evening, when Mr Saboke called to find out if everything had gone as planned.</p>\n\n<p>She was due to sit for an exam on September 24, and she informed Mr Saboke that she was ready. The activities of admission day had not derailed her efforts to revise for the exam. It would be the last time he heard her voice.</p>\n\n<p>On September 27, Githae called Mr Saboke on WhatsApp, but the call was not answered. At 7.35 pm, Mr Saboke texted her 'hey' with a smiley face emoji, and all he got was two grey ticks. The next thing he heard was that Githae had died.</p>\n\n<p>\u201cShe actually registered for that exam paper on September 21, and when I spoke to the school administrator, she said Githae seemed disturbed,\" Mr Saboke said.</p>\n\n<p>He added that Githae had been a jovial woman.</p>\n\n<p>Mr Saboke explained that Githae\u2019s best friend was still in shock and would need time to recover before she speaks.</p>\n\n<p>Brian Oyeezy, a senior nursing student at KU, met Githae during his clinical rotations at Embu Level Five Hospital. They both worked in the pediatric ward.</p>\n\n<p>\u201cI can tell you this for free, Neema made me doubt my passion for nursing. She was always happy, ready to work and curious to learn. She interacted with anyone regardless of their qualifications, and didn\u2019t fear confronting the consultants when she had a mind-boggling question,\u201d he said.</p>\n\n<p>\u201cEven though some people thought she was too talkative, we clicked, probably because I am also extroverted.\u201d</p>\n\n<p>He had received the news of his friend\u2019s death on Friday morning via WhatsApp. A link had been sent to his phone, detailing that a schoolmate studying medicine had died.</p>\n\n<p>\u201cIt didn't hit me, since we are nursing students so I thought it was not one of the nursing students. Out of curiosity, I clicked the link and was shocked beyond words when I came across Neema's name,\u201d he says.</p>\n\n<p>William Kunani, the deputy OCPD in Starehe Division, explained that on Thursday, September 30, police officers at the station received a call past noon from Qwetu Hostels asking them to go and investigate an incident.</p>\n\n<p>\u201cWhen the officers got there, they found the body of a young lady in the room and a suicide note. That is why we made the conclusion that it was suicide. We are, however, waiting for toxicology tests to confirm the actual cause of death,\" he explained.</p>\n\n</article>", "canonicalUrl": "https://www.breakingkenyanews.com/2021/10/what-cctv-footage-reveals-about-death.html"},{"url": "https://www.breakingkenyanews.com/2019/04/double-tragedy-for-kones-family-in.html", "probability": 0.9597124, "headline": "Double tragedy for Kones family in Vicky\u2019s death", "datePublished": "2019-04-20T00:00:00", "datePublishedRaw": "April 20, 2019", "dateModified": "2019-04-20T15:13:26+00:00", "dateModifiedRaw": "2019-04-20T15:13:26Z", "author": "TOM OSANJO", "authorsList": ["TOM OSANJO"], "inLanguage": "en", "breadcrumbs": [{"name": "Home", "link": "https://www.breakingkenyanews.com/"}, {"name": "Counties", "link": "https://www.breakingkenyanews.com/search/label/Counties"}, {"name": "NEWS", "link": "https://www.breakingkenyanews.com/search/label/NEWS"}, {"name": "Double tragedy for Kones family in Vicky\u2019s death"}], "mainImage": "https://www.nation.co.ke/image/view/-/5080674/highRes/2319262/-/maxw/600/-/jv5rvv/-/Vicky.jpg", "description": " Breaking news, kenya news, county news, politics, business, sports, lifestyle and entertainment from Kenya and around the world", "articleBody": "Tragedy has once again visited the home of former Cabinet minister Kipkalya Kones following the death of his daughter Vicky Chebet Kones earlier this week.\n\n\u201cVicky had been unwell but her condition worsened on Tuesday night.

Speaking at Harvard University, Dr Karin Michels, an expert in epidemiology at the university, called coconut oil \u2018one of the worst foods you can eat\u2019. She even went so far to describe the oil as \u2018pure poison.\u2019 During her talk, titled \u2018Coconut Oil and other Nutritional Errors\u2019, Dr Michels explained that eating superfoods was unnecessary, because we already get enough nutrition from everyday foods. She said: \u201cWe are well and sufficiently supplied.\u201d This isn\u2019t the first time that experts have warned about the dangers of coconut oil. Victoria Taylor, a dietician at the British Heart Foundation, said: \u201cThere has been speculation that some of the saturated fat present in coconut oil may be better for us than other saturated fats, but so far there is not enough good-quality research to provide us with a definitive answer.\u201d Worryingly, coconut oil is about 86 per cent saturated fat. This is about one-third more than in butter. Ms Taylor added: \u201cWe know that diets high in saturated fat are associated with increased bad (LDL) cholesterol in the blood, and high cholesterol is a risk factor for coronary heart disease (CHD) and stroke.\u201d", "articleBodyHtml": "<article>\n\n<p>It is often portrayed as a healthy alternative to other oils, but it seems that\u00a0coconut oil\u00a0may not be as good for you thought.

She even went so far to describe the oil as \u2018pure poison.\u2019 During her talk, titled \u2018Coconut Oil and other Nutritional Errors\u2019, Dr Michels explained that eating\u00a0superfoods\u00a0was unnecessary, because we already get enough nutrition from everyday foods. She said: \u201cWe are well and sufficiently supplied.\u201d This isn\u2019t the first time that experts have warned about the dangers of coconut oil. Victoria Taylor, a dietician at the British Heart Foundation, said: \u201cThere has been speculation that some of the saturated fat present in coconut oil may be better for us than other saturated fats, but so far there is not enough good-quality research to provide us with a definitive answer.\u201d Worryingly, coconut oil is about 86 per cent saturated fat. This is about one-third\u00a0more\u00a0than in butter. Ms Taylor added: \u201cWe know that diets high in saturated fat are associated with increased bad (LDL) cholesterol in the blood, and high cholesterol is a risk factor for coronary heart disease (CHD) and stroke.\u201d<br>\n<img alt=\"Image result for coconut oil\"
