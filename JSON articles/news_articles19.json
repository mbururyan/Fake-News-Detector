They have a desire grow their money and then invest at home. Another reason is, one has trust that their money is safe in a home bank. There are other reasons beside those two.\n\nThings change or the drama starts when your bank insiders see that this guy has been gone for too long and his money is just \u201csleeping\u201d in the account without use. Then someone crafts a way of helping themselves with your money.\n\nI was a victim of this bank insider fraud. I was abroad for an extended period of time from 2007 to 2018.

The leaders will report to Ruto\u2019s campaign strategist in Nairobi Mr Eliud Owalo.\n\nThe leadership will comprise four representatives from eight regional chapters in North America, referred to as the National Governing Council (NGC). Each chapter will be led by a regional chair. The Diaspora Hustler Movement leadership will encompass the regions which cover, New England, New Jersey, New York, Dallas, Houston, Minneapolis, Boston, Seattle, Atlanta, and Ontario, Canada.\n\nWith the understanding of how high the political stakes are in the country, the Diaspora Hustler Movement will coordinate three major segments of the DP\u2019s Presidential campaign-resource mobilization, publicity, and campaign strategy. The team will also popularize the United Democratic alliance party (UDA) in the diaspora and within the country.\n\nUnder the \u201cbottom-up\u201d economic model championed by DP Ruto; the Kenyan diaspora believes that the economy can be tailored to spur the standard of life to the entire citizenry through the creation of jobs, skill training, rural development, affordable housing, and access to micro-credits services to boost small businesses.\n\nIf implemented, this model will tremendously lift citizens at the bottom ladder economically, hence, bail them out of poverty.\n\nThose who misconstrue Ruto\u2019s economic strategy needs to understand that the hustler movement is tailored towards addressing the plight of the downtrodden members of our society. That\u2019s why there is too much goodwill towards Ruto\u2019s presidential bid. As always, a true campaign starts with interaction, connectivity, bonding, and the creation of impact on the ground based on practical steps. This is exactly what the Ruto campaign is doing.\n\nThe chairman of the team, Dr. Daniel Sambu, who is also deputized by David Okoth said that the Kenyan diaspora will soon release a policy paper on diaspora engagements especially on representation, and remittances, to enhance the \u201cbottoms-up\u201d economic model, which is the clarion for Ruto\u2019s economic emancipation for Kenya. New England region will be represented by Paul Muite, Pacific region by Prestige Kiarie, Abraham Kirwa, South East, and Sebastian Gaitho, the\nMidwest.\n\nIn a statement released by the team\u2019s media liaison and publicity coordinator from New Jersey, Mr Lister Nyaringo, the leaders are elated to hit the ground running to ensure that the DP is elected the 5th President of Kenya.

The leaders will report to Ruto\u2019s campaign strategist in Nairobi Mr Eliud Owalo.</p>\n\n<p>The leadership will comprise four representatives from eight regional chapters in North America, referred to as the National Governing Council (NGC). Each chapter will be led by a regional chair. The Diaspora Hustler Movement leadership will encompass the regions which cover, New England, New Jersey, New York, Dallas, Houston, Minneapolis, Boston, Seattle, Atlanta, and Ontario, Canada.</p>\n\n<p>With the understanding of how high the political stakes are in the country, the Diaspora Hustler Movement will coordinate three major segments of the DP\u2019s Presidential campaign-resource mobilization, publicity, and campaign strategy. The team will also popularize the United Democratic alliance party (UDA) in the diaspora and within the country.</p>\n\n<p>Under the \u201cbottom-up\u201d economic model championed by DP Ruto; the Kenyan diaspora believes that the economy can be tailored to spur the standard of life to the entire citizenry through the creation of jobs, skill training, rural development, affordable housing, and access to micro-credits services to boost small businesses.</p>\n\n<p>If implemented, this model will tremendously lift citizens at the bottom ladder economically, hence, bail them out of poverty.</p>\n\n<p>Those who misconstrue Ruto\u2019s economic strategy needs to understand that the hustler movement is tailored towards addressing the plight of the downtrodden members of our society. That\u2019s why there is too much goodwill towards Ruto\u2019s presidential bid. As always, a true campaign starts with interaction, connectivity, bonding, and the creation of impact on the ground based on practical steps. This is exactly what the Ruto campaign is doing.</p>\n\n<p>The chairman of the team, Dr. Daniel Sambu, who is also deputized by David Okoth said that the Kenyan diaspora will soon release a policy paper on diaspora engagements especially on representation, and remittances, to enhance the \u201cbottoms-up\u201d economic model, which is the clarion for Ruto\u2019s economic emancipation for Kenya.

Martin Wambora of Embu County was impeached in 2014, but survived removal from office, unlike Gov. Ferdinand Waititu of Kiambu County and Gov. Mike Sonko Mbuvi of Nairobi County.\n\nWhat is it that Wambora did that Waititu and Sonko did not do?\n\nGov. Wambora appealed his impeachment at the Supreme Court of Kenya, and was granted a stay, and it defies logic why Gov. Waititu and Gov. Sonko were not allowed to pursue the same course of action as Gov. Wambora. There is no way that a system that operates on such blatant double standards can be given a \"clean bill of health.\"\n\nA system, any system, is either functional or dysfunctional, and devolution in Kenya so far is glaringly dysfunctional, \"a game of chance.\"\n\nIn addition to No. 1 above, there have been way too many impeachments of Governors in Kenya since 2013, a clear sign that devolution in Kenya is in shambles.\n\nImpeachments are nothing to be proud of.\n\nPresident Richard Nixon of America came close to be being impeached in 1974, but rather than face possible impeachment and a possible criminal trial over the Watergate Scandal after being impeached, President Nixon resigned, and upon resigning, was pardoned by his successor as US President i.e. Nixon's Vice President Gerald Ford.\n\nPresident Bill Clinton of America was impeached in 1998 but the US Senate, where President Clinton's Democratic Party was in the majority, overruled the impeachment vote by the US House of Representatives.\n\nOutgoing US President Donald Trump was impeached but the US Senate, where President Trump's Republican Party were in the majority, overruled the impeachment vote by the US House of Representatives.\n\nOver 46 years in America therefore, there have been two impeachments, and one near impeachment. In addition to No. 1 above, impeachments in Kenya over the last seven years are as follows:\n\n2. Gov. Nderitu Gachagua (RIP) of Nyeri County was impeached, but survived;\n\n3. Gov. (Prof.) Paul Chepkwony of Kericho County was impeached, but survived;\n\n4. Gov. Francis Mwangi wa Iria of Muranga County was impeached, but survived;\n\n5. Gov. Granton Samboja of Taita Taveta County was impeached, but survived;\n\n6. Gov. Ann Waiguru of Kirinyaga County was impeached, but survived;\n\n7. Gov. Ferdinand Waititu of Kiambu County, as mentioned above, was impeached, and his impeachment upheld. Gov. Waititu's successor, Gov. James Nyoro, was recently \"threatened\" about also being impeached, by Members of the County Assembly (MCAs) of Kiambu County. Gov. James Nyoro of Kiambu County therefore and so far, is like President Richard Nixon of America. President Richard Nixon (RIP) also has other buddies in Kenya, aside from Gov. James Nyoro, when it comes to near impeachment e.g. Gov. Okoth Obado and Gov. Evans Kidero.\n\n8. Gov. Mike Sonko Mbuvi, as also mentioned above, was impeached this past week, and his impeachment upheld;\n\nRelated to numbers one to eight above:\n\n9. Gov. Moses Lenonkulal of Samburu County was interdicted at the same time as Governors Ferdinand Waititu and Mike Sonko Mbuvi, but Gov. Lenonkulal has resumed duties as Governor of Samburu County. It appears Gov. Lenonkulal has been spared unlike Governors Waititu and Sonko;\n\n10. The Kenya Revenue Authority (KRA) has taken over key functions of revenue collection from the Kiambu County Government, a sign that the Kiambu County Government is in trouble.\n\nIn the 1970s, the 1980s and the 1990s, Kiambu County Council (today the Kiambu County Government), was the No. 1 County Council in Kenya, followed closely at No. 2 by Narok County Council (today the Narok County Government), so if the Kiambu County Government is in trouble, just what is the state of the other 46 Counties in Kenya?\n\n11. The Central Kenya Government has taken over four key functions of governance from the Nairobi County Government, including revenue collection.\n\nIn addition, current Kenyan President Uhuru Kenyatta, has established a \"Parallel Government\" in Nairobi County by establishing the Nairobi Metropolitan Service (NMS), headed by Maj. Gen. Mohammed Badi. There are now two centres of power in the County of Nairobi. What sense does this make?\n\nIn 1983, then Kenyan President Daniel T. arap Moi dissolved the overwhelmed Nairobi City Council and replaced it with the Nairobi City Commission. The Nairobi City Commission operated from 1983 to 1993, when the Nairobi City Council made a formal comeback.\n\nWhy therefore didn't President Uhuru Kenyatta similarly dissolve the Nairobi County Government and replace it with the Nairobi Metropolitan Service (NMS), in an action similar to that taken above by President Daniel T. arap Moi back in 1983?\n\nPresident Uhuru Kenyatta could not have taken a decision similar to that of President Daniel T. arap Moi because it would have spelt the end of Kenya's short lived and disastrous experiment with devolution i.e. President Uhuru Kenyatta would have been left with no other choice but to similarly dissolve the 46 other County Governments in Kenya, a very practical decision yes, but suicidal politically.\n\nThe City of Nairobi is \"a country within a country,\" just like the City of London, is \"a country within a country,\" so if the City of Nairobi/County of Nairobi is in trouble, what about Kenya's other 46 Counties?\n\n12. Polycarp Igathe abruptly resigned as the Deputy Governor of Nairobi County in 2017. The County of Nairobi has been without a Deputy Governor for three years now.\n\nHow did this happen, and how did this escape the \"oversight\" of the Kenya Senate? The Kenya Senate was quick to impeach Gov. Mike Mbuvi Sonko, but not to note the absence of a Deputy Governor in Nairobi County over a period of three years.\n\nThere was a smooth transfer of power from Governor to Deputy Governor in Nyeri County following the demise of Gov. Nderitu Gachagua (RIP). There was a smooth transfer of power from Governor to Deputy Governor in Bomet County following the demise of Gov. Joyce Laboso (RIP), there is an ongoing smooth transfer of power in Nyamira County following the demise of Gov. John Nyagarama (RIP), and there was a smooth transfer of power from Governor to Deputy Governor in Kiambu County following the impeachment of Gov. Ferdinand Waititu.\n\nGov. Mike Sonko Mbuvi of Nairobi County has just been impeached, Nairobi County, as mentioned, has not had a Deputy Governor since 2017, the Speaker of the Nairobi County Assembly has just \"seized power\" as Acting Governor of Nairobi County in little more than a \"Palace Coup,\" and the County of Nairobi is due to hold a high profile, expensive, wasteful and totally unnecessary by-election in February 2021 to elect a new Governor and Deputy Governor of Nairobi County. Happy New Year 2021.\n\nAdditionally, between 2013 and 2017, there were citizen petitions to dissolve the County Governments of Isiolo, Kiambu, Makueni and Kisumu.\n\nThose of Isiolo, Kiambu and Kisumu lost steam and fizzled out midway. The Makueni County citizens petition was however upheld and endorsed by a vote by the Makueni County Assembly, following the collection of requisite signatures from all across Makueni County. President Uhuru Kenyatta thereafter appointed a Commission headed by lawyer Mohammed Nyaoga, to visit Makueni County and establish whether it was indeed the wish of the people of Makueni County that the Makueni County Government be dissolved. The people of Makueni confirmed this to the Mohammed Nyaoga led Commission.\n\nPresident Uhuru Kenyatta nevertheless overruled Mohammed Nyaoga and his Commission, and the Makueni County Government survived being dissolved. President Uhuru Kenyatta was no doubt concerned that if he upheld the dissolution of the Makueni County Government, numerous other Counties in Kenya, possibly all the remaining 46 Counties in Kenya, would similarly express the wish that their County Governments be dissolved.\n\nIt is no secret that devolution in Kenya has been buying time right from inception in 2013, and should not have been allowed to take root in the first place.\n\nDuring the Daniel T. arap Moi presidency in Kenya of 1978 to 2002, was unveiled what was referred to as Sessional Paper No. 1 of 1986 i.e. \"District Focus for Rural Development.\" Sessional Paper No. 1 of 1986 i.e. \"District Focus for Rural Development\" was actually devolution by another name, and made strides, even though funding for Sessional Paper No. 1 of 1986 i.e. \"District Focus for Rural Development,\" was stopped in 1990.\n\nA good number of facilities currently in use in Kenya's current 47 Counties were actually constructed courtesy of the epic Sessional Paper No. 1 of 1986 i.e. \"District Focus for Rural Development.\"\n\nSessional Paper No. 1 of 1986 i.e. \"District Focus for Rural Development,\" came into effect as a result of an Act of Parliament, and not by way of a referendum, a New Constitution, or Building Buildings Initiative (BBI), Sessional Paper No. 1 of 1986 i.e. \"District Focus for Rural Development\" is still supporting many corners of Kenya after 34 years, meaning that change can come to Kenya without the drama, expense and razzmatazz of either a referendum, devolution, a New Constitution or Building Buildings Initiative (BBI).", "articleBodyHtml": "<article>\n\n<p>Devolution in Kenya appears to be a disaster frying in it's fat, after only seven short years, otherwise, for example, the high profile Building Bridges Initiative (BBI) would not currently be ongoing and in full swing.

Moses Lenonkulal of Samburu County was interdicted at the same time as Governors Ferdinand Waititu and Mike Sonko Mbuvi, but Gov. Lenonkulal has resumed duties as Governor of Samburu County. It appears Gov. Lenonkulal has been spared unlike Governors Waititu and Sonko;</p>\n\n<p>10. The Kenya Revenue Authority (KRA) has taken over key functions of revenue collection from the Kiambu County Government, a sign that the Kiambu County Government is in trouble.</p>\n\n<p>In the 1970s, the 1980s and the 1990s, Kiambu County Council (today the Kiambu County Government), was the No. 1 County Council in Kenya, followed closely at No. 2 by Narok County Council (today the Narok County Government), so if the Kiambu County Government is in trouble, just what is the state of the other 46 Counties in Kenya?</p>\n\n<p>11. The Central Kenya Government has taken over four key functions of governance from the Nairobi County Government, including revenue collection.</p>\n\n<p>In addition, current Kenyan President Uhuru Kenyatta, has established a \"Parallel Government\" in Nairobi County by establishing the Nairobi Metropolitan Service (NMS), headed by Maj. Gen. Mohammed Badi. There are now two centres of power in the County of Nairobi. What sense does this make?</p>\n\n<p>In 1983, then Kenyan President Daniel T. arap Moi dissolved the overwhelmed Nairobi City Council and replaced it with the Nairobi City Commission. The Nairobi City Commission operated from 1983 to 1993, when the Nairobi City Council made a formal comeback.</p>\n\n<p>Why therefore didn't President Uhuru Kenyatta similarly dissolve the Nairobi County Government and replace it with the Nairobi Metropolitan Service (NMS), in an action similar to that taken above by President Daniel T. arap Moi back in 1983?</p>\n\n<p>President Uhuru Kenyatta could not have taken a decision similar to that of President Daniel T. arap Moi because it would have spelt the end of Kenya's short lived and disastrous experiment with devolution i.e. President Uhuru Kenyatta would have been left with no other choice but to similarly dissolve the 46 other County Governments in Kenya, a very practical decision yes, but suicidal politically.</p>\n\n<p>The City of Nairobi is \"a country within a country,\" just like the City of London, is \"a country within a country,\" so if the City of Nairobi/County of Nairobi is in trouble, what about Kenya's other 46 Counties?</p>\n\n<p>12. Polycarp Igathe abruptly resigned as the Deputy Governor of Nairobi County in 2017. The County of Nairobi has been without a Deputy Governor for three years now.</p>\n\n<p>How did this happen, and how did this escape the \"oversight\" of the Kenya Senate? The Kenya Senate was quick to impeach Gov. Mike Mbuvi Sonko, but not to note the absence of a Deputy Governor in Nairobi County over a period of three years.</p>\n\n<p>There was a smooth transfer of power from Governor to Deputy Governor in Nyeri County following the demise of Gov. Nderitu Gachagua (RIP).\u00a0 There was a smooth transfer of power from Governor to Deputy Governor in Bomet County following the demise of Gov. Joyce Laboso (RIP), there is an ongoing smooth transfer of power in Nyamira County following the demise of Gov. John Nyagarama (RIP), and there was a smooth transfer of power from Governor to Deputy Governor in Kiambu County following the impeachment of Gov. Ferdinand Waititu.</p>\n\n<p>Gov. Mike Sonko Mbuvi of Nairobi County has just been impeached, Nairobi County, as mentioned, has not had a Deputy Governor since 2017, the Speaker of the Nairobi County Assembly has just \"seized power\" as Acting Governor of Nairobi County in little more than a \"Palace Coup,\" and the County of Nairobi is due to hold a high profile, expensive, wasteful and totally unnecessary by-election in February 2021 to elect a new Governor and Deputy Governor of Nairobi County. Happy New Year 2021.</p>\n\n<p>Additionally, between 2013 and 2017, there were citizen petitions to dissolve the County Governments of Isiolo, Kiambu, Makueni and Kisumu.</p>\n\n<p>Those of Isiolo, Kiambu and Kisumu lost steam and fizzled out midway. The Makueni County citizens petition was however upheld and endorsed by a vote by the Makueni County Assembly, following the collection of requisite signatures from all across Makueni County. President Uhuru Kenyatta thereafter appointed a Commission headed by lawyer Mohammed Nyaoga, to visit Makueni County and establish whether it was indeed the wish of the people of Makueni County that the Makueni County Government be dissolved. The people of Makueni confirmed this to the Mohammed Nyaoga led Commission.</p>\n\n<p>President Uhuru Kenyatta nevertheless overruled Mohammed Nyaoga and his Commission, and the Makueni County Government survived being dissolved. President Uhuru Kenyatta was no doubt concerned that if he upheld the dissolution of the Makueni County Government, numerous other Counties in Kenya, possibly all the remaining 46 Counties in Kenya, would similarly express the wish that their County Governments be dissolved.</p>\n\n<p>It is no secret that devolution in Kenya has been buying time right from inception in 2013, and should not have been allowed to take root in the first place.</p>\n\n<p>During the Daniel T. arap Moi presidency in Kenya of 1978 to 2002, was unveiled what was referred to as Sessional Paper No. 1 of 1986 i.e. \"District Focus for Rural Development.\" Sessional Paper No. 1 of 1986 i.e. \"District Focus for Rural Development\" was actually devolution by another name, and made strides, even though funding for Sessional Paper No. 1 of 1986 i.e. \"District Focus for Rural Development,\" was stopped in 1990.</p>\n\n<p>A good number of facilities currently in use in Kenya's current 47 Counties were actually constructed courtesy of the epic Sessional Paper No. 1 of 1986 i.e. \"District Focus for Rural Development.\"</p>\n\n<p>Sessional Paper No. 1 of 1986 i.e. \"District Focus for Rural Development,\" came into effect as a result of an Act of Parliament, and not by way of a referendum, a New Constitution, or Building Buildings Initiative (BBI), Sessional Paper No. 1 of 1986 i.e. \"District Focus for Rural Development\" is still supporting many corners of Kenya after 34 years, meaning that change can come to Kenya without the drama, expense and razzmatazz of either a referendum, devolution, a New Constitution or Building Buildings Initiative (BBI).</p>\n\n</article>", "canonicalUrl": "https://www.mwakilishi.com/blog/2020-12-27/is-devolution-in-kenya-working-or-not"},{"url": "https://www.mwakilishi.com/blog/2020-04-10/wakenya-wenzangu-let-us-take-the-coronavirus-pandemic-seriously", "probability": 0.8859065, "headline": "Wakenya Wenzangu.

Some researched and others, like mine, are just personal opinions. The good things about opinions is that everyone has one and they are entitled to them, but how much the opinion stinks depends on the nose bearer.\n\nA good friend of mine called me today as he was preparing for an interview. One of his primary concerns was, \u201cwhat are they going to think about me wanting to leave my job after only 2.5 years?!\u201d That got me thinking about what my resume looks like \u2013 when did I stop caring what it looks like?\n\nWelcome to America!\n\nI am about to hit my 15-year mark since I came to this beautiful country. I remember that day like it was yesterday. I found myself in Buffalo, NY, in the winter. I was cold, I had no friends, very little money, but what I did have was a thirst for what the future promised. I wanted to be a lawyer; it\u2019s all I ever wanted. Well, if I\u2019m telling the truth, that was what I wanted before I realized that being the president of Kenya was not really something I had the desire for. But, even with this thirst in a beautiful country, living in Buffalo was hard. (Another story of its own!) So hard that every time I think things are rough, I just think of those poor people in Buffalo.\n\nThere is one good thing that came out of my time spent in Buffalo \u2013 I realized I did not want to be a lawyer. I know, I just told you this is all I ever wanted, but late at night when I was in deep thought trying to figure out what to eat the next day, I\u2019d watch the never-ending Keller and Keller infomercials. (To this day, I still wonder if I have mesothelioma.) So, thanks to their infomercials I also realized I didn\u2019t have the desire to be a lawyer. So, I found myself with a dead president and a dead lawyer dream and this only meant one thing \u2013 I now had to figure out what I wanted to do with my life.\n\nNo Dream & Confusing Towns\n\nSo, off to Ocean City I went!\n\nBy the way, why do we use the same name for different towns in different states? This is very confusing even now let alone when I was only 6 months in this country. Next time you see me, ask me how I found myself in Maryland after an 18-hour bus ride, only to find out I was supposed to be in NJ! Again, another story for another day!\n\nI found myself a nice job and a nice boss. I originally had only intended to be in Ocean City for 3 months and 1 \u00bd years later I was still there. That is until one day my boss \u2013 the boss that taught me American football \u2013 fired me. His reason, \u201cyou need to do something better with your life.\u201d So yet again, I found myself not knowing what to do with my life.\n\nFinding Opportunity\n\nI came to America with a thirst for the promises of my future, and somehow, I found myself in Columbus, OH learning how to drive a truck. I drove over the road for a few years, and while I am not a believer of coincidences, this is when I learned about supply chain. Truck driving to date remains to be the most difficult job I have ever done. Through that process, I knew what I wanted to do when I went back to school. Then, my first job out of school further opened my eyes to supply chain management. I wanted to know it all! This also meant doing it all. So, after coming to this beautiful country with big dreams that were crossed off of the list, one by one, I finally figured out what I wanted to be when I grew up.\n\nLifelong Learning\n\nIn the process, I have worked any job you can think of in a manufacturing and distribution setting. Every job came with its own challenges and every single one of them better prepared me for the next one. Outside of wanting to know everything, there have been other key factors that have contributed to my job changes:\n\n1. BOSS\n\nI like to choose who I work for. A good relationship with my boss is paramount to me. If I am going to work for someone for 8 hours a day, we better get along and get along does not mean being friends. As an ENFJ that values autonomy, the worst kind of a boss I can ever have is a micromanager. The good thing is that these types of bosses are easy to point out, and hence easy to leave, or to say thanks but no thanks\n\n2. MONEY\n\nMy first job out of college was what you would expect as a new graduate. Three years into it and after a promotion, I found myself doing the math of how many diapers my son was going through a day. I realized if I was going to be the provider, I needed to make more money! So, I did what every good negotiator does, I had my data ready to present to my boss and show him why I needed a little more money. The data told me more than I had thought. I realized that I can slave away, get an annual raise, and if I am lucky get a promotion here and there, but it was going to take more than 15 years to get to \u201cgood money land\u201d. So, while my boss did everything he could and got me more than thought possible, I had already done my market research and I opted to take my chances with the market. Best decision I could have made.\n\n3. BOREDOM\n\nI am a problem solver naturally. That means a stable, 100-year-old process that is a cash cow with little to no possibility of improving efficiency is not where I want to be. I like to go to unchartered territories. Especially if other people are running away. Some of these problems can take 6 months to solve or maybe, one to two years. Regardless of the time, I better have something lined up or else I am bored, and when I am bored my mind wonders: \u201cwhat would it be like to live in Hazardville, CT. The next thing you know, I am in Hazardville.\n\n4. CHANCE\n\nSometimes you get an unexpected call. On the other end is a good recruiter/hiring manager. So good in fact they manage to convince you that Hazardville, CT is not where you want to be but rather you need to be in Accident, MD. You visit Accident and realize it is slightly better than Buffalo and anything better than Buffalo can work and you find yourself there.\n\nI really enjoy supply chain. More so now that I feel like I have a slight idea of what I am doing. I am never the subject matter expert in most things supply chain but from Materials, Planning, Purchasing, Sourcing, Transportation to Finance and IT \u2013 I can walk into any of those rooms and bring something to the table. That is one of the biggest advantages to what other people may perceive as a weakness on the resume. As a manager, I take it upon myself to keep my people inspired. Retention however goes beyond being inspired and it is not a one size fits all.\n\nWhat we bring to the table as millennials is experience outside of your companies four walls. What makes me successful today is because most of the problems I face on a day today basis, I have seen them somewhere else.\n\nMy advice to my friend earlier was for him to go in with her head held high and be proud of the achievements she has had in those two years.", "articleBodyHtml": "<article>\n\n<p>There is a lot of literature out there regarding millennials, some scientific and others not.

One of his primary concerns was, \u201cwhat are they going to think about me wanting to leave my job after only 2.5 years?!\u201d That got me thinking about what my resume looks like \u2013 when did I stop caring what it looks like?</p>\n\n<p><strong>Welcome to America! </strong></p>\n\n<p>I am about to hit my 15-year mark since I came to this beautiful country. I remember that day like it was yesterday.\u00a0I found myself in Buffalo, NY, in the winter. I was cold, I had no friends, very little money, but what I did have was a thirst for what the future promised. I wanted to be a lawyer; it\u2019s all I ever wanted. Well, if I\u2019m telling the truth, that was what I wanted before I realized that being the president of Kenya was not really something I had the desire for. But, even with this thirst in a beautiful country, living in Buffalo was hard. (<em>Another story of its own!)</em> So hard that every time I think things are rough, I just think of those poor people in Buffalo.</p>\n\n<p>There is one good thing that came out of my time spent in Buffalo \u2013 I realized I did not want to be a lawyer. I know, I just told you this is all I ever wanted, but late at night when I was in deep thought trying to figure out what to eat the next day, I\u2019d watch the never-ending Keller and Keller infomercials. (<em>To this day, I still wonder if I have mesothelioma</em>.) So, thanks to their infomercials I also realized I didn\u2019t have the desire to be a lawyer. So, I found myself with a dead president and a dead lawyer dream and this only meant one thing \u2013 I now had to figure out what I wanted to do with my life.</p>\n\n<p><strong>No Dream &amp; Confusing Towns</strong></p>\n\n<p>So, off to Ocean City I went!</p>\n\n<p><em>By the way, why do we use the same name for different towns in different states?\u00a0This is very confusing even now let alone when I was only 6 months in this country. Next time you see me, ask me how I found myself in Maryland after an 18-hour bus ride, only to find out I was supposed to be in NJ! Again, another story for another day!</em></p>\n\n<p>I found myself a nice job and a nice boss. I originally had only intended to be in Ocean City for 3 months and 1 \u00bd years later I was still there. That is until one day my boss \u2013 the boss that taught me American football \u2013 fired me. His reason, \u201cyou need to do something better with your life.\u201d So yet again, I found myself not knowing what to do with my life.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Finding Opportunity </strong></p>\n\n<p>I came to America with a thirst for the promises of my future, and somehow, I found myself in Columbus, OH learning how to drive a truck. I drove over the road for a few years, and while I am not a believer of coincidences, this is when I learned about supply chain. Truck driving to date remains to be the most difficult job I have ever done. Through that process, I knew what I wanted to do when I went back to school. Then, my first job out of school further opened my eyes to supply chain management. I wanted to know it all! This also meant doing it all. So, after coming to this beautiful country with big dreams that were crossed off of the list, one by one, I finally figured out what I wanted to be when I grew up.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Lifelong Learning</strong></p>\n\n<p>In the process, I have worked any job you can think of in a manufacturing and distribution setting. Every job came with its own challenges and every single one of them better prepared me for the next one.\u00a0Outside of wanting to know everything, there have been other key factors that have contributed to my job changes:</p>\n\n<p><strong>1. BOSS</strong></p>\n\n<p>I like to choose who I work for. A good relationship with my boss is paramount to me. If I am going to work for someone for 8 hours a day, we better get along and get along does not mean being friends.\u00a0As an ENFJ that values autonomy, the worst kind of a boss I can ever have is a micromanager. The good thing is that these types of bosses are easy to point out, and hence easy to leave, or to say thanks but no thanks</p>\n\n<p><strong>2. MONEY</strong></p>\n\n<p>My first job out of college was what you would expect as a new graduate. Three years into it and after a promotion, I found myself doing the math of how many diapers my son was going through a day. I realized if I was going to be the provider, I needed to make more money! So, I did what every good negotiator does, I had my data ready to present to my boss and show him why I needed a little more money. <em>The data told me more than I had thought. </em>I realized that I can slave away, get an annual raise, and if I am lucky get a promotion here and there, but it was going to take more than 15 years to get to \u201cgood money land\u201d.\u00a0So, while my boss did everything he could and got me more than thought possible, I had already done my market research and I opted to take my chances with the market. Best decision I could have made.</p>\n\n<p><strong>3. BOREDOM</strong></p>\n\n<p>I am a problem solver naturally. That means a stable, 100-year-old process that is a cash cow with little to no possibility of improving efficiency is not where I want to be. I like to go to unchartered territories. Especially if other people are running away.\u00a0Some of these problems can take 6 months to solve or maybe, one to two years. Regardless of the time, I better have something lined up or else I am bored, and when I am bored my mind wonders: \u201cwhat would it be like to live in Hazardville, CT. The next thing you know, I am in Hazardville.</p>\n\n<p>4. <strong>CHANCE</strong></p>\n\n<p>Sometimes you get an unexpected call. On the other end is a good recruiter/hiring manager. So good in fact they manage to convince you that Hazardville, CT is not where you want to be but rather you need to be in Accident, MD.\u00a0You visit Accident and realize it is slightly better than Buffalo and anything better than Buffalo can work and you find yourself there.</p>\n\n<p>I really enjoy supply chain. More so now that I feel like I have a slight idea of what I am doing. I am never the subject matter expert in most things supply chain but from Materials, Planning, Purchasing, Sourcing, Transportation to Finance and IT \u2013 I can walk into any of those rooms and bring something to the table. That is one of the biggest advantages to what other people may perceive as a weakness on the resume.\u00a0As a manager, I take it upon myself to keep my people inspired. Retention however goes beyond being inspired and it is not a one size fits all.</p>\n\n<p><em>What we bring to the table as millennials is experience outside of your companies four walls.
