Most of them are not appreciated even as candidates who pass with flying colours are raised shoulder high in the eyes of the camera.\n\nAppreciating their effort reminds them that their impact goes beyond the classroom. This is what we realised when Mr Mangala bade us goodbye. After twelve years of teaching Mathematics at our High School, it was time to let him go.\n\nMr Mangala was a legend. I heard about him on my first day as a Form One, while I was unpacking my bags as the Form Four girl, Gladys, with who we shared a cubicle spread my bed.\n\n\u201cHe makes you laugh in class and teaches mathematics like music. He actually does not refer to any textbook. Stories have it that he was part of the conference that drafted all mathematics textbooks used from Form One to Form Four.\n\n\u201cTrust me, Amara. I wish he teaches you,\u201d Gladys told me. I was curious, so were we, all Form Ones, four years ago.\n\nBut now, I felt like my world was crushing. Everyone was, from teachers to cooks, to students. Mr Mangala had received his transfer letter from the Ministry. In as much as he was heading to be a deputy principal in another school, in a far county, for us this was like the end of a day.\n\nA sombre mood engulfed us when we, his class, learnt about it, nearly four months to sitting the KCSE exam in March 2022.\n\nMr Mangala had been our class teacher since Form One, walking with us year after year.\n\nKenyan students celebrate KCSE results in the past\nFile\n\nSitting on a desk in the front corner, he looked at us through his spectacles and I bet, trust me, I saw a tear in his eyes.\n\n\u201cDecember 23 will be my last day here as we close to break for the Christmas holiday,\u201d Mr Mangala stated. \u201cI never thought I will leave before you. I met some of you since day one. Some left some joined us midway and it has been a great journey,\u201d he added.\n\nIt was a great journey indeed.

Other factors include consumer demand, land prices, the economy among others.\n\nConsequently, these trends influence developers within the real estate industry as they seek to build homes as per the tenants' needs.\n\nFile\n\nBuying Houses Instead of Renting\n\nAs Kenyans look to cut down on their expenses, many are opting to buy houses instead of renting houses. This is because buying is cheaper in the long term as compared to paying rent each month.\n\nAdditionally, renting a house comes with many uncertainties such as the increase in rent which is determined by the landlords.\n\nA report released by Knight Frank in December 2020, stated that the pandemic gave buyers time to reflect on how they live and use their space, influencing their future buying plans.\n\n\u201cBuyers are prioritising greater privacy, outdoor space, and a home office.

People also opt for bigger houses because of the flexibility that comes with them.\n\n\u201cMost of the big houses you will find are in leafy suburbs because families opt to have a quiet life that may not be experienced in some estated. Therefore, for the big house people are going to estates which may be considered as family-friendly estates,\u201d Ogutu stated.\n\nCongestion in Leafy Suburbs\n\nReal estate company Knight Frank in February 2021, stated that wealthy Kenyans were deserting rich suburbs like Runda and Kitisuru due to the influx of new residents in the areas.\n\nThese rich tenants relocated to Tigoni in Kiambu County and Miotoni in Karen, Nairobi. They were also reported to be purchasing second homes in Tigoni and Miotoni which are spacious and allow them to convert spaces into office rooms.\n\nAreas such as Kileleshwa, Kilimani, Hurlingham, and Lavington which were previously considered high-end areas, have also witnessed the construction of skyscraper residential areas.\n\nFile\n\nSatellite Towns and Land Prices\n\nAnother notable trend is the increasing demand for houses within satellite towns neighboring cities. This demand has seen the prices of land in the towns rise as developers seek to venture into real estate in those areas to match the growing housing demands from Kenyans.\n\nAccording to HassConsult Property index, prices of land in satellite towns neighboring Nairobi rose by 2.48 percent between July to September 2021.\n\nIn Ogutu's view, while some of the satellite towns could be ancestral homes for some Kenyans, people opt to sell their pieces of land because of the pressure that comes with being surrounded by high rise buildings\n\n\"For example in Kabete, in as much as that may be the ancestral home of some people, they often tend to sell the land to developers or potential buyers because of the pressure that comes with the increasing highrise buildings in the area,\" he stated.\n\nHassConsult Property index, prices of land in centers neighboring the capital such as Syokimau, Kiambu, and Kiserian spiked by 2.48 percent between July to September 2021.\n\n\u201cSatelite areas will keep on attracting residents in 2022. We have witnessed major growth in the sale of lands in Ruiru and Kamakis areas. Infrastructure like the Thika superhighway and other bypasses have opened such areas, coupled with affordable prices for homes and land,\" Moses Muriithi, CEO at Fanaka Real Estate told Kenyans.co.ke.\n\nConstruction of Smaller Houses\n\nA report by the Kenya National Bureau of Statistics (KNBS) in 2020 revealed that developers in Nairobi are building smaller houses such as bedsitters, single rooms, and one-bedroom houses to beat the demand for these house units among city residents.\n\nFile\nReuters\n\nWithin a span of four years from 2015, there was an 84 percent increase in the number of one-bedroom units built in Nairobi. The increase in the demand for smaller houses is because they are affordable to many residents.\n\nFor example, on average a single room or a bedsitter ranges from Ksh5,000 to Ksh7,000 across the estates in Nairobi with one-bedroom apartments ranging from Ksh8,000 to Ksh10,000.\n\nAffordable Houses\n\nWith the harsh economic times, many Kenyans are also opting for affordable houses. Under the Big Four Agenda, President Uhuru Kenyatta has undertaken to build affordable houses in various cities within the country.\n\nMost of the houses have already been occupied with the government hinting that they will gradually undertake the project in phases with the target being 2030. This means that while the option of cheaper government houses may be available to Kenyans, many will miss out because of the high demand.\n\nHouses under Uhuru\u2019s affordable housing range from Ksh1 million for one-bedroom houses to Ksh3 million for a three-bedroom house.\n\nIn the interview, Ogutu added that in the future, Kenyans will opt for new technologies such as 3D printing which guarantee them houses within the shortest time and are affordable.\n\nOn December 6, Principal Secretary for the State Department for Housing and Urban Development Charles Hinga launched the first 3D printed house in Kenya with one to three-bedroom house units estimated to cost Ksh2.3 million.\n\nA 3D printer can complete a wall within 12 hours as compared to four days when using builders.\n\nTree No. 0 , Kenya's first 3D printed house constructed in Athi River\nFile\nConstruction Kenya", "articleBodyHtml": "<article>\n\n<ul><li><p>Prospective home buyers and builders will be affected by several housing trends in 2022, as indicated by several surveys that analysed the market in 2021.\u00a0</p><p>For many Kenyans, getting a house that suits their demands is one of the top priorities.

She has a case to answer\u2026\u201d\n\nI don\u2019t remember the rest of his words as my mind was now racing. Several thoughts crossed my mind. The only reason we get lost in our thoughts is when we are passing through unfamiliar territories.\n\nThoughts are not feelings, they are ideas of how you should feel, right? When thoughts and feelings get confused, the truth becomes clouded and lost.\n\nBut what truth was I even thinking about? \u201cA case to answer\u2026\u201d the principal\u2019s words reverberated in my mind.\n\n\u201cJasmine! Jasmine! What have you done my dear daughter?\u201d I wondered as I rushed to get my car out of the driveway.\n\nMy wife followed, running behind me, wondering what in the world was I up to. I had just deserted breakfast, picked my car keys and headed out of the house.\n\n\u201cBaba Jasmine\u2026 What\u2019s wrong?\u201d she asked as I started the engine.\n\n\u201cJasmine\u2026\u201d That is all I could utter.\n\n\u201cWhat\u2019s wrong with Jasmine?\u201d she asked, holding her waist and taking a step back.\n\n\u201cThe principal just called stating that she has a case to answer. Amanda, can you imagine Jasmine of all people, my Jasmine?\u201d I looked at her expecting an answer.\n\n\u201cThen change from your pyjamas and at least take your phone with you,\u201d she responded.\n\nTwo minutes later, I was stuck in the Nairobi traffic jam with all other motorists on that Thursday morning.\n\nThoughts of the unlawful activities students had taken part in crossed my mind. The severe warning issued by the education Cabinet Secretary followed.\n\n\u201cIt looks mundane and must stop. We are not closing any schools,\" the CS vowed. Was my Jasmine roped in a case?\n\nThis traffic was giving me a headache. I wished a VIP would pass so that the road would be cleared, then I would tag along and speed behind them past the traffic snarl. Even an ambulance would do better. I wondered where they were when I needed them the most.\n\nBy then, adrenaline was still pumping in my veins and everything I wanted to do was to push my senses and levels of the natural self. But I couldn\u2019t. I felt like flooring the pedal.\n\nA matatu honked. The driver muted a few words I couldn\u2019t comprehend. He was seemingly angry.\n\nI rolled down the window and heard him shout: \u201cGet out of the way! Drive!\u201d I wanted to shout back only to realise that I was static yet the traffic lights had turned green.\n\nI wondered if, inside the PSV, there was a passenger who was running late, thus forcing the driver to speed. Those times when you are inside a matatu and you get angry at the driver for stopping for ten minutes to pick passengers at an undesignated terminus.\n\nJasmine\u2019s school was buzzing with activity. I saw one parent hug her daughter. There was something in that simple hug that warmed the mother\u2019s heart.\n\nOne parent was laughing with two other students besides their car. The smile started from his lips, a grin spread to his eyes and a chuckle came from his belly. They were all laughing heartily. A good laugh bursts forth from the soul, overflows, and bubbles all around.\n\nAnother parent was dragging her daughter\u2019s suitcase, heading home to be together for three days.\n\nI parked beside the administration and headed into the principal\u2019s office. The secretary asked me to wait for a few minutes as the headteacher was occupied, listening to a parent\u2019s request.\n\n\u201cThat\u2019s what CBC (Competency-Based Curriculum) demands,\u201d I heard the principal say as he opened the door and bade goodbye to the guardian and his daughter.\n\n\u201cPlease come in,\u201d he asked me to enter his office. He shouldn\u2019t even have asked. I rushed into the office and sat, looking pensive.\n\nI introduced myself and reminded him that we had met a few times before. I rarely went to Jasmine\u2019s school. My wife Amanda was a regular.\n\n\u201cYes, Baba Jasmine. I remember you. Nothing to worry about. Let me have the secretary send in for your daughter. She is one of the best students in our current Form Four lot,\u201d he stated and rang the secretary.\n\nDid I get him right? One of the best... Is this irony in its best form or\u2026\n\nJasmine appeared with a smile on her face. You should have seen her. She looked beautiful as her mother. Amanda and I always debate on whose smile she took. Amanda always wins, but I am sure she always cheats.\n\n\u201cHave a seat Jasmine, kindly tell your parents what you have been up to,\u201d the principal stated.\n\nThere it was. The bombshell. I thought. The room was silent, my heart was racing. This would be the first time Jasmine had been caught up in a scandal at school.\n\n\u201cI received a call from Life Music, they want me to join them on a three-day tour as I benchmark on music and composition, getting ready for my musical exams,\u201d Jasmine stated.\n\n\u201cWhat!\u201d I thought I didn\u2019t hear her clearly. She repeated.\n\n\u201cIs this the case she has to answer?\u201d I asked. The principal and Jasmine looked at each other and burst into laughter.\n\nI looked at them for a few minutes and laughed too. But I didn\u2019t know what we were laughing about.\n\n\u201cIt was a prank daddy,\u201d she stated in between her laughter. \u201cI knew I wouldn\u2019t convince you about this at home. You and mummy would have declined to let me go,\u201d she stated.\n\nI looked at Jasmine and smiled. This girl will finish me one day. She adored music. I wish you could hear her sing. She\u2019d been to some talent shows on TV in Kenya and was ranked among the top.\n\nBut joining a band on a tour, in her last year in school was a big NO!\n\n\u201cI know we said I would take a break first. But this is so big for me,\u201d she pleaded looking at the principal for help. I yielded because she had already channeled my anger at the prank. I didn\u2019t have the energy to argue.\n\nThe principal added that she was related to one of the band members who would keep an eye on her.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s okay,\u201d I added, promising to convince her mother.\n\nIt then rang in my mind. Neither Amanda, my wife, nor I, thought of it. Promise that you won\u2019t laugh. We did not think of calling the principal to inquire what the issue was. As a parent, I bet, the one thing we all dread is hearing that our children have been caught up in a scandal at school.\n\n\u201cAs you are still here. Can we kindly talk about her fee arrear? This is the first time I am witnessing a delay from your end,\u201d the principal weighed in.\n\n\u201cYes. Yes. We used the money to fund some business idea and I was heading to the bank to get a loan before you pranked me,\u201d I responded.\n\nHe wondered why I was heading to the bank. And inquired where I banked. \u201c Co-operative bank,\u201d I replied.\n\n\u201cCo-op has Co-op Internet Banking where you can access all the services using your laptop, tablet, or other internet-enabled devices. You can pay all your bills directly from your Co-op bank Account!\n\n\u201cYou can also get loans, track loans, check balance and bank statement up to to 1 year. Register for Co-op Online service by clicking https://onlinebanking.co-opbank.co.ke, select personal internet banking and click on existing customers to register.\n\nShe added that for new users, registration is instant and free of charge. All you need is your National ID and any of your Co-op Bank ATM cards.\n\nThat was faster than I had thought. I realised that I could also pay my tokens, water and other bills.\n\n\u201cThank you for paying my school fees and allowing me to join Life Music pa\u2019,\u201d Jasmine stated as we headed to the car.\n\nI bet somewhere, some parents driving around also saw us laughing and felt happy for us.", "articleBodyHtml": "<article>\n\n<ul><li><p>A parent\u2019s note.\u00a0</p><p>As students headed home for the half-term break, following a crash program since schools were reopened, I was so surprised to get a call from the principal of my daughter\u2019s school.\u00a0\u00a0</p><p>\u201cCalvin, please pick your daughter at 9 am after meeting the board.

Her only companion in Abu Dhabi was Diana, a girl who worked in different houses in the same estate.\n\nThey were village mates back in Kenya, and in their free time, they conversed online. They chatted in their mother tongue which grounded their identity. They mostly discussed home affairs, and their adventures at work, and if one of them was offline during their nocturnal chats, they made sure they checked on each other.\n\nTheir bond was cemented by the fact they were all single mothers, and had left their kids back in Kenya.\n\nTwitter\n\nIn the foreign land, Grace's employer was a Sergeant in the police force, and his wife was a psychotherapist.

Her daily schedule was dynamic, as it depended on her bosses routines, but her main priority was the kids.\n\nShe often accompanied them to children's parks and joined in their frolics. Her work was literally all fun and games. It surprised her that most parents allowed their kids to play in the parks at night.\n\nThe first night she took the kids to the park, she met with Diana. They had not seen each other for months, and after they tightly embraced each other as if to quench the thirst inside their hearts, they sat on the park bench and watched as kids played.\n\nGrace gave Diana a momentary glimpse, saw the sadness in her eyes, and asked about her relationship with her employer. Diana grimaced and her expressions exposed the tip of an abuse iceberg. She then said she was tired of housework and would prefer a job that challenged her mentally. In reality, She was tired of how she lived on the leash of her rich employers who constantly argued, the reason being the wife had not borne a child.\n\nThey projected their frustrations on her, and the repercussions it had on her mental health were dire.

This trend worried her parents, and whenever they contacted her phone went on voicemail. And the days when the call went through they'd hear the sadness in her voice even though she claimed she was okay.\n\nThe day she met with Grace at the park was the first time she shared her work experience in detail, and cried a river afterwards. The talk cleared the fog in her mind, and she decided she had to take the right course of action, which was to be or not to be a housemaid in the Middle East. It all depended on her employer's verdict.\n\nWhen she went back home that particular night, she took the bull by the horns and confronted her employers in the TV room, where she took a seat and summoned their attention. She explained to them how her current routine left her exhausted and sickly, and that she would be more effective if she took breaks in between chores.\n\nWhen she concluded her request, the couple guffawed at how funny her broken Arabic sounded.
