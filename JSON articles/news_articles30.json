This is after spending thousands of shillings on twitter influencers to prop up its chances of scooping trophies. What really is happening to the once promising TV channel?\n\nEbru television Turkish chief executive officer Dr Murat Kesign has officially called it quits at the cash strapped television station setting up the stage for one particular manager to be judged by her performance. The highly acclaimed Turkish born journalist who has been in the industry for close to two decades has already served his one month notice at the station known for its \u2018perfect match\u2019 reality show and is planning to relocate to the UK. Sources say that the outgoing CEO Dr Murat Kesign had a masterplan to turn around the station\u2019s revenues and early this year, also featured in a Eutelsat high-level meeting with Kenyan industry giants to share his experience on how to increase TV viewership in East Africa. The virtual session was moderated by the talented Nancy Kacungira. The link to the meeting is here: (it\u2019s been removed)\n\nNews of his resignation did not come as a surprise to many in the know about the company\u2019s affairs because his was one of the many resignations that have taken place within a very short period of time. Before his resignation, the IT manager and the Technical manager, both of Turkish descent and with a wealth of experience spanning years, had called it quits leaving many junior staffers shocked at the move which very much seemed coordinated. The TV channel is owned on a 50-50 basis between Turkish and Kenyan investors. Ms Anarb Ahmed, the operations supervisor is said to be the one running everything at the channel as the media industry becomes extremely volatile for new players.\n\nShe even plans the budget for the stations popular dating show, cooking show, hosts and anchors\u2019 transport and has been accused before of interfering with editorial decisions at the expense of experienced journalists and topical analysts. For example, even with the current newsroom being headed by a team that is experienced and highly equipped to run things, she still calls the basic shots. The former lecturer at Umma university, decides the type of news that go on air, what will be cooked in the cooking show and how perfect match will be like, all that while fighting with all staffers to take the lead role in anything that concerns the station. No one in the company has a permanent role, apart from madam or mathe, as she is popularly known. Accountants and marketers have been the most targeted and the company advertises for their positions after every two weeks. County news correspondents have not been spared either and one can tell from the quality of the station\u2019s county news reviews.\n\nIt is alleged that she likes useless gossip and will often discuss employees\u2019 issues with other employees to try and divide and rule. Political analyst Benji Ndolo called her out for what he said was dishonesty on her part. A CCTV video of the controversial Ndolo even surfaced online suggesting there was a physical altercation between him and the lady. Although Ndolo is said to be shallow and aggressive, it is said that the supervisor has created a very toxic working environment and even orchestrated the firing of Ndolo\u2019s former soft spoken producer Beverly Vusta, who many allege cannot harm a fly. Beverly is said to have been under so much stress from the overall operations supervisor.\n\nLast year, Primetime news anchors Diana Rachel Wairimu and Erick Munene also called it quits in a huff. Diana even went public about her resignation calling out \u2018toxic bosses\u2019 without specifying who it was she was referring to. Those we spoke to told us it was Arnab Ahmed running the station like a kiosk.\n\nBack to Kuza awards. It is important to note that the station has in the past won several awards for excellent journalism. That is now in history as the operations supervisor sacked Victor Moturi and investigative reporter Francis Odii who won awards for the channel for many years. Moturi was a regular on MCK\u2019s cr\u00e8me de la cr\u00e8me, and Odii won several awards from Kuza. What was the reason for their sacking? The supervisor can\u2019t even explain it herself. Her free hand was however cut short when employees anonymously drafted a protest letter to the board of management.\n\nBy the way, the board of management is quite serious. Keen on improving the station\u2019s dwindling fortunes, the Kenyan side of the power sharing arrangement also brought in experienced media owner Peter Munga as a consultant. Munga is credited with single handedly launching Parastatal TV Kenya which did not make it to the apex of successful Kenyan TV channels.\n\nHe also resigned in late 2020 after an altercation with the operations supervisor Anarb. Anarb is said to have bragged that she can single handedly change the station\u2019s fortunes, but since she got the free hand to do things her way after the CEO resigned, things have gotten worse. Many people working in the media house are said to have worked for months with no pay as the HR now pays staffers in phases. Her inexperience and useless ego will only ruin things more but she is quite lucky that she has covid/pandemic to blame. Only the gullible and stupid will believe her though. The station was ALREADY suffering from her bad decisions even before the pandemic struck.\n\nSources within and without the station claim that the lady single handedly runs all departments within the company and for you to gain her favour you have to be a \u2018yes\u2019 person. Should you be any different to her style of supervision, you allegedly become a target of her attacks. You can be accused of anything from stealing, insubordination, wrong dress code, and lately, staffers have been told not to pick or make phone calls within the precincts of the company because they could be plotting to bring her down.\n\nNew TV stations like TV 47 and Switch TV are slowly eating into the station\u2019s market share as recently seen at the Kuza Awards, leaving those in the company confused. The Samuel Gicharu- owned TV 47 channel raided Ebru and poached breakfast host Linda Alela and talented sports journalist Dennis Omondi. Both Switch and TV 47 have dedicated marketers raking in millions from advertisers every month, while Ebru only runs promotions for its own programs because the operations supervisor is also the chief marketer, acting CEO, chief accountant, editor in chief, perfect match producer, head of IT etc.\n\nMultiple sources who talked to us anonymously say that in a classic case of \u201cwhen you want to kill a dog, give it a bad name\u201d, she regularly holds department meetings to soil the name of those she hates, preparing the ground for their illegal sacking. They then will be given warning letters in quick succession before being dismissed. Other workers will be lied to and because they can\u2019t question anything, the targeted ones look as evil as they can get. If you ask her for proof of whatever allegations she makes, she fumbles without substance.\n\nWhat is funny though, is that when she realizes her misdeeds, she calls those she fired earlier and offers them back their jobs. If they are desperate, they go back. She is said to have told her close relatives that the investment is the single biggest mistake they ever made as a family.

After Nairobi, the next leading closures are in Nakuru, Kitengela & Kiambu counties.\n\nFirst and foremost, Uhuru began implementing the curfew a long time ago. He ensured that street lights in all towns don\u2019t function by prevailing upon EACC and DPP not to prosecute corrupt governors. He then sent a memo to the Police IG through Interior PS, asking police to arrest anyone found walking outside after 8pm under the guise of \u201cloitering\u201d.\n\nMany years ago during the Kenyatta years of prosperity, we used to drink and club-hop on foot. We would start drinking at Hornbill and then walk to Florida 1000 (mad-house) to finish off the night. Back then, all streets were lit, and police would provide security not harass, extort or arrest civilians.\n\nIn short, Uhuru has been implementing soft Sharia Laws in the country.\n\nThe current Governor of Nakuru is Lee Kinyanjui, whose previous posting was chairman of the National Transportation and Safety Agency (NTSA). He was the enforcer of Uhuru\u2019s Alcoblow agenda, which saw all clubs in Nairobi CBD closed. At the time, it was alleged that he received bribes from members of the Somali community, who were undertaking a \u201cscorched earth\u201d policy of depriving Nairobi bars of clientele through Alcoblow, manipulating the price of real-estate downwards and then acquiring these prime properties for a song.\n\nThe current Governor of Kajiado is Joseph Ole Lenku, a former CS Interior, which at the time, was the enforcing agency of Alcoblow, together with NTSA. The inherent contempt of young people as manifested in skewed policies traces its origins back to Harambee House, where Lenku served. Of late, we have been having immense complaints about Kajiado County and police harassment of liquor store owners and we can now draw the parallel of what is happening in areas like Ongare Rongai, with what Ole Lenku did as CS Interior.\n\nKiambu County then follows closely with Thika Town being the hardest hit. Former Governor William Kabogo has since morphed into an online influencer. We remember how he scampered to safety after lighting a consignment of liquor that had been forcefully collected from bars, liquor stores and manufacturers. Despite his cosmetic bravado, Kabogo was a diehard implementer of Uhuru\u2019s misguided policies relating to alcohol and bars, in a bid to keep his illicit/illegal businesses afloat.\n\nRecently President Uhuru Kenyatta visited his real-estate development along Kiambu Road, a project which has taken 10 years to complete. Only a fool would buy anything from a conman like Kabogo.\n\nIf each of the closed outlets employed a minimum of 20 people directly, it is easy to quantify the exact extent of Uhuru\u2019s economic genocide on young people.\n\nWe are working on a major analysis of these closures so please add names of other bars, clubs and restaurants we may have missed out.", "articleBodyHtml": "<article>\n\n<p><strong>Draft list of bars &amp; restaurants closed since Uhuru was elected into office in 2013 due to Alcoblow, police harassment, poor economic climate and non-payment of suppliers for Government/County tenders.\u00a0</strong></p>\n\n<p><strong>Nairobi County</strong></p>\n\n<ol><li>Simmers</li>\n<li>Tacos</li>\n<li>Tropez</li>\n<li>Verandah</li>\n<li>Kengeles</li>\n<li>Sherlock\u2019s Den</li>\n<li>Princess</li>\n<li>Dodi\u2019s</li>\n<li>Zeep</li>\n<li>Zanze</li>\n<li>Mojos</li>\n<li>Sevens</li>\n<li>Club Rumours</li>\n<li>Club Thunder</li>\n<li>Nectar</li>\n<li>Zanze</li>\n<li>Attitude</li>\n<li>Winkers</li>\n<li>Swols</li>\n<li>Farhrenheit Embakasi Village</li>\n<li>Club Batis Tom Mboya</li>\n<li>Sabina Joy</li>\n<li>Steps Luthuli Avenue</li>\n<li>Apple Bees Munyu Road</li>\n<li>Polo Club at the Hilton</li>\n<li>Oasis</li>\n<li>Zodiac</li>\n<li>Edge</li>\n<li>Wine Bar</li>\n<li>Samba</li>\n<li>Black Diamond Westlands</li>\n<li>Red-Tape Westlands</li>\n<li>Bacchus Lounge</li>\n<li>Changes Westlands</li>\n<li>Club Qatika Westlands</li>\n<li>Supermambo Ngara</li>\n<li>Kitindo North Airport Road</li>\n<li>Maxland</li>\n<li>Clanix Mfangano Street</li>\n<li>TanagerB-Club Kilimani</li>\n<li>Kiza Lounge Kilimani</li>\n<li>RoadHouse Kilimani</li>\n<li>Taurus Lounge Buruburu</li>\n<li>Giggles</li>\n<li>Tribeka</li>\n<li>Red Robin</li>\n<li>Monaco Kasarani</li>\n<li>Waves Lounge Tom Mboya</li>\n<li>Bavon</li>\n<li>Space Lounge Ngong Road</li>\n<li>Natives Thika Road</li>\n<li>OlDivai 44</li>\n<li>Mojos</li>\n<li>Psy\u2019s Langata Raod</li>\n<li>Zingi Utawala</li>\n<li>Gates Utawala</li>\n<li>Summit Grill Utawala</li>\n<li>Utah Gardens Utawala</li>\n<li>Club One Two Many Utawala</li>\n<li>Kitindo Utawala</li>\n<li>Visa Place Upper Hill</li>\n<li>Shebeen Upper Hill</li>\n<li>Florida 1 &amp; 2</li>\n<li>Nyanza House</li>\n<li>Harry\u2019s Tavern Umoja</li>\n<li>Smoothers Hotel</li>\n<li>Shade Hotel</li>\n<li>Sips Outdoors</li>\n<li>Chomazone Thika Road</li>\n<li>Rafikiz Langata</li>\n<li>Banditoz Westlands</li>\n<li>Pavement Westlands</li>\n<li>Jikoni\u2019s Kiambu Road</li></ol>\n\n<p><strong>Kajiado County</strong></p>\n\n<ol><li>Club 411 Kitengela</li>\n<li>Bailey\u2019s Kitengela</li>\n<li>Club Thunder Kitengela</li>\n<li>Club 411 Kitengela</li>\n<li>Dreams Makuti Kitengela</li>\n<li>Wrens Club Kitengela</li>\n<li>Tropicana Club Kitengela</li>\n<li>Empire Club Kitengela</li>\n<li>3D Club Kitengela</li>\n<li>Sherehe Launch Rongai</li>\n<li>Club Nyambene Kajiado Town</li></ol>\n\n<p><strong>Nakuru County</strong></p>\n\n<ol><li>Bubbles Naivasha</li>\n<li>Country House Inn Naivasha</li>\n<li>Club Sting Nakuru</li>\n<li>Club Sixty Four (64) Nakuru</li>\n<li>Club Samba</li>\n<li>Rafikiz</li>\n<li>Samba Kitoko Nakuru</li>\n<li>Taidy\u2019s Nakuru</li>\n<li>Grill Park Club Nakuru</li>\n<li>Eserian Nakuru</li>\n<li>Courtyard Nakuru</li>\n<li>Freddies Foods, Nakuru</li></ol>\n\n<p><strong>Kakamega County</strong></p>\n\n<ol><li>Club Mint</li>\n<li>Club Hush</li>\n<li>Baccadiz Lounge</li>\n<li>Club Martini</li>\n<li>Belsibo</li>\n<li>Marende Pub Tonyoto</li>\n<li>Mzungu Club Kwanza</li></ol>\n\n<p><strong>Mombasa County</strong></p>\n\n<ol><li>Bottoms Up Shanzu</li>\n<li>Bob\u2019s</li>\n<li>Back Water</li>\n<li>Masters</li>\n<li>Fun Fun</li>\n<li>Lambada Mtwapa</li>\n<li>Shots Bamburi</li>\n<li>Maswa Bar</li></ol>\n\n<p><strong>Kilifi County</strong></p>\n\n<ol><li>The Vogue</li></ol>\n\n<p><strong>Kisumu County\u00a0</strong></p>\n\n<ol><li>Club Budddy\u2019s United Mall</li>\n<li>The Hague \u2013 Kendu Bay</li></ol>\n\n<p><strong>Kiambu County\u00a0</strong></p>\n\n<ol><li>Club Zinc Thika</li>\n<li>Club Legend Thika</li>\n<li>Thorntons Thika</li>\n<li>Beat House Thika</li>\n<li>Everton Thika</li>\n<li>Nanasi Thika</li>\n<li>Metro-Fil Thika</li>\n<li>500 Degrees Ananas Mall Thika</li>\n<li>Coconut Grill Thika</li>\n<li>The Maze Thika</li>\n<li>Tamasha Thika</li>\n<li>MK Club Thika</li>\n<li>Pepino Thika</li>\n<li>Equino Thika</li>\n<li>D Space Uthiru</li>\n<li>Luton Tavern Ruiru</li>\n<li>Las Colinas Kikuyu Town</li></ol>\n\n<p><strong>Eldoret County</strong></p>\n\n<ol><li>Black Bamboo Cocktails</li>\n<li>Black Ball</li>\n<li>Signature</li></ol>\n\n<p><strong>Kericho County</strong></p>\n\n<ol><li>Exclusive Club</li>\n<li>Basement</li>\n<li>Amallo</li>\n<li>Whispers</li></ol>\n\n<p><strong>Machakos\u00a0</strong></p>\n\n<ol><li>Kay\u2019s Pub</li>\n<li>Katumba\u2019s Bar &amp; Restaurants</li></ol>\n\n<p><strong>Meru\u00a0</strong></p>\n\n<ol><li>Club Kimwa \u2013 Chuka</li></ol>\n\n<p>Have we missed out any?

Back then, all streets were lit, and police would provide security not harass, extort or arrest civilians.</p>\n\n<p>In short, Uhuru has been implementing soft Sharia Laws in the country.</p>\n\n<p>The current Governor of Nakuru is Lee Kinyanjui, whose previous posting was chairman of the National Transportation and Safety Agency (NTSA). He was the enforcer of Uhuru\u2019s Alcoblow agenda, which saw all clubs in Nairobi CBD closed. At the time, it was alleged that he received bribes from members of the Somali community, who were undertaking a \u201cscorched earth\u201d policy of depriving Nairobi bars of clientele through Alcoblow, manipulating the price of real-estate downwards and then acquiring these prime properties for a song.</p>\n\n<p>The current Governor of Kajiado is Joseph Ole Lenku, a former CS Interior, which at the time, was the enforcing agency of Alcoblow, together with NTSA. The inherent contempt of young people as manifested in skewed policies traces its origins back to Harambee House, where Lenku served. Of late, we have been having immense complaints about Kajiado County and police harassment of liquor store owners and we can now draw the parallel of what is happening in areas like Ongare Rongai, with what Ole Lenku did as CS Interior.</p>\n\n<p>Kiambu County then follows closely with Thika Town being the hardest hit. Former Governor William Kabogo has since morphed into an online influencer. We remember how he scampered to safety after lighting a consignment of liquor that had been forcefully collected from bars, liquor stores and manufacturers. Despite his cosmetic bravado, Kabogo was a diehard implementer of Uhuru\u2019s misguided policies relating to alcohol and bars, in a bid to keep his illicit/illegal businesses afloat.</p>\n\n<p>Recently President Uhuru Kenyatta visited his real-estate development along Kiambu Road, a project which has taken 10 years to complete. Only a fool would buy anything from a conman like Kabogo.</p>\n\n<p>If each of the closed outlets employed a minimum of 20 people directly, it is easy to quantify the exact extent of Uhuru\u2019s economic genocide on young people.</p>\n\n<p>We are working on a major analysis of these closures so please add names of other bars, clubs and restaurants we may have missed out.</p>\n\n</article>", "canonicalUrl": "https://www.cnyakundi.com/unlockourcountry-provisional-list-of-bars-restaurants-which-closed-after-uhuru-became-president/"},{"url": "https://www.cnyakundi.com/azziad-nasenya-caught-flaunting-fake-curves/", "probability": 0.99392104, "headline": "Azziad Nasenya Caught Flaunting Fake Curves", "datePublished": "2021-07-26T00:00:00", "datePublishedRaw": "2021-07-26", "dateModified": "2021-07-26T00:00:00", "dateModifiedRaw": "2021-07-26", "author": "Zowan", "authorsList": ["Zowan"], "inLanguage": "en", "mainImage": "https://i0.wp.com/www.cnyakundi.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/InShot_20210726_223006200-scaled.jpg?resize=1024%2C576&ssl=1", "images": ["https://i1.wp.com/www.cnyakundi.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/220px-azziad_nasenya_in_20206743665819780610759.jpg?resize=220%2C275&ssl=1", "https://i0.wp.com/www.cnyakundi.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/screenshot_20210726-214956_instagram2444400813575224758.jpg?resize=720%2C512&ssl=1", "https://i2.wp.com/www.cnyakundi.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/20210726_2143191704022445002262218.jpg?resize=880%2C1905&ssl=1", "https://i2.wp.com/www.cnyakundi.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/screenshot_20210726-214820_instagram8273321129850590402.jpg?resize=720%2C910&ssl=1", "https://i2.wp.com/www.cnyakundi.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/screenshot_20210726-214903_instagram6127005915736847533.jpg?resize=720%2C935&ssl=1", "https://i1.wp.com/www.cnyakundi.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/screenshot_20210726-220906_twitter6355188708462816814.jpg?resize=720%2C233&ssl=1", "https://i0.wp.com/www.cnyakundi.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/screenshot_20210726-220745_twitter6425464339744692082.jpg?resize=720%2C235&ssl=1", "https://i2.wp.com/www.cnyakundi.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/screenshot_20210726-220817_twitter699373819409336645.jpg?resize=720%2C275&ssl=1"], "description": "CAPTION: Kenyan actress, content creator, media host and social media personality Azziad Nasenya Is Kenya's Tik-Tok Queen Azziad Nasenya facing some self-esteem issues?

mysterious discovery of dead bodies retrieved from the deep ends of River Yala.\n\nThe corpses recovered almost every other day are said to be slowly building up at the Yala Sub County Hospital mortuary where they are surprisingly ferried by police vehicles.\n\nAccording to a local who raised alarm on social media, a close confidant with links to the health facility disclosed that the bodies are often marked as \u201cunclaimed\u201d and later dumped in mass graves by the county government.\n\nThrough a series of tweets published on Friday, December 10, 2021, Joel Mbirika revealed that most of the bodies retrieved are of young male adults with an estimated average age of 30 years.\n\nQuoting his source at the Yala Sub County Hospital mortuary, he added that most of the exhumed bodies were attached to heavy loads; which depicts that they were dumped with intentions to disappear them for good.\n\nWhat is more shocking is the fresh-looking bodies devoid of any physical injuries hardly tally any description of missing persons from the area.\n\nSince none of the locals seems to claim any of the corpses, they end up staying for many days unattended before being cleared off for disposal.\n\nThis leaves no room for carrying out a postmortem test.\n\nIn the latest discovery, the body of a well dressed young man was brought to the facility on Monday 6th November 2021, with several identification marks including a wedding ring on his finger and a bracelet of the Kenyan flag on this other arm.\n\nThis was clearly a foreigner.\n\nHe believes that if sufficient information is provided by the health facilities as well as legal authorities and their agents who recover the bodies, it would help solve a lot of puzzles of missing persons countrywide.\n\nAt the moment, over 17 bodies at the Yala Sub County Hospital mortuary are awaiting to be cleared for burying.\n\nCheck out his full thread below.\n\nThe office of the Directorate of Criminal Investigations (DCI) as well as other relevant authorities in the county are urged to into the matter and deliver closure to the distraught families with missing kin.", "articleBodyHtml": "<article>\n\n<figure><img

deep ends of River Yala.</p>\n\n<p>The corpses recovered almost every other day are said to be slowly building up at the Yala Sub County Hospital mortuary where they are surprisingly ferried by police vehicles.</p>\n\n<p>According to a local who raised alarm on social media, a close confidant with links to the health facility disclosed that the bodies are often marked as \u201cunclaimed\u201d and later dumped in mass graves by the county government.</p>\n\n<p>Through a series of tweets published on Friday, December 10, 2021, Joel Mbirika revealed that most of the bodies retrieved are of young male adults with an estimated average age of 30 years.</p>\n\n<p>Quoting his source at the Yala Sub County Hospital mortuary, he added that most of the exhumed bodies were attached to heavy loads; which depicts that they were dumped with intentions to disappear them for good.</p>\n\n<p>What is more shocking is the fresh-looking bodies devoid of any physical injuries hardly tally any description of missing persons from the area.</p>\n\n<p>Since none of the locals seems to claim any of the corpses, they end up staying for many days unattended before being cleared off for disposal.</p>\n\n<p>This leaves no room for carrying out a postmortem test.</p>\n\n<p>In the latest discovery, the body of a well dressed young man was brought to the facility on Monday 6th November 2021, with several identification marks including a wedding ring on his finger and a bracelet of the Kenyan flag on this other arm.</p>\n\n<p>This was clearly a foreigner.</p>\n\n<p>He believes that if sufficient information is provided by the health facilities as well as legal authorities and their agents who recover the bodies, it would help solve a lot of puzzles of missing persons countrywide.</p>\n\n<p>At the moment, over 17 bodies at the Yala Sub County Hospital mortuary are awaiting to be cleared for burying.</p>\n\n<p>Check out his full thread below.</p>\n\n<figure><img

looking into scathing allegations of gross irregularities during the recruitment of senior managers, their deputies and commissioners at the commission.", "articleBody": "The Teachers Service Commission (TSC) has come under fire following claims of prevailing tribal favouritism at the state department.\n\nAn investigation by the office of the Ombudsman is looking into scathing allegations of gross irregularities during the recruitment of senior managers, their deputies and commissioners.\n\nThe move by The Commission on Administrative Justice (CAJ) chaired by Florence Kajuju was inspired by a petition filed by Pauline Mumbua who argues the appointed top TSC hierarchy does not represent the face of Kenya.\n\nAccording to the petition, one specific region is strongly favoured which is contrary to the constitution and the National Cohesion and Integration Act of 2008.\n\n\u201cWhereas the commissioners and senior managers are supposed to reflect the face of Kenya, the current composition at TSC gives a different picture,\u201d reads part of the petition.\n\nAlso involved in the case is the Director of Criminal Investigation (DCI) boss George Kinoti as well as the Director of Public Prosecutions (ODPP) Noordin Haji who both received a copy of the letter dated December 2 2021.\n\nThey have been asked to investigate and establish how almost half of the 11 senior managers come from the Mt Kenya region.\n\nThe group includes the commission\u2019s CEO Nancy Macharia, Staffing Director Rita Wahome, her Quality Assurance counterpart Rueuben Mugwuku, Charles Gichira heading ICT, as well as Isaak Ng\u2019ang\u2019a of the Internal Audit department.\n\n\u201cWhen you take a close look at the composition of senior managers and commissioners at the TSC, it is evident that Mount Kenya region is favoured as it has the lion\u2019s share,\u201d she adds in the petition.\n\nIn the list shared in the petition, only two positions are occupied by members of the

prevailing tribal favouritism at the state department.</p>\n\n<p>An investigation by the office of the Ombudsman is looking into scathing allegations of gross irregularities during the recruitment of senior managers, their deputies and commissioners.</p>\n\n<p>The move by <a href=\"https://www.ombudsman.go.ke/\">The Commission on Administrative Justice (CAJ)</a> chaired by Florence Kajuju was inspired by a petition filed by Pauline Mumbua who argues the appointed top TSC hierarchy does not represent the face of Kenya.</p>\n\n<p>According to the petition, one specific region is strongly favoured which is contrary to the constitution and the National Cohesion and Integration Act of 2008.</p>\n\n<p><strong>\u201cWhereas the commissioners and senior managers are supposed to reflect the face of Kenya, the current composition at TSC gives a different picture,\u201d</strong> reads part of the petition.</p>\n\n<p>Also involved in the case is the Director of Criminal Investigation (DCI) boss George Kinoti as well as the Director of Public Prosecutions (ODPP) Noordin Haji\u00a0 who both received a copy of the letter dated December 2 2021.</p>\n\n<p>They have been asked to investigate and establish how almost half of the 11 senior managers come from the Mt Kenya region.</p>\n\n<p>The group includes the commission\u2019s CEO Nancy Macharia, Staffing Director Rita Wahome, her Quality Assurance counterpart Rueuben Mugwuku, Charles Gichira heading ICT, as well as Isaak Ng\u2019ang\u2019a of the Internal Audit department.</p>\n\n<p><strong>\u201cWhen you take a close look at the composition of senior managers and commissioners at the TSC, it is evident that Mount Kenya region is favoured as it has the lion\u2019s share,\u201d</strong> she adds in the petition.</p>\n\n<p>In the list shared in the petition, only two positions are occupied by members of the Rift Valley and Nyanza communities.</p>\n\n<p>The remaining slots are shared among the rest.</p>\n\n<p>Interestingly, all the lucrative positions that come with better pay and higher trappings of power have all been allocated to those who hail from the Mountain region.</p>\n\n<p>The cartels united by greed use these

Though he was on suicide watch, he is reported to have told psychologists that he was \u2018a jew and suicide was against his religion\u2019. NY further states that he was \u201cupset about wearing an orange jumpsuit and being treated like \u2018a bad guy\u2019 when he did not do anything wrong in the prison,\u201d and reportedly enjoyed regaling inmates with tales of his high-flying social circles.\n\nThe billionaire pedophile Jeffrey Epstein was arrested in 2019 for allegedly sex trafficking dozens of minors in New York and Florida between 2002 and 2005. He was charged in a court in New York, sentenced and later died in prison allegedly by suicide.\n\nPundits argue, going by what Epstein knew, he was killed.\n\nTheir argument is catchy and very convincing in some quarters.\n\nIn the Pizzagate documentary, which rose due to the leaked Hillary Clinton emails (John Podesta emails), one thing was very curious. Why would the white house order Pizza worth over sixty thousand ($60,000) dollars?\n\nAccording to the Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI), as revealed by the expos\u00e9; Pizza is a codename for male underage boys.\n\nThe Epstein files also exposed Kenyan ranches, (those places that are hard to visit for the common mwananchi and law enforcement) most of them in Laikipia and Karen.\n\nA Kenyan of European ancestry, conservationist Kuki Gallman was named in the Epstein child trafficking scandals.\n\nJack Dorsey, the Co-founder of Twitter resigned after being pushed out for a more feminist-scam leaning CEO.\n\nThe censorship that started two years after the \u2018outsider\u2019 Donald Trump took power in Washington will culminate into a total ban of Twitter accounts and even if need be, a total worldwide internet shutdown.\n\nSome time in 2010, President Barack Obama proposed an \u2018internet kill-switch\u2019; the ability to switch off the web in USA and potentially worldwide .\n\n\u201cWe are at the verge of a great global awakening where most of the lies will be debunked, these are not normal times.

When he was first elected, he went straight for Stanley Okumbi from an unknown hole to manage the national football team, Harambee Stars.\n\nOkumbi led Stars in 16 matches and attained just one meaningful win, 2-1 against Republic of Congo in the 2017 Africa Cup of Nations qualifier played in June 2016.\n\nHe would later draw 1-1 with Zambia in another qualifier but fell twice to Guinea Bissau and finished bottom of Group E\n\nBut the FKF president kept his faith in Okumbi despite public calls to fire him. Mwendwa preferred Okumbi because he was cheap and sycophantic.\n\nOkumbi who had managed Mwendwa\u2019s Kariobangi Sharks was later replaced by Scottish Bobby Williamson who also struggled to post convincing results in serious assignments.\n\n\u201cWe might be doing poorly but we don\u2019t support this aggression doing rounds on Okumbi.

This is unacceptable,\u201d he continued.</p>\n\n<p>The Trump Media &amp; Technology Group will merge with blank check company Digital World Acquisition Corp (DWAC) to make TMTG a publicly listed company, the statement said.</p>\n\n<p>\u201cThe transaction values Trump Media &amp; Technology Group at an initial enterprise value of $875 Million, with a potential additional earnout of $825 Million in additional shares (at the valuation they are granted) for a cumulative valuation of up to $1.7 Billion depending on the performance of the stock price post-business combination,\u201d it stated.</p>\n\n<p>\u201cGiven the total addressable market and President Trump\u2019s large following, we believe the TMTG opportunity has the potential to create significant shareholder value,\u201d DWAC chief Patrick Orlando said in the statement.</p>\n\n<h2><strong>Free-speech battles\u00a0</strong></h2>\n\n<p>For years, Trump, who wielded Twitter in particular as a rhetorical weapon during his presidency, has battled tech giants whom he argues have wrongfully censored him.</p>\n\n<p>The free-speech fight escalated when Facebook, Twitter, Instagram and the rest of the world\u2019s dominant social media platforms banned him as punishment for stirring up the mob that ransacked Congress.</p>\n\n<p>Ever since, Trump has been looking for ways to reclaim his internet megaphone, launching several lawsuits against the tech giants.</p>\n\n<p>In May, he launched a blog called \u201cFrom the Desk of Donald J. Trump,\u201d which was touted as a major new outlet \u2014 but he pulled it from the internet just a month later.</p>\n\n<p>Former Trump aide Jason Miller launched a social network called Gettr earlier this year, but the Republican has not yet joined it.</p>\n\n<p>Shortly after TRUTH Social was announced, Miller congratulated Trump on \u201cre-entering the social media fray.\u201d<br>\n\u201cNow Facebook and Twitter will lose even more market share,\u201d he said in a statement tweeted by Gettr.</p>\n\n<p>Facebook banned Trump indefinitely on January 7 over his incendiary comments that preceded the Capitol insurrection, later narrowing the ban to two years.</p>\n\n<p>Twitter quickly followed, permanently suspending Trump\u2019s account \u2014 which had more than 88 million followers at the time \u2014 due to the \u201crisk of further incitement of violence.\u201d</p>\n\n<p>Trump has begun holding public events, including campaign-style rallies, as he seeks to remain the nation\u2019s most influential Republican.</p>\n\n</article>", "canonicalUrl": "https://www.cnyakundi.com/truth-social-donald-trumps-social-media-platform-gears-for-launch/"},{"url": "https://www.cnyakundi.com/flashy-south-sudanese-fraudster-lawrence-malong-sentenced-to-6-years-in-jail-over-1m-gold-scam/", "probability": 0.9973182, "headline": "Flashy South Sudanese Fraudster Lawrence Malong Sentenced To 6 Years In Jail Over $1M Gold Scam", "datePublished": "2021-08-18T00:00:00", "datePublishedRaw": "2021-08-18", "dateModified": "2021-08-18T00:00:00", "dateModifiedRaw": "2021-08-18", "author": "Karecha Kamaris", "authorsList": ["Karecha Kamaris"], "inLanguage": "en", "mainImage": "https://i0.wp.com/www.cnyakundi.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/1543213140_Malonggsgs.jpg?resize=1024%2C576&ssl=1", "images": ["https://i0.wp.com/www.cnyakundi.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/south_sudanese_tycoo5bfa7676f3797.jpg?resize=744%2C407&ssl=1"], "description": "Lual Malong Jr Flashy socialite gold scammer Lawrence Lual Malong Yor has been jailed for 6 years in Uganda.

The PP2 Trip scandal was earlier last month exposed by Cyprian Nyakundi who has been actively exposing almost all the corruption matters in the school.\n\nAll this started last week after everyone in the school confirmed that the head teacher\u2019s contract has been denied to be extended and that come January 1 st 2022, the school would mark a historical day by the exit of John Kombo (a person involved in almost all the corruption cases in the school).\n\nParents of Nyali School, a section of the board members, staff and even the security personnel in the school (off course minus a few \u201cVichuzi\u201d- Blind followers) have been in celebratory mood since learning that the corrupt man is inevitably going home. John Kombo himself hasn\u2019t come into terms with this reality and this week went missing from Wednesday with many believing that the man had gone to sought the help of known witchcrafts in Coast. Mr. Kombo who had excused himself from school sighting attendance of an urgent matter in Kitale, was seen hovering in town and South Coast in most times of last week.\n\nIt has secretly been learnt that John Kombo wants to invent a formula to convive the board to extend his term even if is for three months only. It is said he wants to use the class Eight candidates and convince their parents that his exit would jeopardize the success of their Kids. He wants to be allowed to oversee the candidates finish the class Eight exams. But the man is very strategic, once given the extension, he would do all what it takes to seek further extension of his contract. But wazazi \u201cWamekataa Kata Kata\u201d. Now Kombo is seeking the intervention of witchcraft to have this idea sail through.\n\nAmid all this drama, the poor grounds man, wished a teacher colleague quick recovery in the WhatsApp Wall for the school after the teacher experienced abdominal pain leading to vomiting of blood and hospitalization. The teacher prior to his abdominal pains spent time with an IT teacher (a close associate of Kombo) having and enjoying whisky. It is unknown what could have caused the teacher\u2019s vomiting of blood. This get-well message angered the secretary to Kombo \u2013 a lady who has been forefront supporting Kombo and who see her survival in school coming to an end once Kombo exits the school. The lady has been even using school resources to market her cloth business and also to market Paramount (a parallel school owned by Kombo). In the process, exchange of harsh words between the grounds man and the secretary ensued. After a heated exchange, the grounds man decided to share the PP2 expose by Nyakundi on the WhatsApp wall. Many saw this as a way to anger the secretary who is one of the blind-followers of the head teacher. .\n\nThis brought more fire between the two and immediately the WhatsApp wall was disbanded. The staff was then ordered by Kombo to come on Saturday 4 th December, 2021 to face the disciplinary Committee. As we speak, Nyali School has NO Disciplinary Committee. According to the Club Constitution Article 22 (a)\u2013 the disciplinary committee is consisting of seven (7) members who shall be appointed by members of the club at the Annual General Meeting. Two of the members of this Committee shall be of the Legal profession. The rules regarding the appointment and operations of the Disciplinary Committee shall be set out by the Management Committee. The Disciplinary Committee shall serve for a similar length of term as the Management Committee.\n\nNo Disciplinary committee was constituted in the last AGM. Worst, the board of Management is itself illegally in office as their term ended in March 2021. This matter has even made the Chairperson of the Board of Management distance himself from it, only for Kombo to use the Vice chairman to handle the issue. The Vice Chairman is however, very keen not to be seen being used by Kombo as he eyes the chairman position in the next AGM.\n\nHowever, Even before the staff meets the nonexistent Disciplinary Committee, Kombo has already irregularly issued a suspension letter to the Staff. It must be noted that, Kombo has no legal powers (as per the club constitution) to suspend any staff. He only has powers to advise the board of management on any staff requiring to undergo a disciplinary process. The staff has been suspended for one month pending his facing of disciplinary committee. The irony is, the staff would face the disciplinary committee when Kombo himself is out of Nyali School. It seems Kombo wants to exit the school with others whom he perceived aided his ouster. Already two more staff are on Kombo\u2019s radar for suspension. Again last year, he was involved in sacking of three (3) other non-teaching staff. These staff have since gone to industrial courts demanding for compensation. The school is likely going to be compelled to pay these staff. Collectively, the total amount demanded by those staff is over 10Million. Parents are scared that this latest case will take a similar course.\n\nIt is very disheartening that school has totally lost direction. There is no board of management to overlook the activities of the school. The chairperson only comes to school to sign cheques and disappears. Other board members have little interest in the school. In any way, their say is of little significance as the executive side of the board and Kombo always run the Show. Kombo is exiting the school, leaving it in its lowest level ever.

Of these quantities, the corporation, jointly with the State Department for Petroleum inspected and certified the use of 45,797 cylinders, 40,484 gas burners and 114,680 grills with an aggregate value of Sh56,419,124.\n\nJaffer Mohammed is a terrible man and Kenyans need to avoid his theatrics before he plunges this country into economic chaos. Jaffer made sure that NOCK was making losses and he succeeded in that. In the year to June 2020, Nock incurred an Sh142 million loss (40 per cent) compared with Sh352 million it lost in 2018/19. The Sh494.5 million loss in 2019/20 pushed Nock\u2019s losses to Sh3.05 billion.\n\n\u201cThe corporation is, therefore, technically insolvent and its continued existence as a going concern is dependent upon the financial support of the government, bankers and its creditors unless management puts in place measures to improve the performance of the corporation and to reduce reliance on financial support from the shareholders,\u201d the report says.\n\nBetween July 2017 and December 2018, Nock recorded losses of 4,097,221 litres of diesel and 341,063 litres of super petrol, valued at Sh365.9 million. In June 2019, another loss of 32,000 litres of diesel valued at Sh3.62 million was reported.\n\nJaffer Mohammed used the chaos he created at NOCK and stole 40 per cent of the remaining Mwananchi gas cylinders.\n\n\u201cThe remainder of the items had not been included in the agency\u2019s financial statements and the management has attributed the omission to lack of formal authority from the State Department for Petroleum to transfer ownership of the items to the corporation,\u201d Ms Gathungu stated in her 2018/19 Nock audit report.\n\nResponding to last year\u2019s audit queries, the Nock management blame d the state department for failing to communicate how Nock was supposed to handle the products after the 2018 handing over of the project, for the delays in distribution.\n\n\u201cThe corporation received Mwananchi gas cylinders and accessories in FY2017/18. Since there was no clear communication from the Ministry of Energy and Petroleum on how the corporation was to treat the Mwananchi gas cylinders and accessories, the cylinders and accessories were accounted for in the books as an asset (inventory) with a corresponding liability,\u201d the management said.\n\nNock said it has unsuccessfully tried writing to the state department seeking ownership of the project.\n\n\u201c Management wrote a letter to the ministry, making recommendations to address the ownership and management of cylinders and accessories, and a second letter addressing the price buildup and subsidy applied on the cylinders and accessories. This was intended to ensure that the ministry transfers ownership of the cylinders to National Oil and that the ministry also gives concurrence on the pricing of the cylinder and accessories. Approval was given by the ministry to apply a subsidy of 65 per cent on the landed cost of the cylinders and accessories in the buildup of the prices to the end-users with overall concurrence on the proposed price of Sh2,150 for a complete cylinder set.

Twitter Inc has not even taken into consideration that one might only have one phone number.\n\nIdeally emails should be the only source of account verification.\n\nOn March 17 th 2020, Twitter Safety released a justification for its illegal data collection and tracking\n\nIt wrote:\n\nAs the world faces an unprecedented public health emergency, we want to be open about the steps we\u2019re taking to keep people safe. To support social distancing and working from home, we need to work differently and rely more on automated systems to help enforce our rules.\n\nWhat this means for you: \u2013 We\u2019re working to improve our tech so it can make more enforcement calls \u2014 this might result in some mistakes. \u2013 We\u2019re meeting daily to see what changes we need to make. \u2013 We\u2019re staying engaged with partners around the world.\n\nThis is why many accounts will be locked because the twitter bot that \u2018automate systems to help enforce rules\u2019, will be asking users to verify if they are not robot.\n\nLooking at how Israel and Iran are using phone app data to track COVID-19 potential patients, it is clear what Twitter might be doing.\n\n\u201cTwitter is trying to track real accounts so that it can share that information with governments in the fight against COVID -19. Though this is illegal and an affront against civil liberties\u201d.\n\nIt should be remembered that Twitter ordered its staff to work from home.\n\nThe act of locking accounts and forcing users to provide their phone numbers to get it back is quite unproductive, annoying and illegal as blogger\n\nOkay, so it may already look as if the locked account concept is merely a means of holding users to ransom for mobile phone data \u2013 guilty or innocent. But let\u2019s give Twitter the benefit of the doubt for a moment. Maybe the algorithm locking accounts is doing its best to target real violators, and is, in a very small number of cases, simply failing to recognise when an account is genuine?\u2026\n\nHmmm. Been there before. Locked accounts first hit the news in 2015, when Tech Crunch reported on an explosion in the phenomenon. At the time, Twitter claimed the problem was a bug, which they were fixing. Sounds fair enough. In instances where there\u2019s a technical oversight, and genuine users are getting caught up in a trap designed to target bots, one would expect the algorithm to be improved, reducing the incidence of complaints. We should have seen a fairly rapid and then more steady reduction in account locking complaints over the two and a half year interim.\n\nBut between 2015 and 2017, the number of tweets from real people, complaining about being locked out of Twitter for apparent use of automation, unusual/suspicous activity, etc, did not diminish. It noticeably increased. What does this suggest? Well, a cynic might say it suggests that far from being keen to correct a \u2018flawed\u2019 system, Twitter has in fact re-engineered the trap to catch more genuine users. To hold more real users to ransom.\n\nWHAT IS TWITTER ACTUALLY DOING HERE?\n\nIn denying real users access to their accounts, Twitter is effectively seizing those users\u2019 content. Content which Twitter\u2019s own Terms of Service state the site does not own\u2026\n\n\u201cYou retain your rights to any Content you submit, post or display on or through the Services. What\u2019s yours is yours \u2014 you own your Content (and your photos and videos are part of the Content).\u201d\n\nEr, not if Twitter has seized control of that content, I don\u2019t. If I can\u2019t access my account to remove content from the Internet, Twitter has taken ownership of that content. Another line in the ToS states\u2026\n\n\u201cTwitter respects the intellectual property rights of others\u201d\n\nSeizing control of those property rights is not what I\u2019d call respect.\n\nIS A PHONE NUMBER THE BEST WAY TO VERIFY THAT A USER IS NOT USING AUTOMATION?\n\nObviously not. ALL automation is implemented by humans. A human can thus enter a phone number into a website, verify that phone number, and still proceed to run a fully-automated Twitter account.\n\nThis is not the case with something like Google\u2019s image-based Captcha. A multi-stage Captcha check, served at a point where use of automation is suspected, is an incredibly reliable way to incapacitate bots. If you really want to stop bots from using your website, a sophisticated Captcha is the way to do it.\n\nExcept, of course, Twitter doesn\u2019t want to stop bots from using its website. It SUPPORTS the use of automated processes. Let\u2019s look, in summary, at what Twitter is actually saying. Words are mine; sentiments are Twitter\u2019s\u2026\n\n\u201cWe condone the use of automation. We use automation ourselves. We authorise apps that enable automation. But we locked you out of your account because we think you MIGHT have used automation. Despite the fact that a multi-step Captcha process is the best and most obvious way to incapacitate automation, we instead demand your phone number (which actually WON\u2019T stop you using automation) as a means of solving this problem\u2026 A problem which may not exist, because we\u2019re not sure you ARE using automation, and which isn\u2019t a problem anyway, because we support and authorise the use of automation.\n\nBy the way, until you pay our ransom of a mobile phone number, we have seized control of your content, which we do not own, and have no right to seize. We have also automatically unfollowed the accounts you took the time to follow, creating the impression that YOU deliberately unfollowed them, and alienating you in the process. Oh, and wasting a lot of your time. Have a nice day.\u201d\n\nIn Twitter\u2019s blog post about safety on 17th March 2020, it lies about privacy, that it is \u201cBuilding systems that enable our team to continue to enforce our rules remotely around the world. We\u2019re also increasing our employee assistance and wellness support for everyone involved in this critical work, and ensuring people\u2019s privacy and security stay a top priority\u201d.\n\nRecently, research posted by the Wall Street Journal showed that Twitter\u2019s attempt at cleaning up after it emerged that bots control trending topics stalled.\n\nThe solution to these, if you love your privacy is, unfortunately, to stop using Twitter.", "articleBodyHtml": "<article>\n\n<figure><img src=\"https://i0.wp.com/www.cnyakundi.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/jack.jpg?resize=880%2C609&amp;ssl=1\" alt=\"\" srcset=\"https://i0.wp.com/www.cnyakundi.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/jack.jpg?w=1024&amp;ssl=1 1024w, https://i0.wp.com/www.cnyakundi.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/jack.jpg?resize=300%2C208&amp;ssl=1 300w, https://i0.wp.com/www.cnyakundi.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/jack.jpg?resize=768%2C532&amp;ssl=1 768w, https://i0.wp.com/www.cnyakundi.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/jack.jpg?resize=960%2C665&amp;ssl=1 960w, https://i0.wp.com/www.cnyakundi.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/jack.jpg?resize=578%2C400&amp;ssl=1 578w, https://i0.wp.com/www.cnyakundi.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/jack.jpg?resize=585%2C405&amp;ssl=1 585w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 880px) 100vw, 880px\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\"><figcaption><p>Twitter CEO and co-founder Jack Dorsey gestures while interacting with students at the Indian Institute of Technology (IIT) in New Delhi on November 12, 2018. \u2013 Dorsey hosted a town hall meeting with university students on his visit to the Indian capital New Delhi.

Been there before. Locked accounts first hit the news in 2015, when <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2015/02/10/twitter-account-locked/\">Tech Crunch reported on an explosion in the phenomenon</a>. At the time, Twitter claimed the problem was a bug, which they were fixing. Sounds fair enough. In instances where there\u2019s a technical oversight, and genuine users are getting caught up in a trap designed to target bots, one would expect the algorithm to be improved, reducing the incidence of complaints. We should have seen a fairly rapid and then more steady reduction in account locking complaints over the two and a half year interim.</strong></p>\n\n<p><strong>But between 2015 and 2017, the number of tweets from real people, complaining about being locked out of Twitter for apparent use of automation, unusual/suspicous activity, etc, did not diminish. It noticeably increased. What does this suggest? Well, a cynic might say it suggests that far from being keen to correct a \u2018flawed\u2019 system, Twitter has in fact re-engineered the trap to catch <em>more</em> genuine users. To hold <em>more</em> real users to ransom.</strong></p>\n\n<p><strong>WHAT IS TWITTER ACTUALLY DOING HERE?</strong></p>\n\n<p><strong>In denying real users access to their accounts, Twitter is effectively seizing those users\u2019 content. Content which <a href=\"https://twitter.com/tos\">Twitter\u2019s own Terms of Service</a> state the site does not own\u2026</strong></p>\n\n<p><strong>\u201cYou retain your rights to any Content you submit, post or display on or through the Services. What\u2019s yours is yours \u2014 you own your Content (and your photos and videos are part of the Content).\u201d</strong></p>\n\n<p><strong>Er, not if Twitter has seized control of that content, I don\u2019t. If I can\u2019t access my account to remove content from the Internet, Twitter has taken ownership of that content. Another line in the ToS states\u2026</strong></p>\n\n<p><strong>\u201cTwitter respects the intellectual property rights of others\u201d</strong></p>\n\n<p><strong>Seizing control of those property rights is not what I\u2019d call respect.</strong></p>\n\n<h2><strong>IS A PHONE NUMBER THE BEST WAY TO VERIFY THAT A USER IS NOT USING AUTOMATION?</strong></h2>\n\n<p><strong>Obviously not. ALL automation is implemented by humans. A human can thus enter a phone number into a website, verify that phone number, and still proceed to run a fully-automated Twitter account.</strong></p>\n\n<p><strong>This is not the case with something like Google\u2019s image-based Captcha. A multi-stage Captcha check, served at a point where use of automation is suspected, is an incredibly reliable way to incapacitate bots. If you really want to stop bots from using your website, a sophisticated Captcha is the way to do it.</strong></p>\n\n<p><strong>Except, of course, Twitter <em>doesn\u2019t</em> want to stop bots from using its website. It SUPPORTS the use of automated processes. Let\u2019s look, in summary, at what Twitter is actually saying. Words are mine; sentiments are Twitter\u2019s\u2026</strong></p>\n\n<p><strong><em>\u201cWe condone the use of automation. We use automation ourselves. We authorise apps that enable automation. But we locked you out of your account because we think you MIGHT have used automation. Despite the fact that a multi-step Captcha process is the best and most obvious way to incapacitate automation, we instead demand your phone number (which actually WON\u2019T stop you using automation) as a means of solving this problem\u2026 A problem which may not exist, because we\u2019re not sure you ARE using automation, and which isn\u2019t a problem anyway, because we support and authorise the use of automation. </em></strong></p>\n\n<p><strong><em>By the way, until you pay our ransom of a mobile phone number, we have seized control of your content, which we do not own, and have no right to seize. We have also automatically unfollowed the accounts you took the time to follow, creating the impression that YOU deliberately unfollowed them, and alienating you in the process. Oh, and wasting a lot of your time. Have a nice day.\u201d</em></strong></p>\n\n<p>In Twitter\u2019s blog post about safety on 17th March 2020, it lies about privacy, that it is \u201cBuilding systems that enable our team to continue to enforce our rules remotely around the world.

Big move by @jack, and a bigger contrast to @Facebook 's increasingly problematic policy positions. https://t.co/nm9rckaKHc\n\n\u2014 Edward Snowden (@Snowden) October 30, 2019\n\nHere are his tweets in full text:\n\nWe\u2019ve made the decision to stop all political advertising on Twitter globally. We believe political message reach should be earned, not bought. Why? A few reasons\u2026?\n\nA political message earns reach when people decide to follow an account or retweet. Paying for reach removes that decision, forcing highly optimized and targeted political messages on people. We believe this decision should not be compromised by money.\n\nWhile internet advertising is incredibly powerful and very effective for commercial advertisers, that power brings significant risks to politics, where it can be used to influence votes to affect the lives of millions.\n\nInternet political ads present entirely new challenges to civic discourse: machine learning-based optimization of messaging and micro-targeting, unchecked misleading information, and deep fakes. All at increasing velocity, sophistication, and overwhelming scale.\n\nThese challenges will affect ALL internet communication, not just political ads. Best to focus our efforts on the root problems, without the additional burden and complexity taking money brings.

Paying for reach removes that decision, forcing highly optimized and targeted political messages on people. We believe this decision should not be compromised by money.</p>\n\n<p>While internet advertising is incredibly powerful and very effective for commercial advertisers, that power brings significant risks to politics, where it can be used to influence votes to affect the lives of millions.</p>\n\n<p>Internet political ads present entirely new challenges to civic discourse: machine learning-based optimization of messaging and micro-targeting, unchecked misleading information, and deep fakes. All at increasing velocity, sophistication, and overwhelming scale.</p>\n\n<p>These challenges will affect ALL internet communication, not just political ads. Best to focus our efforts on the root problems, without the additional burden and complexity taking money brings.

Mr. Kombo himself in a highly charged Special General Meeting in 2019 assured parents that he would exit the school by end of year 2020 but later and due to the COVID-19 pandemic, he was illegally offered one (1) year extension to cover for the lost time.\n\nThat aside, Parents of Nyali School who are now used to corrupt practices in the school never imagined that corruption would lead to the school robbing their young kids their fun just for someone to get a share of the cut from the trip fund.\n\nFor Many years, these school trips have been well organized to create a perception of \u201cacademic nature\u201d but at the same time be sources of money for people whose main interest is to fleece the school and enrich themselves. The head teacher (John Kombo \u2013 one of the richest headteacher in the region) loved the trips so much that each term they couldn\u2019t miss three or four. However, with COVID-19 hitting the country, all the trips came to a halt and shutting off the source of the money for some people. With the Country now opening up, Mr. Kombo has decided to start his money extracting sources with a bang. Already, almost each stream is scheduled to go for a trip before end of the year or probably before end of his term at Nyali School.\n\nThe Class PP 2 were organized to go for an academic trip that was scheduled to visit the Arabuko forest initially and Pride Inn Hotel for fun (lunch and swimming) before coming back to the school. Parents were charged Ksh. 2500 per kid this despite the school providing its own transport and its own drivers. The trip was only to cater for \u201cfuel\u201d, snacks and lunch.

It is said in the school that if you wish Mr. Kombo to mess with you, you are only required to mess with Ms. Cecilia. The lady is feared even by senior upper primary school teachers.\n\nMs. Cecilia masterminded everything while working closely with Mr. Kombo whom they ensured maximum extract shall be obtained from the trip. In any way, they were assured parents of Nyali would not know the details of how smart they were in getting their cut from the trip.\n\nThe excited innocent kids left the school on Friday 12 th November, 2021 at 0730 hours in what was to be an exciting day. However, they Immediately headed to Naivas Supermarket at Nyali to \u201cget snacks and water\u201d. The kids were however left to wait in their buses at Naivas for almost three hours for Naivas to open and get snacks for 100 Kids. Many parents wonder why the snacks were not bought the previous day. The kids left Naivas at 11am and instead of being taken to Arabuko Forest as planned, they were taken to a private farm in Kilifi County belonging a parent wherein they were only shown poultry farm and few animals. The farm was very far in the interior of Kilifi County and by the time they reached there, it was already in the afternoon. The hungry Kids were later driven back to Mombasa and taken to Voyager Hotel (a cheaper Hotel than Pride Inn). The kids were supposed to have been given half board lunch comprising of a buffet but were instead offered half plate chips, a hot dog and a drink.\n\nThe Kids got a bigger shock when they were ordered to just get into the pool for only 15 \u2013 20 Minutes in what many believe was to fool parents that the kids enjoyed swimming.\n\nAlmost all the young innocent kids came back home hungry and angry. Hungry for not have eaten food for the most part of the day and angry for not having had the fun they expected. This made many parents of PP2 protest against Mr. Kombo who immediately shifted the blame to the Kindergarten Teachers. On Monday 15 th November 2021, a section of parents confronted Mr. Kombo in his office demanding explanation and Stop to these money fleecing trips. Many openly told Mr. Kombo to peacefully exit the school and go run his Paramount Educational Centre. The Parents have since remained in Shock on how their kids could be subjected to humiliating conditions just for someone to get a cut out of the trip.\n\nTo make matters worst, the board of management and specifically the Education Committee has kept mute on the matter and gave Mr. Kombo a platform to play PR with parents. It is still unknown if the Education committee of the board was aware of the trip. Whatever the case, the Education committee has never been involved in any of the school academic issues. They only exist for display, Mr. Kombo runs the show Already, a circular has been released by the school giving an apology and confirming that the kids would be taken back to pride Inn and enjoy their swimming. In the letter, the school confirmed the trip was a failure but attributed some last minute changes to the abrupt changes of the initial plan. Many parents have welcomed the apology but wonder why wasn\u2019t the trip postponed to cater for the changes and who will pay for this repeat exercise. Why wont those who messed with the trip bare the cost of the repeat exercise?\n\nTruth be said, parents of Nyali school, Teachers and subordinate staff are tired of Mr. Kombo.

Many don\u2019t believe that his contract would be renewed that\u2019s why they are seeing Mr. Kombo scrambling to get his last rob from Nyali school. Many are disappointed with the way the secretary of the board has failed to guide the board professionally despite being a senior counsel in town. Parents are even contemplating writing to LSK to complain on his professional conduct and his aiding of unethical and corrupt practices in the school.

Aluta Continua!,\u201d he Tweeted\n\nIf the bots or shadowy persons behind the reporting of Miguna Twitter accounts continue the onslaught, he will sure lose his account.\n\nCensorship\n\nCensorship of free speech has been on the increase over the past 5 years and with the rise of Donald Trump, the world was treated to the absurd.\n\nThose that spoke the reality underlying all existence and rationality, found themselves grappling with lack of audience; because either they had been deplatformed (deleted) or their accounts shadow banned.\n\nShadowbanning is worse, a person won\u2019t know that their message isn\u2019t reaching the targeted audience because in shadowbanning, your message isn\u2019t deleted, but the systems make sure no one sees it through algorithmic manipulation.\n\nFact checkers, who are they?\n\nThere\u2019s a saying, \u2018fact checkers didn\u2019t exist until the truth started coming out\u2019.\n\nNo other person in Kenya has suffered the wrath of the so called fact checkers than blogger Cyprian Nyakundi.\n\nBlogger Cyprian Nyakundi is the most deplatformed in the whole of Africa.\n\nNyakundi lost his powerful Twitter account in 2018, his YouTube was also deleted together with his Facebook account with over 330k followers and just as many likes.\n\nWho fact checks the fact checkers? What are the facts?\n\nThere\u2019s another saying that, \u2018whoever controls information, controls the media\u2019. And from this, I\u2019ll give an example.\n\nSo, the media for example would support the lame agenda of homosexuality, which goes against the natural order of being. Then, this special interests will buy (use a lot of money) space in all the media houses, confuse children with stupid education, traumatize some others with inuendos through what they call entertainment. Then when time has passed and the lie has been repeated till it appears like the truth, they call it fact.\n\nSo, you, a fully grown human being with rational thoughts, you come across this malaise being peddled somewhere and go on the offensive; defending the right position of nature.\n\nThe fact checkers will pounce on your posts, filter them, shadow ban you or even delete your account.\n\nSee, what we in the modern world call facts? Laughable.\n\nIf it is a fact, why fear the opposite of it?\n\nThe argument against bullying is in fact a creation of another diabolic state of being; a feminised society.\n\nA feminised society is one where emotions rule decisions. No rational thought is given audience.
