the article concerns the nomination of candidates and not their election,\u201d he stated.\n\nThe activist who filed the suit at the Milimani Law courts on Monday further indicated that under the

issued that any public officer must vacate office before nomination as a presidential candidate,\u201d Omtata said.\n\nHe also asked the Court to give a declaration that a sitting president, a sitting deputy president, a sitting governor, and a sitting deputy governor cannot be elected to elective positions other than the ones they currently hold.\n\nThe Human Rights activist wants the Court to issue an order quashing Section 43(5), (5A) and (6) of the Elections Act, 2012 because it does not state the reasons for limiting the ability of public officers to vie for political office.\n\nHe

promise made, a promise kept\n\nOn the morning of the first working day of the New Year, Chinese State Councilor and Foreign Minister Wang Yi embarked on his first trip abroad in 2022, to Africa of course, as always. It has been an unbroken tradition for 32 years, rain or shine, Ebola or Omicron. This is his second journey to Africa in a little over a month. In late November, State Councilor Wang visited the continent for the eighth Ministerial Conference of the Forum on China-Africa Cooperation (FOCAC). In his keynote address at the opening ceremony of the conference, Chinese President Xi Jinping reaffirmed the spirit of China-Africa friendship and cooperation (i.e. sincere friendship and equality, win-win for mutual benefit and common development, fairness and justice, and progress with the times and openness and inclusiveness), proposed nine programs (i.e. medical and health program, poverty reduction and agricultural development program, trade promotion program, investment promotion program, digital innovation program, green development program, capacity building program, cultural and people-to-people exchange program, and peace and security program), and put forth the building of a China-Africa community with a shared future in the new era. This New Year trip is to follow up and deliver. It is a testament to time-honored, profound friendship between China and Africa, an engagement for deeper cooperation of mutual benefit, and a commitment to peace, progress and prosperity of the developing world.\n\nA friend in need\n\nBraving the shock of Omicron, State Councilor Wang traveled to Eritrea, Kenya and the Comoros. Health is high on the agenda, and rightly so. African countries have been hit hard by the virus. The need for vaccines is apparent. The World Health Organization put forward the goal of achieving full vaccination rates of 40% in every country by the end of December 2021, a target missed across most of Africa. Challenging times reveal true friendship. President Xi announced at the FOCAC meeting another one billion doses of vaccines to Africa to help make vaccines more accessible and affordable and bridge the immunization gap. China will provide another 10 million doses to Kenya and as many vaccines as the Comoros requires to realize vaccination for all within this year. And not just that. In Chinese philosophy, you give others fish and also teach them how to fish. There will be joint production of vaccines, development of cold-chain facilities and medical and health programs to build greater capacity of preparedness and response to the current pandemic and potential outbreaks. Such gestures attest to China\u2019s strong resolve to stand firmly with Africa until the virus is ultimately defeated.\n\nThis visit to the horn of Africa happens in the context of much reported flareups in the region. The situation in Ethiopia, Somalia and Sudan has been news headlines for quite some time, albeit for distressing reasons. A genuine friend is always ready to oblige. State Councilor Wang proposed an outlook on peace and development in the horn of Africa, tossing out the idea of a peace conference and offering to appoint a Chinese special envoy to facilitate the process. Put it in a nutshell, China kindly suggests addressing both the symptoms concerning security and the root causes related to development and governance. It\u2019s as important to accelerate economic growth as to resolve ethnic and religious discord. It\u2019s as important to keep the region\u2019s destiny in its own hands as to pursue development and achieve stability, Africa-led and Africa-owned. Non-interference in internal affairs, a principle enshrined in the Charter of the United Nations, remains as true today as ever before, if not more.\n\nA partner in deed\n\nAs peace and security is a prerequisite for development and progress, growth and prosperity in turn reinforces stability and harmony. At the new Kipevu Oil Terminall (KOT), the largest of its kind in Africa, built by a Chinese company, State Councilor Wang rekindled the memory of historical bonds, the three visits by the Chinese navigator Zheng He to Mombasa over 600 years ago, when he presented to the local communities nothing but goodwill and tea. He commended the Chinese engineers as following the illustrious footsteps of Zheng and contributing to the best railway (the Standard Gauge Railway from Nairobi to Mombasa) and the best oil terminal in Kenya. Both are signature harvests in high-quality, people-centered Belt and Road cooperation between China and Africa.\n\nStanding side by side, Kenyan President Uhuru Kenyatta said that the new offshore jetty, replacing the 50-year old onshore KOT, will reduce not only the cost of fuel but also to ensure that Kenya and the region will be able to consistently have an adequate supply of fuel for development needs of the people. \u201cOur partnership with China is not a partnership based on China telling us what to do. It is a partnership of friends, working together to meet Kenya\u2019s socio-economic agenda.\u201d \u201cI can clearly say Kenya would not have been able to achieve many of our social-economic development agendas without the support of China. And this is something that not only we as a government appreciate but also the people of Kenya appreciate,\u201d the President said. Powerful words, noble deeds.\n\nAdvertisement.

Yet China-Africa partnership is much more than that. Trade, investment, digital innovation, green growth, cultural ties, opportunities abound. With an impressive track record and a firm dedication to solidarity and partnership, China and Africa, comrades-in-arms, will make new, big strides on the path to modernization.

What is critical is to listen to the tone and mood of the messages coming online. Analyzing these messages from disgruntled customers will help you respond with empathy, meaning you understand their issues and show concern on how to deal with them swiftly and rationally. A brand should always be remorseful of its action through an apologetic demeanor. Big boy syndrome demeanor and rude response can erode your brand value quickly and put you out of business, allowing your competition to acquire your sad customers.\nBrand Communication: The communication should be simple, articulate, and actionable. KFC should have just told its customers that it was experiencing a shortage, and in the due cause, it was going to sort out the issue and reassure its customers of its values and service to the customer as a brand. The response from the CEO was perceived as an attack on its area of operation and to its customers.\nMessaging and Tonality: A brand should ensure that its message during a crisis is positive and palatable to the already disgruntled customers. The message should also be sensitive to the demographics online, especially when communicating to Millennials and Generation Z, the biggest consumers of KFC products.\nBe fast, rational, and authentic: Responding fast to a crisis online is essential. But, it is necessary to be sensible and genuine in your response. However, be cautious in responding faster if you have nothing of substance to say to your consumers. It is crucial for the communication, marketing, and executive department to come together and ensure that whatever response is crafted in the customer\u2019s interest and does not upset the rest of the stakeholders.\nReward and Loyalty\n\nAs I conclude, Business Mogul and Billionaire Warren Buffet once said,\u201d \u201cIt takes 20 years to build a reputation and five minutes to ruin it.

Every man can see it in his own compound. We come together because it is good for kinsmen to do so.\u201d\n\nWhen political leaders attend each other\u2019s national functions, like we have seen in the recent past, they succeed whether by design or default, to remind the voters that they are all first among equals and it is for Kenyans to make the last call of who to give power. Today, critics have lamented the push by President Kenyatta to push leaders towards a certain direction. Whether true or not, there seems to be some concerted effort to bring leaders together which for all intent and purposes is good for Kenya. It is not for President Uhuru Kenyatta to prescribe for Kenyans who to elect as his successor, but as a Kenyan who occupies a fairly privileged position to see what is good for Kenyans, he has a right to play his part.\n\nWhat is clear is that the President is not going to tell us who to elect as his successor, that is if he has not done so, but he certainly has done what I would say is great for Kenya. Through the handshake and his rallying call to unite Kenyans, he has made the level playing field even and fair for all aspirants seeking to succeed him. I doubt he is giving anyone a head start, but he is certainly making it easy for Kenyans to have their way. Word is out there that efforts have been made to bring like-minded political kingpins together in some sort of unity of purpose and churn the best way forward, but it does seem that three OKA principals have deemed it fit to marvel at the moon from their own compounds. If the moonlight village ground meetings are good for Kenya, then these three principals are poised for a back clash from their kinsmen and Kenyans at large.\n\nIt is at the village ground that statesmanship is demonstrated and elders get to see who among the village elders is fit to lead. In effect, the conspicuous absence of the three who, also missed the People\u2019s President swearing-in in January 2018 technically suggests that the game is now on and the two-horse race is turning into reality.\n\nWell, I\u2019ve been in this space for some time and a lot of critics lament the two-horse race narrative asserting that it bundles all Kenyans into a narrow array of two choices. Granted, democracy is better served when there is a plurality of choices and the media provides a platform that allows a wider array of political players to reach the mass public with their agenda. But it is also instructive to note that the public domain should be a preserve of substantive public interest discourse and not the parochial interest of self-seekers whose space in the public sphere may not necessarily provide substantive choices.\n\nOKA principals might be substantive, but dilly-dallying on giving us a third choice that is substantive or backing the two major front runners puts them at risk of losing their political clout. In fact, Senator Gideon Moi proved that leadership is about substance and worthy competition. As a presidential candidate himself endorsed by Kanu, he has elevated himself to this privileged position that will put him in good stead going forward.\n\nWhatever happens going forward, especially if he rallies behind Raila Odinga, Gideon has endeared himself not just to Raila Odinga\u2019s inner circle of power, but also his loyal supporters. Remember the loyalty of Raila\u2019s supporters is unwavering. But then his three OKA colleagues should be reminded of the rise and rise of Hon Adan Duale, who in the run-up to the 2013 general elections took a decisive step at a time when leaders from the North Eastern region and the significant Somali voting block were dilly-dallying. He emerged, was decisive and today he has the distinction of having served as the first Majority Leader of Kenya and is by no means a powerhouse who the Deputy President cannot afford to do without.\n\nBut before I digress let me get back to track. The failure by OKA to show us the third formidable way and Raila Odinga\u2019s grand show of force and support by folks who have won President Kibaki and President Uhuru Kenyatta elections raises very pertinent aspects of the two-horse race. That now more than ever before we need to keenly listen to both the Deputy Presidents and Baba and ask them hard questions about what their presidencies portend, and perhaps start thinking of the reality of a Raila Odinga presidency.\n\nAdvertisement. Scroll to continue reading.\n\nThe consistency as a social Democrat, which is now turning to a reality of Ksh 6000 social welfare to address the plight of the power, the fight for the common mwanaichi and now the confluence of all these into Azimio la Umoja speak of both new dawn and a continuation of what President Uhuru Kenyatta has done in the last five years.\n\nIt doesn\u2019t matter whether we see president Uhuru Kenyatta\u2019s hand in Baba\u2019s candidature or not, a Baba presidency seems to be coming at an opportune moment when Uhuru\u2019s legacy of solid infrastructural development needs a safe and sober kind of leadership. Whether Baba offers that is for Kenyans to decide, but obviously, we are moving to this space where track record, past leadership credentials and temperament will come to bear. Whereas Baba had moments with President Moi, he worked with Moi in the interest of Kenyans, buried the hatchet and moved on.\n\nHe worked with President Kibaki, fell out, but found it within himself to work with Kibaki in the grand coalition that began the journey of transformation. At no point has he hit back or even disparaged president Moi or Kibaki. His relationship with President Uhuru Kenyatta is fresh in Kenyans minds and to get into the handshake for the sake of Kenyans at the expense of a few loyalists that he probably lost in the process, speak of selflessness to many, but also a betrayal to some.\n\nIn fact, if there is any doubt about the Uhuru and Baba commitment to a Kenya of shared prosperity then one needs to go back to president Uhuru\u2019s reaching out to Baba in March 2018 to allay those doubts. The president did not have to do it, he had won an election and had been sworn in as a legitimate president for five years.\n\nHis reaching out to Baba speaks of his genuine desire to deliver on his promises in the last term and from my political communication mind, lay a foundation for a legacy that would change the paradigm of Kenyan politics. Politics of ethnic and regional balkanization is already a thing of the past and we are witnessing an electioneering period where leaders can traverse the entire country and sell their agenda without any fear of political intolerance.\n\nSuffice to say, President Uhuru might not say much about who succeeds him, but he has already done enough to ensure that whoever succeeds him is the choice of Kenyans. It does seem that we will be looking at the next presidential elections against the backdrop of bottom-up approach and Azimio la Umoja. One is trying to buy Kenyans into running away from what the Jubilee government has done in the last few years while the other is bringing Kenyans together as we build on the gains we have made as a country in the last few years.", "articleBodyHtml": "<article>\n\n<p>The current political situation has some echoes of Chinua Achebe\u2019s most cited quote, \u201cwhen we gather together in the moonlight village ground, it is not because of the moon.

Scroll to continue reading.</p>\n\n<p>The consistency as a social Democrat, which is now turning to a reality of Ksh 6000 social welfare to address the plight of the power, the fight for the common <em>mwanaichi</em> and now the confluence of all these into Azimio la Umoja speak of both new dawn and a continuation of what President Uhuru Kenyatta has done in the last five years.</p>\n\n<p>It doesn\u2019t matter whether we see president Uhuru Kenyatta\u2019s hand in Baba\u2019s candidature or not, a Baba presidency seems to be coming at an opportune moment when Uhuru\u2019s legacy of solid infrastructural development needs a safe and sober kind of leadership. Whether Baba offers that is for Kenyans to decide, but obviously, we are moving to this space where track record, past leadership credentials and temperament will come to bear. Whereas Baba had moments with President Moi, he worked with Moi in the interest of Kenyans, buried the hatchet and moved on.</p>\n\n<p>He worked with President Kibaki, fell out, but found it within himself to work with Kibaki in the grand coalition that began the journey of transformation. At no point has he hit back or even disparaged president Moi or Kibaki. His relationship with President Uhuru Kenyatta is fresh in Kenyans minds and to get into the handshake for the sake of Kenyans at the expense of a few loyalists that he probably lost in the process, speak of selflessness to many, but also a betrayal to some.</p>\n\n<p>In fact, if there is any doubt about the Uhuru and Baba commitment to a Kenya of shared prosperity then one needs to go back to president Uhuru\u2019s reaching out to Baba in March 2018 to allay those doubts. The president did not have to do it, he had won an election and had been sworn in as a legitimate president for five years.</p>\n\n<p>His reaching out to Baba speaks of his genuine desire to deliver on his promises in the last term and from my political communication mind, lay a foundation for a legacy that would change the paradigm of Kenyan politics. Politics of ethnic and regional balkanization is already a thing of the past and we are witnessing an electioneering period where leaders can traverse the entire country and sell their agenda without any fear of political intolerance.</p>\n\n<p>Suffice to say, President Uhuru might not say much about who succeeds him, but he has already done enough to ensure that whoever succeeds him is the choice of Kenyans. It does seem that we will be looking at the next presidential elections against the backdrop of bottom-up approach and Azimio la Umoja. One is trying to buy Kenyans into running away from what the Jubilee government has done in the last few years while the other is bringing Kenyans together as we build on the gains we have made as a country in the last few years.</p>\n\n</article>", "canonicalUrl": "https://www.capitalfm.co.ke/news/2021/12/hesbon-owila-the-two-horse-race-factor-in-2022-elections/"},{"url": "https://www.capitalfm.co.ke/news/2022/01/chinese-foreign-ministers-east-african-visit-underscores-regions-importance/", "probability": 0.9729382, "headline": "Chinese foreign minister\u2019s East African visit underscores region\u2019s importance", "datePublished": "2022-01-06T00:00:00", "datePublishedRaw": "2022-01-06", "dateModified": "2022-01-06T00:00:00", "dateModifiedRaw": "2022-01-06", "author": "CGTN", "authorsList": ["CGTN"], "inLanguage": "en", "mainImage": "https://www.capitalfm.co.ke/news/files/2022/01/kenyachina-1.jpeg", "images": ["https://news.cgtn.com/news/2022-01-06/Chinese-foreign-minister-s-East-African-trip-shows-region-s-importance-16ARspKZSjS/img/dbd9261782b745b08961c0ab030bb110/dbd9261782b745b08961c0ab030bb110.jpeg", "https://www.capitalfm.co.ke/news/files/2022/01/kenyachina-1.jpeg"], "description": "In early January 1991, Qian Qichen, at that time the foreign minister of China, paid an official visit to Ethiopia, Uganda, Kenya, and Tanzania.

Every year since then, Africa has been the first overseas destination of a Chinese foreign minister in a new year. Upholding that tradition, Wang Yi, state councilor and current foreign minister of China, is presently on a three-nation trip to East Africa. His January 4-7 trip to Eritrea, Kenya, and the Comoros comes just over a month after the conclusion of the Eighth Ministerial Conference of the Forum on China-Africa Cooperation (FOCAC) in Dakar, Senegal.\n\nZhao Lijian, a spokesperson for China\u2019s foreign ministry, announced that the foreign minister aims to promote the implementation of the outcomes of the FOCAC Ministerial Conference, dovetail new measures for practical cooperation between China and Africa, and support African countries in defeating COVID-19 and promoting economic recovery.\n\nWang\u2019s first overseas visit of the year \u2013 coming so soon after the FOCAC summit last November \u2013 underscores the great importance that China attaches to its partnerships with African countries and also helps to highlight the strong ties that have developed between Beijing and the continent over the years. Although Sino-Africa relations have a long history that can be traced back centuries, in recent decades China and many African countries have noticeably grown much closer. Sino-African cooperation extends to a variety of issues and a wide range of fields, while economically, China has emerged as Africa\u2019s most important partner. It is the continent\u2019s largest bilateral trading partner, the biggest bilateral lender, and among the leading sources of assistance and foreign direct investment.\n\nOn the first leg of his trip, Wang arrived in Asmara, the Eritrean capital on the evening of January 4, where he was warmly received at the airport by Osman Saleh, Eritrea\u2019s foreign minister, and a delegation of senior officials. During his two-day visit, Wang met his counterpart and President Isaias Afwerki.\n\nIn talks covering a range of domestic, regional, and global issues of mutual concern, Afwerki applauded China\u2019s progress and contributions to a global order based on respect for international law, while the Chinese foreign minister expressed gratitude for Eritrea\u2019s adherence to the one-China principle and China\u2019s rejection of unilateral sanctions. Notably, it was announced that China would extend 100 million yuan ($15.7 million) in support of Eritrea and that there would be more cooperation on human capacity building, infrastructure, mining, and developments at the ports in Assab and Massawa on the Red Sea. Prior to Wang\u2019s departure from Eritrea, he also signed a joint statement alongside the Eritrean foreign minister.\n\nThese developments reflect the strengthening of the China-Eritrea bilateral relationship. In late November 2021, Eritrea became the latest African country to ink a memorandum of understanding to join the Belt and Road Initiative (BRI), a transcontinental infrastructure and development project announced by Chinese President Xi Jinping in 2013.\n\nFor China, Eritrea represents a reliable partner, boasts tremendous untapped potential and important ports, and offers excellent positioning near critical transit routes for global trade. The Bab el-Mandeb Strait forms a vital link in the maritime route between the Mediterranean Sea and the Indian Ocean via the Red Sea and the Suez Canal. Due to its strategic location, Eritrea also offers considerable potential as a regional hub for markets in neighboring Ethiopia, South Sudan and Sudan \u2013 countries where China has invested heavily and maintains significant economic interests. Notably, the recent MoU with Eritrea and possible further investments moving forward also provide Beijing with an opportunity to signal its continued willingness to back some infrastructure development in Africa at a time when questions have been raised about a possible reduction in aid to the continent.\n\nAdvertisement. Scroll to continue reading.\n\nMeanwhile, for Eritrea, active participation in the BRI can help to boost socio-economic growth and encourage general development, particularly through stimulating greater levels of trade and investment. BRI participation will also play a role in improving the country\u2019s industrialization and increasing its connectivity to the rest of the world. Previously, Eritrea\u2019s Foreign Minister Osman has also encouraged China\u2019s cooperation on investments that enhance local value-addition and secondary or tertiary levels of manufacturing.\n\nFrom Eritrea, Wang headed to Kenya, where he was due to hold talks with Kenyan President Uhuru Kenyatta and Raychelle Omamo, the cabinet secretary for foreign affairs.\n\nKenya, the largest economy in East Africa and a historic hub of Indian Ocean trade, is a longstanding key partner for China. It has been a BRI nation since 2014 and China has supported the development of a number of significant infrastructure projects in the country, including the Mombasa-Nairobi Standard Gauge Railway, the Lamu port, the Lake Turkana power project, and the Nairobi Expressway. There has also been a steady rise in the number of Chinese companies investing in Kenya over the years, and in 2021, a total of 107 companies were operating in the country.\n\nWithin this context, the Chinese foreign minister\u2019s trip to Kenya is expected to further cement relations between the two countries, as well as to offer fresh impetus and renewed support in the face of some challenges that have arisen related to projects in the country. Notably, during a recent inspection tour of the Nairobi Expressway, President Kenyatta expressed his appreciation toward China, explaining, \u201cOur partnership with China is one that is mutually beneficial, that is based on win-win and we are very grateful to the Chinese government and the Chinese people for the support they continue to render not only to our country but to the rest of Africa.\u201d\n\nTo round off his trip to Africa, Wang will head to the Comoros, a small archipelago in the Indian Ocean. China was the first country to recognize and establish formal diplomatic ties with the island nation after the former French colony declared its independence in 1975. Since then, they have maintained a positive bilateral relationship. Accordingly, Wang\u2019s visit, which is the first in some time by a Chinese foreign minister to the Comoros, will provide a useful opportunity for the two countries to engage on issues of mutual concern, further strengthen their longstanding ties, and establish more areas for effective cooperation.", "articleBodyHtml": "<article>\n\n<p>In early January 1991, Qian Qichen, at that time the foreign minister of China, paid an official visit to Ethiopia, Uganda, Kenya, and Tanzania.

Their source of income.\n\nBut Wambui believes she is better off because at 23, she only had one child as compared to her friends. Some like their leader Anastacia Wangechi is looking after 6 children, including one left to her brother.\n\nShe said the sixth \u2018dumped\u2019 at her house by a friend who fled the area.\n\nTheirs, they say, is not a question of morals, but survival, and they are willing to push any limit to feed themselves and their dependants.\n\nWelcome to Grogan area in Korogocho slum, a poverty-stricken section of the expansive informal settlement, running across the filthy Nairobi river-that serves as an alternative source of food, when all other taps get dry.\n\n\u201cDo we sit down and die of hunger?\u201d it is a question each of the 25 ladies posed, with a tone of defiance and contentment.\n\nThey know no other life.\n\n\u201cWhere are my slippers?\u201d a drunk youthful man yelled in the middle of this interview, on waking up from what they refer to as the \u2018base\u2019.\n\nIt is a single room with a bed and a worn-out seat. Clothes are hung across the wall, as if on display.\n\nThe man was a client to one of the ladies and had spent the night there.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t want to be filmed. I know you are going to say I am a drunkard,\u201d he said, missing a step on a staircase as he staggered out.\n\nIn Swahili slang, they call their \u2018profession\u2019 \u201cKutega\u201d, one of the sectors, they say, is worst affected by the coronavirus pandemic, coupled with the dusk to dawn curfew among other containment measures like the closure of bars.\n\nKenya has been on night curfew for four months now since April, with bars declared closed until further notice to help curb the spread of the pandemic that had infected well over 20,000 people and killed more than 300 by August 2. Public health officials have warned of tough times ahead as the country wades through the infection peak period projected to run until the end of the year.\n\nAs a result, schools and institutions of higher learning are shut and public gatherings banned.\n\nEven churches which were allowed to operate under strict social distancing gatherings are yet to open fully.\n\n\u201cAt times I wonder why I am still alive. My mother is unwell while my father is an alcoholic. My sister who also has a baby is not employed, leaving me as the only breadwinner,\u201d Wambui, who is a Form 3 drop-out, opened up to Capital FM News.\n\nRita Wanjiru, 22, required us to do a simple mathematic problem on their day to day income, which is less than two dollars \u2013 \u201cwhen we are not in the streets doing sex business.\u201d\n\nThey said the only lifeline offered by Nairobi River is that of water- which is dirty- to clean gunny bags at a cost of 50 cents each.\n\nAdvertisement. Scroll to continue reading.\n\nIn 3 days of the cleaning, one must wash at least 300 bags to earn Sh150, which amounts Sh450- total income for a good week.\n\n\u201cThis is not enough to feed our children and support our families,\u201d Wanjiru, who has a five-month-old baby said. Her firstborn was out playing.\n\nAnd with COVID-19, they say, their sex clients are equally cash strapped- and while they would charge between Sh500 and Sh1,000 within Nairobi\u2019s Central Business District- they are now taking anything.\n\n\u201cWhat do you expect me to do? Imagine it is already turning dark and I have not earned a single coin,\u201d she said.\n\nWith the sex business moved from the streets within the city to their homes, the girls have been isolated by the community.\n\n\u201cOur children too are not spared. Other children are restricted to play with them.

in film decades before the #OscarsSoWhite and Black Lives Matter movements.\n\nThe trailblazing thespian became the first male Black star nominated for an Academy Award with 1958\u2019s \u201cThe Defiant Ones\u201d and, six years later, was the first to win the best actor Oscar for his performance in \u201cLilies of the Field.\u201d\n\nCollecting his historic award, Poitier told the glamorous audience of mainly white contemporaries it had been \u201ca long journey to this moment\u201d \u2014 but his achievement would not be matched until 38 years later, when Denzel Washington won for his leading role in \u201cTraining Day.\u201d\n\nPoitier, who died Thursday night at his home in Los Angeles, achieved mainstream popularity with a series of groundbreaking roles at a time of great racial tension in America in the 1950s and 1960s.\n\nHe balanced success with a sense of duty to choose projects that tackled bigotry and stereotypes, including his 1967 classics \u201cGuess Who\u2019s Coming to Dinner\u201d and \u201cIn the Heat of the Night.\u201d\n\nPoitier was awarded an honorary Oscar in 2002 for his \u201cextraordinary performances\u201d on the silver screen and his \u201cdignity, style and intelligence\u201d off of it.\n\n\u201cI accept this award in the name of all the African American actors and actresses who went before me in the difficult years and on whose shoulders I was privileged to stand to see where I might go,\u201d Poitier said.\n\nPoitier also praised the \u201cvisionary choices of a handful of American\u201d producers, directors and studio bosses who were not afraid to stand up for the cause of equality, despite the difficulties such a stance may have caused them.\n\n\u2013 \u2018I\u2019ll always be chasing you, Sidney\u2019

Scroll to continue reading.\n\nBy coincidence, Poitier received his 2002 honorary Oscar the same night Washington won for best actor, which was also the night Halle Berry become the first \u2014 and only \u2014 African American best actress winner.\n\nIn his acceptance speech, Washington paid a heartfelt tribute to Poitier, telling him: \u201cI\u2019ll always be following in your footsteps.\u201d\n\nIn a statement to AFP following news of his death, Washington said \u201cit was a privilege to call Sidney Poitier my friend. He was a gentle man and opened doors for all of us that had been closed for years.\u201d\n\nViola Davis, herself an Oscar-winning actress, shared a similar note of admiration for Poitier\u2019s barrier-breaking life, saying his \u201cdignity, normalcy, strength, excellence and sheer electricity\u2026 showed us that we, as Black folks, mattered!!!\u201d\n\n\u2013 Discrimination \u2013\n\nBorn in the southern US state of Florida in 1927 where his tomato farmer father was selling his produce, young Sidney and his family moved back to the Bahamas, where he grew up in poverty.\n\nA dual national of the Bahamas and United States, he got his first taste of the cinema on as a youth his Caribbean island before dropping out of school at the age of 13 and returning to Miami when he was 15 to join his brother Cyril.\n\nIt was there that the impressionable young man experienced his first taste of racial discrimination, an experience that left an indelible mark on him.\n\nPoitier soon relocated to New York where he worked as a dishwasher and busboy, reportedly sleeping in bus station pay toilets as he tried to scratch out a meager existence in the tough city.\n\nDuring World War II, Poitier joined the US Army as a physiotherapist until 1945, when he returned to New York, his heart set on becoming an actor.\n\nPoitier worked to lose his Caribbean lilt and adopt an American accent, which earned him his first stage acting job as an understudy to singing star Harry Belafonte in 1945\u2019s \u201cDays of Our Youth,\u201d before making his Broadway debut in an all-Black production of \u201cLysistrata.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement.
