allowing us to assist them to acquire the assets that they need, to carry out their daily operations,\u201d she said.\n\nThe automotive market in Kenya is characterized by exceptional dynamism, which has seen car manufactures currently offer low-cost brands at attractive prices, sparking a renewed interest in new cars.\n\nFurther, the customers, buying a factory-built new car that offers them impeccable comfort, reserve the right of complete personal choice of colour of its body and the material of the seats that suits one\u2019s taste.\n\nThey also benefit from the latest technologies and
