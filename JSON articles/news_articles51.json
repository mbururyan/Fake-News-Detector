I want to partner with you so that we can bring change to our country,\u201d Raila said.\n\nThe former prime minister pledged to make an equal Kenya where everyone has access to education, employment and healthcare.\n\nSpeaking when he met a delegation of youths from Kiambu county, Raila promised to create a conducive environment for job creation to thousands who are unemployed, despite possessing requisite training.\n\nHe said manufacturing will be key in his administration where each subcounty will be encouraged to identify with one product and in the process create employment to the youths.\n\n\"We will bring industries through value addition to grow agriculture sectors that will create employment to our youth,\" he said.\n\n\"We must partner together.

Sometimes the dynamic has depended simply on the competition the game has been played in.\n\nSince 2010, 40 meetings have brought 16 Barcelona victories, 10 draws and 14 wins for Real Madrid.\n\nPep Guardiola's Barcelona team were the last to enjoy real dominance, beginning a run of five consecutive wins in 2008 that included a 6-2 thrashing at the Santiago Bernabeu and a 5-0 humiliation at Camp Nou. Across those five games, Barcelona claimed an aggregate score of 16-2.\n\nSince then, neither club had put together four wins on the bounce against the other, until this season, when Madrid ground out a 2-1 victory in the rain at Camp Nou in October, in what was the first meeting of the two clubs since Lionel Messi departed last summer.\n\nMadrid's ascendancy has not been so dramatic, or even, until recently, particularly noticeable. Unlike Guardiola's Barca, it is not dominance of ideas or style.

We're forgetting about the basics of football.\"\n\nReal Madrid sit 17 points clear of Barcelona in La Liga. They are on course to win the title while Barca would sign now for the top four. Karim Benzema and Vinicius Junior have scored only two fewer goals in the league than the entire Barca squad. In Europe, the two clubs are no longer even playing in the same competition.\n\nThe gap has widened, not because of Madrid's improvement this season under Ancelotti - although that has helped - but because of Barcelona's plunge into mediocrity.\n\nThe club's debts of more than a billion euros have dictated a decline that has been both fast and painful.\n\nYet there is perhaps also an opportunity for Barcelona if they can seize it, not just to end Madrid's winning streak but to attach a statement result to some less tangible signs of progress in recent weeks.\n\nXavi Hernandez's side are unbeaten in six games. They have moved out of La Liga's mid-table and sit only a point away from the top four. They have a system and a plan. They concede fewer goals, even if scoring them remains a problem.\n\nFerran Torres could be a solution and he is finally able to play after Samuel Umtiti's contract extension freed up space in the budget and he tested negative for Covid on Monday. Pedri, the team's best creator, is available again. Ansu Fati, who has not played since November, has also travelled to Riyadh.\n\nIt would, though, resemble something close to a cup upset if Barcelona were to avoid a fifth consecutive Clasico loss.

There is yet to be a scoreline that spells out their supremacy in capital letters.</p>\n\n<p>Yet Real Madrid are clear favourites on Wednesday in the semi-final of the Spanish Super Cup, staged not in Spain, but Saudi Arabia.</p>\n\n<p>The winner will play either Atletico Madrid or Athletic Bilbao in Sunday's final in Riyadh.</p>\n\n<p>Airlifting the competition 7,000 kilometres will earn the Spanish football federation around 300 million extra euros but the result has been outrage, not least because of Saudi Arabia's human rights record, even if the objections grow quieter every year.</p>\n\n<p>- 'Doesn't make sense' -In football terms, it adds to the sense of a tournament becoming more an exhibition than a serious trophy.</p>\n\n<p>\"It doesn't make sense,\" said Raul Garcia, whose Athletic Bilbao play Atletico Madrid on Thursday. \"These days it's all about money and sponsorships. We're forgetting about the basics of football.\"</p>\n\n<p>Real Madrid sit 17 points clear of Barcelona in La Liga. They are on course to win the title while Barca would sign now for the top four. Karim Benzema and Vinicius Junior have scored only two fewer goals in the league than the entire Barca squad. In Europe, the two clubs are no longer even playing in the same competition.</p>\n\n<p>The gap has widened, not because of Madrid's improvement this season under Ancelotti - although that has helped - but because of Barcelona's plunge into mediocrity.</p>\n\n<p>The club's debts of more than a billion euros have dictated a decline that has been both fast and painful.</p>\n\n<p>Yet there is perhaps also an opportunity for Barcelona if they can seize it, not just to end Madrid's winning streak but to attach a statement result to some less tangible signs of progress in recent weeks.</p>\n\n<p>Xavi Hernandez's side are unbeaten in six games. They have moved out of La Liga's mid-table and sit only a point away from the top four. They have a system and a plan. They concede fewer goals, even if scoring them remains a problem.</p>\n\n<p>Ferran Torres could be a solution and he is finally able to play after Samuel Umtiti's contract extension freed up space in the budget and he tested negative for Covid on Monday. Pedri, the team's best creator, is available again. Ansu Fati, who has not played since November, has also travelled to Riyadh.</p>\n\n<p>It would, though, resemble something close to a cup upset if Barcelona were to avoid a fifth consecutive Clasico loss. So heavy are the odds in Real Madrid's favour, many have suggested a narrow Madrid victory would count as a Barca success.</p>\n\n</article>", "canonicalUrl":

being turned into a political fodder by the DP's rivals", "articleBody": "Deputy President William Ruto has launched an aggressive campaign to further control the damage on his presidential bid following warmongering remarks by one of his close allies.\n\nFearing that the madoadoa slur had assumed political dimension, the DP on Monday warned his Tangatanga troops to be mindful of their language.\n\nThe slur was quickly turned into a political fodder by the DP's rivals.\n\nCoincidentally, Ruto was among those accused of being major perpetrators of the 2007-08 violence that landed him at the International Criminal Court in The Hague.\n\nSpeaking in Bomet on Monday, Ruto said his allies must desist from ethnic and tribal prejudices that could destabilise the country\u2019s social cohesion as the country gears to the August 9 polls.\n\nAccording to Ruto, United Democratic Alliance will not entertain warmongers who would be making reckless remarks that might be interpreted to mean that his 'hustler nation' is thriving in chaos and violence.\n\n\u201cI want to say here from Bomet that we don\u2019t subscribe to any divisive talk,\" Ruto said.\n\n\"We do not agree with any talks that profile individuals, or groups or communities because we are a national party that brings all communities of Kenya together.\u201d\n\nThe DP insisted that his troops must be measured in their statements in line with the UDA\u2019s ideology of bringing Kenyans together.\n\nUDA, he said, champions unity of the nation and does not subscribe to ethnic or regional, or village politics.\n\nThe DP was responding to a Saturday \u2018madoadoa\u2019 remark by Meru Senator Mithika linturi during his rally in Eldoret.\n\nThis was the first time the second in command was coming out to condemn Linturi\u2019s remarks, seen to be bordering on incitement.\n\nThe senator was arrested on Sunday and driven to Directorate of Criminal Investigations headquarters in Nairobi where he recorded a statement regarding the inflammatory remarks.\n\nHe is also expected to appear before the National Cohesion and Integration Commission on Wednesday.\n\nWhile condemning Linturi for his inappropriate use of language, Ruto also called for equal application of the law so as not to create a perception of two sets of law for different groups.\n\n\u201cI want to ask the institutions charged with making sure that we have a peaceful nation and election that they must apply the law in a manner that does not create two sets of laws for two sets of groups,\u201d he said\n\nHe added: \u201cWe want every inciter in Kenya, whether they belong in UDA or the other side, we want the law to apply equally so that we can secure our nation.\u201d\n\nHe welcomed the apology by the Meru senator, saying the 'hustler nation' is a home for all Kenyans and is at the forefront in preaching peaceful co-existence.\n\n\u201cLet me say that for those who are talking about Senator Linturi, he made a statement which he regrets; a statement that had inappropriate language, and... he has unconditionally apologised to the people of Kenya,\u201d Ruto said.\n\nHe spoke at Bomet Green Stadium where he staged a huge campaign rally to popularise his presidential bid.\n\nOn Sunday, presidential contenders Raila Odinga, Musalia Mudavadi (ANC) and Wiper leader Kalonzo Musyoka were united in condemning the inflammatory remarks, warning such incitement may compromise country\u2019s peace ahead of elections.\n\n\u201cWe know the language of incitement when we hear it. We heard what they said in Eldoret.
