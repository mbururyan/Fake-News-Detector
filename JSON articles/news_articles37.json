Caution has to be exercised.\n\nWe must keep apart when outdoors, wear masks and keep our sanitisers close.\n\nWith all the trouble, it makes you question whether going outside the safety of your home, especially with your children, is worth it.\n\nThings will be a little different this time round due to restrictions and all the regulations that must be adhered to, but that doesn\u2019t stop the fun.\n\nAt the rate at which the virus is mutating, the fear of contracting a new deadlier variant is high every day.

Consuming healthy and filling meals before going to a party will not only help you avoid overindulge but will help reduce cravings and help you stick to a healthy diet.\n\nIncrease vegetable intake\n\nWith all the sumptuous meals served during the holidays, it is tempting to take a break from vegetables. To avoid binging on high caloric foods and leaving your vegetables untouched, serve your vegetables first and have a fill on them before you can go for your favourites.\n\nYou could also have a bowl of vegetable salad before going to that party.

For example, if you are 50 kilogrammes, your minimum water intake should be 1.65 litres (50*0.033)\n\nThe holiday season is definitely a time for relaxing and having fun with friends and family. Sticking to a regular workout schedule may be challenging. To stay active, incorporate workouts in your family activities. For example, you can take walks as a family after a meal, ride a bike, play football or any other physically engaging game.\n\nDrink responsibly\n\nIf you must drink, moderate your intake by limiting it to the recommended two drinks or less for men or one drink or less for women.\n\nAlternate your drink with an equivalent or higher amount of water to help you cut on the amount consumed, stay hydrated and suppress your desire to consume high-calorie foods. Remember, alcohol intake is associated with many health effects whose risk increases with the amount consumed.\n\nThe holidays should be happy times so do not stress too much about your health goals and miss out on the fun.\n\nFind a balance between making healthier choices and enjoying the season.

This is because a lot of people have realized that there is potential when it comes to the digital world.\n\nThe options presented by the online platform are numerous and confusing, and you have to know the market deeply. These include blogs, online stores, thrift stores, and affiliate marketing, among others.\n\nTherefore, if you want to start an online business, this article will help you and give you insights on how to approach the online business idea.\n\nThis is not only to know how to start an online business, but what kind of business suits your situation. Therefore, I will raise some questions that you should evaluate before making any decision.\n\nThe online world does not perform miracles. Therefore, do not be fooled into thinking that you can make lots of money without working hard and knowing the techniques and tools involved in the business.\n\nMany people use the internet without commitment, posting funny content on Facebook, and sharing their favorite photos on Instagram. Another entirely different thing is to use the internet as a business and make money from it.\n\nYes, you can make a lot of money online, but you will have to take it as a serious business, seek training, and always stay updated. In the world of internet business, there is room for amateurism and improvement.\n\nSo if you want to know how to start an internet business, be sure and be willing to devote yourself to the business seriously.\n\n2. Find an area that excites you\n\nTo start an online business, you should first look for a segment with which you really identify with.\n\nSome fashion bloggers earn a lot of money because they like what they do and how they do it.\n\nIf you love fashion and want to write, then perhaps one of the business options for you to take on the internet can be a fashion blog. Here you can make money with Google AdSense, affiliate programs, sponsored posts, and sale of other space advertising.\n\nAnd if, in your case, writing is not your favorite activity, but you have excellent business acumen, the best option may be to start an e-commerce fashion store. You can then earn from the sales in your virtual store.\n\nAnd if neither one nor the other? Do you like fashion, but you neither want to be a blogger nor an owner of a shop, then your business is to teach. So, the best option may be to start an online course.\n\nThe important thing is to find something you are passionate about because working online is exhausting, and if you do not have a passion for what you do, as it is with any business, the chances of succeeding are slim.\n\n3. Know all the costs involved\n\nAnother tip for those who want to know how to start an online business is to know very well the costs involved.\n\nYou can indeed begin an internet business with a meager amount of investment, but it does not mean that you will not be making any money.\n\nIt is illusory to think that businesses on the internet are free, and they do not require any capital. Of course, they are far cheaper than in the physical world, but you have to invest.\n\nBe it a blog, an online store, or an online thrift store, you will have first to invest your time. You will also have to invest in training and digital marketing.\n\nSo get those costs before, to avoid surprises, and watch your business fail due to lack of financial strength to sustain it.\n\n4. Get training\n\nAt this point, you already know which online business idea you want to venture into. Therefore, seek training through good courses taught by recognized institutions. Have the ability to know the ins and outs of the business.\n\nAlthough some things on the internet seem intuitive, the truth is that behind everything you do in the online world, there are very technical and sophisticated tools that help a lot in the development of your business.\n\nAvoid the so-called \"gurus\" and \"sellers of pots of gold\" that have shortcuts and miraculous formulas to make money online. The only guys who make money with these methods are themselves.\n\n5. Draw up an action plan\n\nMy final tip for those who want to know how to start an online business is to develop an action plan to guide their steps.\n\nAs in the physical world, we need to establish a very detailed business plan so that we can achieve our goals and meet deadlines. Setting goals helps us to continually evaluate the progress of the project and make the necessary corrections.", "articleBodyHtml": "<article>\n\n<figure><img src=\"https://cdn.standardmedia.co.ke/sdemedia/sdeimages/monday/bez2u2ovqnyjoxw61ae1c310e98c.jpg\"><figcaption><strong>How to start a successful online business. </strong></figcaption></figure>\n\n<p>There are a lot of concerns about how to start an online business in Kenya and succeed.

Have the ability to know the ins and outs of the business.</p>\n\n<p>Although some things on the internet seem intuitive, the truth is that behind everything you do in the online world, there are very technical and sophisticated tools that help a lot in the development of your business.</p>\n\n<p>Avoid the so-called \"gurus\" and \"sellers of pots of gold\" that have shortcuts and miraculous formulas to make money online.

Suppose you begin every month with the best intentions not to overspend according to your budget, but ultimately find yourself buying needless things justified by the 'a little won't hurt' attitude. In that case, you are most likely to be looking at an empty bank account by the end of the month.\n\nTo curb overspending, you first have to admit that there is an issue when managing your finances, then take the measures required to take control of your money. Here are tips on how you can stop overspending.\n\nMake a budget\n\nAfter getting your paycheck, the first step is to take a hard look at what you earn versus how you want to spend the money. Looking at how much you spend buying luxury items, clothes or electronics can be a major wake-up call for you.\n\nCalculate the amount of money you earn every month from salary or other sources of income\nPrioritise your monthly bills, from rent to entertainment. Include savings in your budget. Try following the '50/30/20' rule, where 50 per cent of your monthly income goes to the necessary expenses, 30 per cent for entertainment and lifestyle preferences, and the other 20 per cent goes to savings or paying debts if any. Lastly, put your budget to the test and compare it to what you had initially planned. Make any adjustments if need be.\n\nStick to using cash\n\nUsing cash automatically prevents you from buying unplanned items, especially online. Instead, try using a cash-only envelope system when budgeting for your stuff, as this enables you to stick to the plan. Gather a few envelopes for all your adjustable expenses and label them according to how much you have allocated. Alternatively, set aside your weekly budget in one envelope and draw out the amount you need every day. The goal is to look for a plan that will help you stick to the budget.\n\nKnow your spending triggers\n\nMost people spend money without thinking about it. However, if you want to save money, knowing what your spending triggers are and why you have them can go a long way. Some of the things that trigger spending money include peer pressure from friends and family, current mood, or other factors that allow impulse buying, such as window shopping online. Keeping a diary is one of the best ways of tracking your spending triggers. It can help you gain control over overspending and limit how often you give in to the desire of impulse buying.\n\nTrack your expenses\n\nEven with the best intentions, most people find it challenging to stick to a budget. The truth is, an average person possibly thinks they know how they are using their money, but the reality is that most people cannot account for every penny spent every day. If you find yourself overspending despite having a budget, consider using a budget app to track where your money actually goes. Using a credit or debit card does not make it easier to track your expenses. To avoid overspending, do not save your credit card details on websites, as this makes checkout very easy. Also, leave your cards at home to limit the temptations of using them. However, if you do not want to go entirely card-free, give yourself some ground rules for using them.", "articleBodyHtml": "<article>\n\n<figure><img src=\"https://cdn.standardmedia.co.ke/sdemedia/sdeimages/monday/kjcgjcnork6gj61b716e58b25b.jpg\"><figcaption><strong>A man budgeting his expenses. </strong></figcaption></figure>\n\n<p>Spending money never gets old, and it is not necessarily a bad thing.
