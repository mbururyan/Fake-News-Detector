The International Criminal Court (ICC) early in February convicted Dominic On\u2019gwen, a Ugandan Child Soldier turned Lord\u2019s Resistance Army (LRA) commander\u2026", "articleBody": "What is the background story?\n\nThe International Criminal Court (ICC) early in February convicted Dominic On\u2019gwen, a Ugandan Child Soldier turned Lord\u2019s Resistance Army (LRA) commander of war and crimes against humanity. He was found guilty of 61 charges including murder, widespread rape, sexual enslavement, abducting children, torture and pillaging carried out in the early 2000s. He could serve a jail term. The convict\u2019s lawyer\u2019s argument in his defence was that Mr On\u2019gwen had suffered psychological damage as a result of being abducted as a child and was himself a \u201cvictim\u201d.\n\nWhat then is a child soldier?\n\nThe United Nations Convention on the Rights of the Child defines child as \u2018a human being below the age of 18 years\u2019. A child soldier is any girl or boy below the age of 18 who is recruited or used by an armed force or armed group, in any capacity not necessarily involved in actual fighting. Children have been used as cooks, suicide bombers, human shields, messengers, spies, or for sexual purposes. The Coalition to Stop the Use of Child Soldiers estimates that there are over 300,000 children under the age of 18 serving as child soldiers with government armed forces and armed opposition groups worldwide, with over 120,000 of them located in Sub-Saharan Africa alone. Girls make up an estimated 10 to 30 per cent of the child soldiers.\n\nHow are child soldiers recruited?\n\nThe techniques used in the creation of child soldiers tend to share a few common themes. First, there is the replacement of parents with a surrogate. The child may be an orphan looking for security, or a kidnap victim whose parents have been killed in the raid. In some cases, the child is forced to commit an atrocity against his family or village that will make the child think that he would be unwelcome back at home. The child, having stripped off a parental authority figure, the commander steps into the role.\n\nChildren who are not forced to be soldiers volunteer themselves because they feel societal pressure and are under the impression that volunteering will provide a form of income, food, or security, and willingly join the group.\n\nWhy do commanders prefer child soldiers?\n\nCommanders in the field become their foster parents and hence the child ends up being more obedient and easier to manipulate than the average adult soldier. According to a report on Sierra Leone by Human Rights Watch:\n\n\u201cYoung boys are targeted in part because their captors consider them to be less afraid to fight; they likely do not have children or wives to consider in risking their lives. They are readily manipulated because they are vulnerable and without protection.\u201d\n\nAlthough some commanders may be enthusiastic about using child soldiers, and the weaponry today may lend itself to use by smaller soldiers, this does not mean that the children are well trained. Children make poor soldiers, as the work is physically demanding and they lack the upper-body strength of an adult. Their lack of experience and their immaturity leads to unnecessary risk-taking, and is reflected in their higher casualty rates. Children are seen as being more expendable than better-trained adult soldiers, and are used in dangerous assaults, clearing mines, and as spies.\n\nHow are child soldiers deployed in conflict situations?\n\nAlthough the use of children in warfare is not in itself new, the scale of their involvement varies in so many ways. Teenage boys have always participated in battlefield non-combat tasks, such as runners and drummers, but never in the numbers seen today. Several thousands of children served in resistance movements during the 1939-45 War, and in many of the colonial liberation wars of the 1950s and 1960s. The modern jihadist movements commonly use children as suicide bombers. Using the child in modern conflicts is also the norm partly due to the fact that modern assault rifles are lighter and easier to use than their predecessors.\n\nFor example, the ubiquitous AK-47 weighs only 9.5 pounds, is easy to use and maintain, and is widely available, with between 35 and 50 million in existence. The M-16 rifle weighs 6.4 pounds, with about 8 million in existence. Children can handle these weapons with little difficulty. The light weight and ease of use of modern small-arms has thus facilitated the recruitment of children in modern war.\n\nIs there any justification of using a child solder?\n\nBeyond the obvious distaste with using children in such dangerous and violent work, could it not be argued that they equally share in the fate of their nation? When faced with annihilation doesn\u2019t a nation have the right to turn to whatever resources it has to aid in the fight? The child has no mental balance to make a decision on matters of life and death.\n\nHow does conflict affect the child soldier?\n\nFour main ways spring to mind:\n\nThe use of a child as a combatant creates a more unpredictable and unstable soldier than an adult while exacting a more acute impact psychological cost on the child.\nChild soldiers have poorer training than their adult counterparts, are more disposed to taking risks, and are preferred by some commanders because they can be forced to do things that adults would not.\nChild soldiers are trained to overcome a reluctance to kill through operant conditioning. Children brutalized in this way suffer from severe emotional problems, and these problems remain into adulthood.\nAnother aspect of the use of child soldiers is the long-term risks associated with Post-Traumatic Stress Disorder (PTSD). The stress of losing their families, being uprooted from their homes, and being physically, psychologically and sexually abused will leave the children traumatized. As the nations were, this kind of activity occurs are almost invariably poor, it is unlikely that mental health care will be available to treat them for PTSD.\n\nHow does the law of armed conflict plead for the child?\n\nThe Laws of Armed Conflict make a special case for children. They do so because the psychological damage inflicted upon children by participation in combat is contrary to the long-term aim of the Laws of armed conflict: To reduce suffering of the victims and to establish conditions favourable to a viable and lasting peace. Children that have been brutalized by combat grow up to be dangerous adults invariably only resorting to violence to solve their problems.\n\nWhat are the final thoughts?\n\nThe use of children in combat is a growing phenomenon that has negative consequences at all levels. Individually, the child suffers in both psychological and moral development. Society suffers because of the cost of bearing a generation that knows only violence. Progress is being made diplomatically to outlaw the use of children in combat. The nations that use child soldiers cannot afford to rehabilitate them, but leaving them untreated places many developing countries at risk. The cost of treating these children will still be considerably less than replacing the infrastructure lost to wars caused by a generation of children that were taught only violence.", "articleBodyHtml": "<article>\n\n<p><strong>What is the background story?</strong></p>\n\n<p>The International Criminal Court (ICC) early in February convicted Dominic On\u2019gwen, a Ugandan Child Soldier turned Lord\u2019s Resistance Army (LRA) commander of war and crimes against humanity.

replacing the infrastructure lost to wars caused by a generation of children that were taught only violence.</p>\n\n<figure><img src=\"https://thetimes.co.ke/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/3-1.jpg\"

billion modern, state-of-the-art housing project is a serious issue and deserves conservatory orders from the court.\n\nThe aggrieved party under the umbrella of Buxton Welfare Association (BWA) through their counsel Gikandi Ngibuini said they are not ready to deal with the petition before the court in a casual manner.\n\nNgibuini said justice cannot be compromised at the court as the tenants who double up as the aggrieved party pay their monthly rent of Sh 3,500.\n\n\u201cThe aggrieved party has lived in their rental houses for decades now,\u201d he told the court.\n\nGikandi pointed out the second interested party [Buxton Point Apartment] before the disputed matter is a private entity and has a joint venture agreement with the Mombasa county government which is in the public domain.\n\nHe was making his oral submission against the project before Justice Munyao Sila in an open court at the parking bay of the Mombasa law courts in Mombasa county where judgment was set for March 3.\n\nThe aggrieved party\u2019s counsel told the court anybody who comes across the venture agreement can\u2019t fail to see the owner of the project is being gifted with 14acres of prime part of land in Mombasa county.\n\nGikandi said in his oral submission that the land on which the proposed housing project is to take place is the fat part of a cow.\n\nHe insisted the end result of the venture agreement is to get the 14 acre land and demanded an explanation about the current ownership of the land.\n\n\u201cThe 14 acres of land is leased by the national government and the county government and the private developer lacks legal rights to use the land for development,\u201d he pointed out.\n\nLast year, the aggrieved residents opposed the proposed state-of-the-art housing project with a public participation exercise being marked with divisions as each side wanted to be heard while the fate of the project awaited the outcome of an Environmental Impact Assessment (EIA) by the National Environment Management Authority (NEMA).\n\nThe aggrieved party alleged the project developer Suleiman Shahbal used to oppose the project when it was owned by the defunct Mombasa Municipal Council.\n\nThe aggrieved party want the project stopped citing lack of proper public participation and are opposed to the mortgage scheme preferring a tenant purchase scheme.\n\nThey also established that a letter has been sent to financial institutions warning them to keep off the controversial project.\n\nA day before the signing of the document to suspend the project at the estate of 520 units with almost 2500 families those opposed to the project held a media briefing organized by former Mombasa senator Omar Sarai and Nyali MP Mohamed Ali alias Jicho Pevu. Also present at the Renaissance Centre in Mvita constituency, Mombasa county was United Green Movement [UGM] General Secretary Hamisa Maalim Zaja.\n\nThe Nyali legislator pointed an accusing finger at Mombasa governor Hassan Ali Joho for allegedly making a political deal with his former political rival Shahbal who has ambitions to succeed him as governor in the 2022 general elections.", "articleBodyHtml": "<article>\n\n<p>The petition against the demolition of old dilapidated houses at the famous Buxton Estate in Mvita Constituency, Mombasa County for a\u00a0proposed Sh 6 billion modern, state-of-the-art housing project is a serious issue and deserves conservatory orders from the court.</p>\n\n<p>The\u00a0aggrieved party under the umbrella of Buxton Welfare Association (BWA)\u00a0through their counsel\u00a0Gikandi\u00a0Ngibuini said they are not ready to deal with the petition before the court in a casual manner.</p>\n\n<p>Ngibuini said justice cannot be compromised at the court as the tenants who double up as the aggrieved party pay their monthly rent of Sh 3,500.</p>\n\n<blockquote><p>\u201cThe aggrieved party has lived in their rental houses for decades now,\u201d he told the court.</p></blockquote>\n\n<p>Gikandi\u00a0pointed out the second interested party [Buxton Point Apartment] before the disputed matter is a private entity and has a joint venture agreement with the Mombasa county government which is in the public domain.</p>\n\n<p>He was making his oral submission against the project before\u00a0Justice Munyao Sila in an open court at the parking bay of the Mombasa law courts in Mombasa county where judgment was set for March 3.</p>\n\n<p>The aggrieved party\u2019s counsel told the court anybody who comes across the venture agreement can\u2019t fail to see the owner of the project is being gifted with 14acres of prime part of land in Mombasa county.</p>\n\n<p>Gikandi\u00a0said in his oral submission that the land on which the\u00a0proposed housing project is to take place is\u00a0the fat part of a cow.</p>\n\n<p>He insisted the end result of the venture agreement is to get the 14 acre land and demanded an explanation about the current ownership of the land.</p>\n\n<blockquote><p>\u201cThe 14 acres of land is leased by the national government and the county government and the private developer lacks legal rights to use the land for development,\u201d he pointed out.</p></blockquote>\n\n<p>Last year, the aggrieved\u00a0residents\u00a0opposed the proposed state-of-the-art housing project with a public participation exercise being marked with divisions as each side wanted to be heard while the fate of the project awaited the outcome of an\u00a0Environmental Impact Assessment (EIA) by the\u00a0National Environment Management Authority\u00a0(NEMA).</p>\n\n<p>The aggrieved party\u00a0alleged the project developer\u00a0Suleiman Shahbal used to oppose the project when it was\u00a0owned by the defunct Mombasa Municipal Council.</p>\n\n<p>The aggrieved party want the project stopped citing\u00a0lack of proper public participation and are opposed to the mortgage scheme preferring a\u00a0tenant purchase scheme.</p>\n\n<p>They also established that a letter has been sent to financial institutions warning them to keep off the controversial project.</p>\n\n<p>A day before the signing of the document to suspend the project at the estate of 520 units with almost 2500 families those opposed to the project held a media briefing organized by former Mombasa senator Omar Sarai and Nyali MP Mohamed Ali alias Jicho Pevu.
