Sources say the procurement of the bus did not follow the right procedure. Already, the university\u2019s tender committee is under pressure to approve procurement of a certain finance system (Enterprise Resource Planning System) at a cost of Sh20million.\n\nThe NICIC officers are said to be investigating claims of irregular hiring, promotion and firing of university staff. Of interest is one Mr Omuse who is a computer technician. Sources said in the last two years, Omuse has been promoted two times and is now in grade 12. Those who know him well say that his academic and professional qualifications do not allow him to be in grade 12.\n\nThe EACC is also said to be investigating circumstances under which Omuse took Sh990,000 in cash to pay for subscription by university to Africa association of universities and others. This money was allegedly approved by the VC and up to date, this money has never been accounted for.\n\nIt is claimed that the VC has gone tribal and creates positions for people from her ethnic community or to people who are loyal to her and who never raises queries on issues and directives and orders by the VC. The NCIC is also said to be investigating claims that most heads, chairmen and directors are appointed on tribal basis as close to 80 pc are from same ethnic community.\n\nAlready, word is out that some of her trusted and loyal lieutenants who have reached retirement age are still being retained. The officers who are said to have reached retirement age but are still in payroll are security officer, human resource officer and registrar academic affairs.\n\nSources say the VC has been single handedly appointing temporary staff while retrenching casuals who have worked for the university for many years on continuous basis. The VC allegedly employed Prof Oyaro\u2019s wife unprocedurally. Oyaro is the dean of Science.\n\nThe EACC, according to well-placed sources, has also been called upon to investigate an allegation that the VC is plotting on how to clear Prof David Serem of a debt of Sh9million from the suspense account. Serem is a former Principal of Maasai Mara University. When the finance officer detected the plot, he objected and was sent on forced leave. It is suspected that the VC cleared Serem during the absence of the finance officer.\n\nOn mismanagement of university funds, the letter claims that she has been visiting all over the world and financing Chinese and French to visit Narok to see the so-called botanical garden and in all her visits, there has been no impact or returns which is a clear case of misuse of university funds.\n\nThe letter further claims that the VC goes to Nairobi on Thursdays and Fridays and the trips are fully financed by the university claiming she is on official duties but investigations have revealed that she travels to Nairobi to attend classes. She is currently doing MBA at the University of Nairobi.\n\nIt is claimed that the university looses close to Sh100,000 every week through the VC\u2019s office for security purposes. Sources say whenever she travels to Nairobi; she is accompanied by a bodyguard who is paid allowances which are made in cash.\n\nIt is alleged that in all her dealings, she does not append her signature on approved documents and only puts initials (VC and the date) and rather than signing and approving the original documents, she does it on photocopies of the same documents.\n\nThe letter further alleges that the VC has hired the services of one Makokha who is a former university employee to spy on the university staff and another from Safaricom to tap other staff phones. On political patronage, she is said to have been sending emissaries to William ole Ntimama in an effort to compromise him. Sources say the VC has now employed a close relative to Ntimama in an effort to silence him.\n\nOne of the projects under investigations is the Sh15billion hospital. Stakeholders are wondering what happened to the project and if there was money allocated, where did it go? It is imperative to note that no single project has been done at the university since her appointment despite taxpayers\u2019 money channeled to the university for the last two years amounting to Sh300 million for projects.\n\nThe EACC is also said to have been investigating claims that the University Council chairman Joseph Okumu who through the influence of the VC has become an executive chairman. Records indicate that he draws a monthly allowance of close to Sh350,000 per month. The EACC sleuths are said to be pursuing documents which shows that he draws Sh80,000 responsibility allowances instead of Sh25,000.\n\nSources say Okumu is now performing administrative activities on a daily basis in which he addresses all deans of schools and all heads of departments and also signs letters of appointments to staff. A good example is that he signed for Ogola to act as the dean school of education.\n\nSources say the VC is manipulating the chairman by all means by approving and giving him allowances and honoraria on a daily basis. The two also possess some issues together without the knowledge of the full council of the university.\n\nPart time lecturers at the Maasai Mara University are also bitterly complaining that they are never paid and are owed hundreds of thousands in unpaid salaries and allowances.\n\nAlso under investigations are circumstances under which the VC brought the Presbyterian University students to graduate at Maasai Mara University during the third graduation ceremony.", "articleBodyHtml": "<article>\n\n<p><strong>Our Reporter</strong></p>\n\n<p>The National Cohesion and Integration\nCommission officers have pitched tent at the Maasai Mara University probing\nclaims of nepotism, tribalism, irregular hiring and firing of staff as well as\ncorruption related activities.</p>\n\n<p>The NCIC officers were\nacting on a tip-off through an</p>\n\n<figure><a href=\"https://1.bp.blogspot.com/-v5BBhbMB1XU/Vsq-wefWJCI/AAAAAAAACTY/L0_AALo1dsI/s1600/vc.png\"><img src=\"https://1.bp.blogspot.com/-v5BBhbMB1XU/Vsq-wefWJCI/AAAAAAAACTY/L0_AALo1dsI/s320/vc.png\"></a></figure>\n\n<p>anonymous letter addressed to it and copied to\nthe Ethics and Anti Corruption Commission, cabinet secretary ministry of\nEducation, Governor Narok county and area MP Ole Kenta.</p>\n\n<p>Under corruption related\nactivities, the EACC is also said to be investigating the procurement of a car\nfor the VC, Mary Waling\u2019o at a cost of Sh12million but sources say the market\nvalue is far below the Sh12million.

In essence, we are showing our people the way forward when it comes to voting in 2017,\u2019\u2019 said Barua. Other sources in the retreat said they were convinced Waweru was a suitable candidate for the job, describing him as \u201csober and untainted\u201d.\nThe sources intimated that they had, in principal, agreed to rally their communities behind Waweru and at the same time to reach out to other communities under JAP for support.\nThe move by the MPs comes hot on the heels of the election of Ferdinand Waititu as the MP for Kabete, effectively shifting his political base from Nairobi to Kiambu, where he has stirred political calm by declaring that he will oppose the incumbent governor William Kabogo in 2017.\nWaweru agreed that an endorsement by the Mt Kenya communities would give him a head-start in the race. \u201cThe fact that MPs from the region have faith in me means I stand a better chance of capturing the seat,\u2019\u2019 he said.\nAmong senators who attended the meeting were Kiraitu Murungi (Meru) and Kimani Wa Matangi (Kiambu). Notable absentee was Tharaka Nithi Senator Kithure Kindiki who was said to have sent an apology. During the two-day retreat the legislators resolved that small parties from the region be merged under JAP to ensure a block vote for President Uhuru and his deputy William Ruto in 2017.\nIn a statement read to the press by Waweru, the leaders said the only way to ensure re-election of the Jubilee government is to use JAP as the sole vehicle in elections. \u201cWe will dialogue with other like-minded parties and leaders to form a strong political vehicle to propel Uhuru and Ruto to win a second term in office,\u2019\u2019 said Waweru, adding that the parties would \u201cconsolidate their operations, structures and functions\u201d.\nKiraitu, who agreed to merge his Alliance Party of Kenya alias \u2018Bus\u2019, said they agreed to meet early to lay out strategies that could win Jubilee a second term. \u201cUnlike before, we have resolved to convene early so as to strategise on how the President and his deputy will retain their seats in 2017.\nWe want to consolidate our unity in this region before consulting other like-minded parties,\u201d said Kiraitu.

We have however discovered that Uhuru\u2019s attempts to reconcile the two families had hit a concrete wall.\n\nAnalysts now claim that it was after the failed attempts that Uhuru has of late been tactically visiting Rift Valley especially in the company of his\n\ndeputy. Early in the month, Uhuru did not attend the Nandi County Investment Forum with only Ruto attended the highly publicized function held at Kapsabet town.\n\nUhuru also cancelled at the eleventh hour his planned trip to Eldoret where he was to attend the ASK show in Eldoret. It later emerged that Uhuru was not able to attend the two events because it was not in his diary.\n\nIt has been whispered that Uhuru cancelled a tour to Eldoret town on after he received intelligence reports that farmers and some local leaders had planned to confront him with demands on the maize crisis. He was to open the Eldoret ASK national show and attend other activities for the Uasin Gishu county government, but the plan was cancelled under unclear circumstances.\n\nSources say Uhuru Uhuru and Moi had held close to five meeting in the absence of Ruto with only Ruto attending one meeting at State House while the rest of the meetings have either been held at Mois\u2019 Kabarak home or at his Kabarnet Gardens home in Nairobi.\n\nUhuru\u2019s failure to reconcile the two families has got to do with two factors. One, Moi has never forgiven Ruto for taking away the Kalenjins from Kanu to ODM during the 2007 elections in which three of his sons including Gideon lost in various parliamentary elections.\n\nMoi believes Ruto who is his political student and who owes his political standing to Moi stole the mandate as Kalenjin leader in 2007 and remarks he made against Moi in the run-up to the then hotly contested elections have never been forgotten.\n\nEven when Uhuru teamed up with Ruto in 2013, Moi had attempted to have Uhuru run on Kanu ticket with Gideon as running mate but Uhuru handlers did not want to hear anything to do with Kanu.\n\nAnalysts say that as much as Uhuru is trying to reconcile the two families, it is unachievable since the elder Moi has never handed him the leadership mantle of the Kalenjin and does not even want to meet him hence the reason why he has been conspicuously missing during Uhuru-Moi meetings.\n\nBefore the dust could settle after the failed reconciliation, Bomet governor Isaac Ruto also declared that he was ready to team up with Gideon to teach Ruto a lesson in 2017.\n\nThe announcement caught the DP wrong-footed and while in Kapkatet, he issued an onslaught saying that Kalenjin politicians not singing his tune will be kicked out in the next election. But Ruto and Gideon in a quick rejoinder laughed off the warning and promised him a political battle of his lifetime in 2017.\n\nBoth Ruto and Gideon have time and again accused the DP funding their political rivals, who include MPs and a number of Ward Representatives, to destabilise them politically.\n\nUhuru strategists are however aware of new political realignments in the offing in Rift Valley ahead of the 2017 election, with Kanu-URP rebels rolling out strategies to take control of the vote-rich region.\n\nTrouble for Uhuru now and the reason behind his many attempts to reconcile the Moi-Ruto families is to avoid a situation whereby Kanu sponsors Gideon as its presidential flagbearer against him.\n\nAnother reason why Uhuru has taken up the responsibility of bringing the Moi family on board is the future of the Ruto case at the ICC. Uhuru informers believe that should Ruto be jailed and with Gideon leading a strong Kanu, the Kalenjin votes could be as well gone since the Kalenjins would not be comfortable voting with Jubilee in the absence of Ruto.\n\nIt is also important to take note that although Kanu did not contest the presidency in 2013, the party still enjoys reasonable following in Rift Valley and this is something Uhuru and Ruto cannot ignore.\n\nDuring the last general elections, despite the URP wave, Kanu won 6 parliamentary seats in Rift Valley and two senatorial. Despite campaigns by Ruto against Gideon in Baringo county senatorial race, Gideon managed 124,425 votes against Ruto\u2019s man Jackson koskei who flew the URP flag and garnered 23,591 votes while ODM\u2019s candidate Edward Kateiya got a paltry 8,462 votes.\n\nBaringo County a Kanu stronghold in the 2013 General Election, with Gideon winning the Senate seat despite vigorous campaigns by Ruto and Uhuru who pitched camp in Baringo County twice in the run-up to the polls.\n\nBut what is giving Uhuru sleepless nights is the uncertainty over the outcome of the ICC case facing Ruto and the merger of URP and TNA to form JAP which has triggering discontent among some members of the Kalenjin community and Rift Valley voters at large.\n\nWhereas Ruto has laughed off Gideon\u2019s entry into presidential race, Uhuru and his handlers know what damage Gideon\u2019s entry into the race can do to Uhuru\u2019s 2017 bid.\n\nAs Uhuru works overtime to bring the Moi family on board, Ruto is said to be busy plotting on how to clip Ruto\u2019s political wings in Rift Valley also specifically in Baringo County where Gideon literally controls. AT one time, Ruto was quoted saying \u201cYou must accept to be led,\neven if your father led the country for 24 years. Stop dividing the\nKalenjin\u201d.\n\nInvestigations now reeval that the battle lines have also been extended to Baringo County where URP is allegedly grooming former East Africa Co-operation Minister Musa Sirma to out-seat the Gideon as senator in 2017 he withdraws from presidential race to defend his senatorial seat.\n\nGideon is also said to be plotting on how his strong men will take on Ruto\u2019s allies in Baringo. He is said to be grooming the suspended Assembly Speaker William Kamket to take on the URP MP Asman Kamama. Kamket vied unsuccessfully for the Tiaty parliamentary seat on a Kanu ticket but lost to URP\u2019s Asman Kamama.\n\nAnother concern of Uhuru and by extension other top Kalenjin politicians and professionals is whether Ruto can succeed Uhuru in 2022 without Moi\u2019s blessings.\n\nA story is told that after the Ravine Declaration of 2006 where Ruto declared his candidature for presidency he and his entourage drove to Moi\u2019s Kabarak home to seek blessings. It is alleged that Moi didn\u2019t open the gate for them for he knew Ruto was not up to the task. Todate Moi has never changed his mind.\n\nLast week, Moi has dismissed reports alleging he met with Uhuru and Ruto at State House Nairobi. This happened at a time when Ruto claimed that his political rivals led by Gideon and Ruto were rejoicing about his ICC tribulations.\n\nThose who have been following the Kalenjin politics as they unfold will agree that Gideon has identified Ruto\u2019s weaknesses in government and has been using them to attack the DP during his countrywide meet-the-people tours on the DP\u2019s home turf.\n\nThe issues include claims that the DP has been reluctant to bring pressure to bear for better pricing of maize in the North Rift and tea prices in the South Rift, as well as his lack of steam to push for a whole raft of pre-election campaign pledges to the region.\n\nIt is now said that for Uhuru to reconcile the two families, he must also reach out to individuals from within the Baringo County. Names that are being flouted that could see the deal brokered successfully includes those of Benjamin Cheboi (Baringo governor), Joshua Kulei (former President Moi\u2019s private secretary), Daniel Kibelion who is a prominent businessman and the proprietor of the Kibelion Hotel in Emining a popular tourist destination and Asman Kamama (MP for Tiaty).\n\nOthers are Moses Lessonet (Eldama Ravine), William Cheptumo (Baringo North), Prof Hellen Sambili, Sammy Mwaita (Baringo Central), Grace Kiptui (Baringo County Women\u2019s Representative), Grace Kipchoim (Baringo South), Musa Sirma, Leut Gen Joseph Kasaon, Rtd Gen Daudi Tonje, Phyllis Kandie (Cabinet Secretary for East African Affairs, Commerce and Tourism), Amb Lucy Chelimo, Prof James Tuitoek, Alicen Chelaite, Eric Kotut who is the former Central Bank governor and is one of the key businessmen in Baringo who has invested heavily in the flower sector and Dr. Edward Sambili.\n\nBut even Uhuru seems to be willing to work with Ruto and his allies in 2017 and even beyond, Ruto allies are not comfortable with Uhuru\u2019s close links with Gideon and the Moi family. Uhuru\u2019s strageists are said to have advised him to groom Gideon should the ICC jail Ruto or should Ruto decide to run against him in 2017.\n\nTo show how close Uhuru and Gideon are and to begin with, the Mois and the Kenyattas have a long history and an interesting future that is already unfolding in the ongoing power struggle.\n\nGideon has accompanied Uhuru to Sudan and AU summits in Ethiopia as well as to the billionaire playgrounds of Dubai to watch the elitist Formula One motor racing sport. Uhuru accompanied Gideon to the famous Kimalel goat auction where Ruto\u2019s absence was conspicous.\n\nEyebrows shot up throughout the diplomatic community in June 2014, when the United Nations Environment Assembly opened its Segment Summit and Gideon was given the official protocol duties of escorting Prince Albert II of Monaco, who attended the world environmental body\u2019s four-day conference in Nairobi.\n\nIt was not lost on observers that Gideon escorted Albert II even to social functions and on his outings from the business of the summit. Like Albert II, Gideon is a polo enthusiast.\n\nThis unique protocol duty at Uhuru\u2019s request underscored those meetings that the head of state has had with both Gideon and Mzee Moi at the latter\u2019s Kabarnet Gardens residence and elsewhere.\n\nIt was also no surprise that it was Gideon himself who recommended Uhuru for the award of the honourary Doctor of Leadership degree at Kabarak University\u2019s 10th graduation ceremony.", "articleBodyHtml": "<article>\n\n<p>Attempts\nby President Uhuru Kenyatta to reconcile the family of retired President Daniel\narap Moi and that of the Deputy President William Ruto has finally hit a dead\nend, we can authoritatively revel this week.</p>\n\n<p>Uhuru\nand his political handlers have been lately concerned over the political\ntension in the Rift Valley region which has heightened with the recent\nannouncement by Kanu that it will sponsor Gideon Moi, the Baringo Senator, to\nrun for the top seat in 2017.</p>\n\n<p>The\nfear within the Uhuru camp is that should Kanu clear Gideon to run against\nUhuru in 2017, then even with Ruto as Uhuru\u2019s running mate, the Kalenjin votes\nwill be divided and this will be to the advantage of Cord.</p>\n\n<p>Another\nconcern for Uhuru is that there are so many sideshows on the political front in\nRift Valley and the deep politics development\u00a0that is unfolding behind the\nscenes but which has far-reaching implications for Uhuru\u2019s presidential bid in 2017.</p>\n\n<p>Even\nthough analysts say that Ruto is not bothered with Gideon\u2019s attempts to wrestle\nthe Kalenjin control from him, the larger Jubilee family is the most worried\nlot since without a block Kalenjin vote, Uhuru is likely to be a one-term\npresident.</p>\n\n<p>It\nis against such fears that Uhuru had reached out for the older Moi to broker a\ndeal that would see Gideon go slow on Ruto and to have the region leaders\nunited ahead of 2017 elections. We have however discovered that Uhuru\u2019s attempts\nto reconcile the two families had hit a concrete wall.</p>\n\n<p>Analysts\nnow claim that it was after the failed attempts that Uhuru has of late been\ntactically visiting Rift Valley especially in the company of his</p>\n\n<p>deputy.\nEarly in the month, Uhuru did not attend the Nandi County Investment Forum with\nonly Ruto attended the highly publicized function held at Kapsabet town.</p>\n\n<p>Uhuru\nalso cancelled at the eleventh hour his planned trip to Eldoret where he was to\nattend the ASK show in Eldoret. It later emerged that Uhuru was not able to\nattend the two events because it was not in his diary.</p>\n\n<p>It\nhas been whispered that Uhuru cancelled a tour to Eldoret town on after he\nreceived intelligence reports that farmers and some local leaders had planned\nto confront him with demands on the maize crisis. He was to open the Eldoret\nASK national show and attend other activities for the Uasin Gishu county\ngovernment, but the plan was cancelled under unclear circumstances.</p>\n\n<p>Sources\nsay Uhuru Uhuru and Moi had held close to five meeting in the absence of Ruto\nwith only Ruto attending one meeting at State House while the rest of the\nmeetings have either been held at Mois\u2019 Kabarak home or at his Kabarnet Gardens\nhome in Nairobi.</p>\n\n<p>Uhuru\u2019s\nfailure to reconcile the two families has got to do with two factors. One, Moi\nhas never forgiven Ruto for taking away the Kalenjins from Kanu to ODM during\nthe 2007 elections in which three of his sons including Gideon lost in various\nparliamentary elections.</p>\n\n<p>Moi\nbelieves Ruto who is his political student and who owes his political standing\nto Moi stole the mandate as Kalenjin leader in 2007 and remarks he made against\nMoi in the run-up to the then hotly contested elections have never been\nforgotten.</p>\n\n<p>Even\nwhen Uhuru teamed up with Ruto in 2013, Moi had attempted to have Uhuru run on\nKanu ticket with Gideon as running mate but Uhuru handlers did not want to hear\nanything to do with Kanu.</p>\n\n<p>Analysts\nsay that as much as Uhuru is trying to reconcile the two families, it is\nunachievable since the elder Moi has never handed him the leadership mantle of\nthe Kalenjin and does not even want to meet him hence the reason why he has\nbeen conspicuously missing during Uhuru-Moi meetings.</p>\n\n<p>Before\nthe dust could settle after the failed reconciliation, Bomet governor Isaac Ruto\nalso declared that he was ready to team up with Gideon to teach Ruto a lesson\nin 2017.</p>\n\n<p>The\nannouncement caught the DP wrong-footed and while in Kapkatet, he issued an\nonslaught saying that Kalenjin politicians not singing his tune will be kicked\nout in the next election. But Ruto and Gideon in a quick rejoinder laughed off\nthe warning and promised him a political battle of his lifetime in 2017.</p>\n\n<p>Both\nRuto and Gideon have time and again accused the DP funding their political\nrivals, who include MPs and a number of Ward Representatives, to destabilise them\npolitically.</p>\n\n<p>Uhuru\nstrategists are however aware of new political realignments in the offing in\nRift Valley ahead of the 2017 election, with Kanu-URP rebels rolling out\nstrategies to take control of the vote-rich region.</p>\n\n<p>Trouble\nfor Uhuru now and the reason behind his many attempts to reconcile the Moi-Ruto\nfamilies is to avoid a situation whereby Kanu sponsors Gideon as its\npresidential flagbearer against him.</p>\n\n<p>Another\nreason why Uhuru has taken up the responsibility of bringing the Moi family on\nboard is the future of the Ruto case at the ICC. Uhuru informers believe that\nshould Ruto be jailed and with Gideon leading a strong Kanu, the Kalenjin votes\ncould be as well gone since the Kalenjins would not be comfortable voting with\nJubilee in the absence of Ruto.</p>\n\n<p>It\nis also important to take note that although Kanu did not contest the\npresidency in 2013, the party still enjoys reasonable following in Rift Valley\nand this is something Uhuru and Ruto cannot ignore.</p>\n\n<p>During\nthe last general elections, despite the URP wave, Kanu won 6 parliamentary\nseats in Rift Valley and two senatorial. Despite campaigns by Ruto against\nGideon in Baringo county senatorial race, Gideon managed 124,425 votes against\nRuto\u2019s man Jackson koskei who flew the URP flag and garnered 23,591 votes while\nODM\u2019s candidate Edward Kateiya got a paltry 8,462 votes.</p>\n\n<p>Baringo\nCounty a Kanu stronghold in the 2013 General Election, with Gideon winning the\nSenate seat despite vigorous campaigns by Ruto and Uhuru who pitched camp in\nBaringo County twice in the run-up to the polls.</p>\n\n<p>But\nwhat is giving Uhuru sleepless nights is the uncertainty over the outcome of\nthe ICC case facing Ruto and the merger of URP and TNA to form JAP which has\ntriggering discontent among some members of the Kalenjin community and Rift\nValley voters at large.</p>\n\n<p>Whereas\nRuto has laughed off Gideon\u2019s entry into presidential race, Uhuru and his\nhandlers know what damage Gideon\u2019s entry into the race can do to Uhuru\u2019s 2017\nbid.</p>\n\n<p>As\nUhuru works overtime to bring the Moi family on board, Ruto is said to be busy\nplotting on how to clip Ruto\u2019s political wings in Rift Valley also specifically\nin Baringo County where Gideon literally controls. AT one time, Ruto was quoted\nsaying \u201cYou must accept to be led,<br>\neven if your father led the country for 24 years. Stop dividing the<br>\nKalenjin\u201d.</p>\n\n<p>Investigations\nnow reeval that the battle lines have also been extended to Baringo County\nwhere URP is allegedly grooming former East Africa Co-operation Minister Musa\nSirma to out-seat the Gideon as senator in 2017 he withdraws from presidential\nrace to defend his senatorial seat.</p>\n\n<p>Gideon\nis also said to be plotting on how his strong men will take on Ruto\u2019s allies in\nBaringo. He is said to be grooming the suspended Assembly Speaker William\nKamket to take on the URP MP Asman Kamama. Kamket vied unsuccessfully for the\nTiaty parliamentary seat on a Kanu ticket but lost to URP\u2019s Asman Kamama.</p>\n\n<p>Another\nconcern of Uhuru and by extension other top Kalenjin politicians and\nprofessionals is whether Ruto can succeed Uhuru in 2022 without Moi\u2019s blessings.</p>\n\n<p>A\nstory is told that after the Ravine Declaration of 2006 where Ruto declared his\ncandidature for presidency he and his entourage drove to Moi\u2019s Kabarak home to\nseek blessings. It is alleged that Moi didn\u2019t open the gate for them for he\nknew Ruto was not up to the task. Todate Moi has never changed his mind.</p>\n\n<p>Last\nweek, Moi has dismissed reports alleging he met with Uhuru and Ruto at State\nHouse Nairobi. This happened at a time when Ruto claimed that his political\nrivals led by Gideon and Ruto were rejoicing about his ICC tribulations.</p>\n\n<p>Those\nwho have been following the Kalenjin politics as they unfold will agree that Gideon\nhas identified Ruto\u2019s weaknesses in government and has been using them to\nattack the DP during his countrywide meet-the-people tours on the DP\u2019s home\nturf.</p>\n\n<p>The\nissues include claims that the DP has been reluctant to bring pressure to bear\nfor better pricing of maize in the North Rift and tea prices in the South Rift,\nas well as his lack of steam to push for a whole raft of pre-election campaign\npledges to the region.</p>\n\n<p>It\nis now said that for Uhuru to reconcile the two families, he must also reach\nout to individuals from within the Baringo County. Names that are being flouted\nthat could see the deal brokered successfully includes those of Benjamin Cheboi\n(Baringo governor), Joshua Kulei (former President Moi\u2019s private secretary), Daniel\nKibelion who is a prominent businessman and the proprietor of the Kibelion\nHotel in Emining a popular tourist destination and Asman Kamama (MP for Tiaty).</p>\n\n<p>Others\nare Moses Lessonet (Eldama Ravine), William Cheptumo (Baringo North), Prof\nHellen Sambili, Sammy Mwaita (Baringo Central), Grace Kiptui (Baringo County\nWomen\u2019s Representative), Grace Kipchoim (Baringo South), Musa Sirma, Leut Gen\nJoseph Kasaon, Rtd Gen Daudi Tonje, Phyllis Kandie (Cabinet Secretary for East\nAfrican Affairs, Commerce and Tourism), Amb Lucy Chelimo, Prof James Tuitoek, Alicen\nChelaite, Eric Kotut who is the former Central Bank governor and is one of the\nkey businessmen in Baringo who has invested heavily in the flower sector and Dr.\nEdward Sambili.</p>\n\n<p>But\neven Uhuru seems to be willing to work with Ruto and his allies in 2017 and\neven beyond, Ruto allies are not comfortable with Uhuru\u2019s close links with\nGideon and the Moi family. Uhuru\u2019s strageists are said to have advised him to\ngroom Gideon should the ICC jail Ruto or should Ruto decide to run against him\nin 2017.</p>\n\n<p>To\nshow how close Uhuru and Gideon are and to begin with, the Mois and the\nKenyattas have a long history and an interesting future that is already\nunfolding in the ongoing power struggle.</p>\n\n<p>Gideon\nhas accompanied Uhuru to Sudan and AU summits in Ethiopia as well as to the\nbillionaire playgrounds of Dubai to watch the elitist Formula One motor racing\nsport.

Although he did not name names, the blame seemed to have been directed at Cord and its leadership under the tutelage of Raila.\n\nScene two of the unfolding blame games on the deteriorating security saw state intelligence and spy agencies through the Internal Security cabinet secretary Joseph Ole Lenku at it again and this time, he named ODM and Cord leaders as the sponsors of terror groups in the country. At one time, he accused Cord of using the dreaded Mungiki adherents to cause mayhem at the coast.\n\nDeputy president Wiliam Ruto has also linked the attacks and insecurity to ODM.\n\nBut the big question now is whether Raila and by extension Cord, operate a private army. Sources say there is a feeling within government circles that Raila could be having ties with criminal elements who have been unleashing terror on Kenyans.\n\nOn Its part, the opposition has denied the claims and dismissed them as propaganda to divert Kenyans from the burning security issue, corruption and bad governance.\n\nThat panic and fear have gripped the establishment and it is out to do all at its disposal to control the escalating insecurity being linked to Raila is no secret. Last week, MPs shot down a motion that if passed could have allowed the National Intelligence Service to hack into phone calls, Sms and e-mails without having to seek approval of the court. Sources say it was part of the state\u2019s calculation to monitor closely Cord leaders\u2019 communications and to ascertain if indeed they are behind the attacks as intelligence reports had claimed.\n\nThe government, according to sources, has come out in full force to ensure Cord does not destabilise the Jubilee administration and it is against this background that Cord leaders have now been put on 24-hour surveillance.\n\nThe fear and suspicion within the government security apparatus is that Raila could be having a complete intelligence gathering unit is as a result of his former position as prime minister. The fear is that when he was a co-principal in the coalition government with President Mwai Kibaki, he used to have intelligence briefings on a daily basis.\n\nTo show how the government is not taking lightly the security threats, of late President Uhuru Kenyatta has beefed up his security detail including using bombproof cars. His deputy William Ruto\u2019s security has also been beefed up as well as that of top government officials in sensitive positions like Internal Security and his principal secretary.\n\nAccording to sources, there is fear that Raila could still be getting state briefings from intelligence officers who are loyal to ODM and Cord and that he could be accessing sensitive information which he then uses to take Jubilee head on during public rallies. During a Cord rally at Tononoka in Mombasa, two members of the armed forces found themselves in trouble for attending the meeting.\n\nThey were spotted by members of the dreaded military intelligence who were assigned to give briefs on the events. That military intelligence is being used to monitor the opposition shows how serious the government is on the opposition plans. In his book, The Enigma, Raila says soldiers who were to later stage a coup in 1982 used football game halftime breaks to spread his word. In the middle of the pitch, soldiers had no fear at all that they were being listened to.\n\nThey would also compare notes as they played. This, as spectators were meant to believe it was an innocent game of soccer. The coup was however mercilessly crushed after the soldiers instead of minding the business at hand that of overthrowing Moi, entered bars and drunk silly. Raila himself had to flee dressed as a Legio Maria bishop to Uganda. Although in the book he says he fooled the police with the dress, sources close to intelligence at the time say that they were fully aware it was Raila in disguise and even asked Moi whether they could blow the boat Raila was fleeing in Lake Victoria on to which Moi after entering a private room came back and told them to let Raila flee so that he can live to see others become president.\n\nOld habits, they say, never die. Could the ageing horse be up to new tricks?\n\nJust recently, security agencies were shocked when Raila, Kalonzo Musyoka and Moses Wetang\u2019ula displayed a letter that was supposedly written by the chief of staff and head of public service Joseph Kinyua seeking advisory opinion on possible arrest of Raila and Cord leaders, and the possibility of them being charged with treason.\n\nHow this supposed sensitive and confidential letter landed into the hands of Cord leaders remains a mystery. Some have concluded that Raila has infiltrated the spy and security agencies who feed him with crucial information.\n\nAnother worry is that Kalonzo could also be having people loyal to him within the state security and spy agency. Just like Raila, during his tenure as VP, he also used to get state briefings on a daily basis and it is feared that he could also be accessing sensitive information.\n\nCord has been claiming members of the armed forces from communities that are perceived to be Cord are being targeted. Cases of opposition having private armies are not a new phenomenon in Africa. In South Africa, the ANC had a private army (Umkhonto we Sizwe), spear of the nation, which helped the country gain independence and was retained even after ANC won the elections.\n\nSources say that Raila enjoys cordial relationship with South Africa and its feared he must have borrowed a leaf from them over having a private army and a parallel intelligence agency.\n\nRaila is a well known ally of South African business tycoon Cyril Ramaphosa who is ANC second in command and seen as South Africa\u2019s next president. Sources say Raila received great financial backing from him during the 2007 and 2013 elections. He is the man set to succeed Jacob zuma.\n\nIt has also been whispered that he was the man behind the private jet Raila bought from South Africa. What is not known however, is whether he contributed and how much if he did. During the post-election violence of 2007, Ramaphosa was rejected by the Kibaki side of being a Raila sympathiser.\n\nTo show how close Raila and Ramaphosa are, after losing the 2013 presidential elections, Raila, Kalonzo and Wetang\u2019ula were hosted by Ramaphosa the same day Uhuru and Ruto were being sworn in office. The Raila-Ramaphosa link is also being monitored to detect any involvement in recent killings in Kenya.\n\nCord on the other hand has dismissed any links with the terror group Al-Shabaab saying the government is relying on propaganda information to intimidate the opposition.\n\nLast week, Jubilee majority leader in parliament Aden Duale made a sensational claim that Cord and al-Shabaab were reading from the same script. The statement caused ripples as Jubilee and Cord members engaged in verbal exchanges which at some point degenerated into insults in parliament.\n\nBut even as Jubilee closely monitors Cord leaders\u2019 daily movement and with Raila and Kalonzo complaining that their phones are being tapped, Cord has dismissed claims that they are planning to destabilise the Uhuru government and blames it on hearsay and high level propaganda.\n\nCord leadership and more so, Coast leaders, are now blaming the Mombasa county commissioner Nelson Marwa as being used by the government to intimidate and paint Cord supporters and its leaders negatively.\n\nLast week, he linked the recent Likoni gun attack that killed four people to ODM. According to Marwa, ODM operatives in Mombasa are sponsoring youth in Likoni and other places to cause chaos and mayhem so that the blame can go to the government.\n\nCord has however, in many occasions, dared the state security agencies to arrest them and charge them if they have evidence but Marwa has failed to specify who in particular among the Cord leaders was giving up to Sh3,000 to youth to cause mayhem. He instead stated that they have narrowed down the search to two powerful individuals in Mombasa county. According to Marwa, ODM has been inciting people on matters of land and referendum to turn citizens against the government.\n\nLast week, Ole Lenku claimed that ODM has been duping its supporters to sign the referendum form promising them that they will be allocated land. ODM has however termed it as cheap propaganda saying that the allegations are not new, but are a show of lack of awareness by the county commissioner.\n\n\u201cThe outburst by the so-called county commissioner in Mombasa Marwa associating the Orange Democratic Movement with terrorism is nothing new. It falls within the pattern of innuendo, slander and disinformation about the Coalition for Reforms and Democracy that Jubilee has engaged in consistently to divert attention from their incompetence in dealing with insecurity in the country,\u201d Anyang\u2019 Nyongo said. He added that Kenyans will not be fooled by \u201cthis ill-intentioned baboonery\u201d.\n\nWhen Marwa said that they are investigating two senior politicians from the region, fingers were being pointed at Mombasa Governor Hassan Joho and Mombasa Senator Hassan Omar. Jubilee leaders have not forgiven Joho for being disrespectful to President Uhuru. This is in reference to an alleged speech in which Joho called the president \u2018small person\u2019 during iftar dinner hosted for Raila in Mombasa last week just as he did to Marwa.\n\nJoho is reported to have said that he is not threatened by the county commissioner Nelson Marwa who is \u2018a small person\u2019 and even his employer is \u2018a very small person\u2019. Joho did not, however, name President Uhuru Kenyatta as that small person but many have claimed his statement was directed at Uhuru.\n\nThose who say there is a serious security threat cite Uhuru\u2019s new security measures. During the June 1 2014 Madaraka Day celebrations, Uhuru made his way into the Nyayo Stadium not on the customary ceremonial Land Rover but a Toyota Land Cruiser with bullet proof glass shielding. Part of his convoy was an armoured Reconnaissance Command Vehicle.\n\nThe RCV Survivor I is an 8-tonne class all-terrain, high mobility, lightweight, 4\u00d74 modular armoured vehicle manufactured by Austrian company, Achleitner for military customers.\n\nThe vehicle design focuses on modular add-on protection against ballistic threats, mines, artillery splinters and improvised explosive devices. It is powered by a 286-hp diesel engine developing a top speed of 100 kilometres per hour on road.\n\nThe vehicle is based on an armoured steel monocoque cell with composite add-ons that provide its occupants (two crew members plus a maximum of five dismounts) with Level 2 ballistic and Level 2a/b mine protection. It also has a deflecting floor and floating seats though IED protection level remains undisclosed.\n\nRCV Survivor I 4\u00d74 features Stanag 4569 level protection with modular add-on armour kits providing Level 3 protection against bombardment and Level 2a/2b against mines and IEDs.\n\nThe RCV Survivor is available in communication, border patrol, reconnaissance, command vehicle and ambulance. For law enforcement, military and security range customers the Survivor is available in two additional versions called Survivor I 4\u00d74 Basic and Survivor I 4\u00d74 Light.\n\nThe Survivor 4\u00d74 Basic has a gross vehicle weight of 5,000 kg and is intended for police, military and paramilitary customers. The Survivor 4\u00d74 Light is a special purpose militarised version with a gross vehicle weight of 3,250 kg and a 173-hp diesel engine. Two Survivor I vehicles can be airlifted by a single C-130 or C-160 transport aircraft.\n\nThe Survivor I RCV is powered by a 250 hp VM diesel engine, that provides a power-to-weight ratio of over 33 hp/tonne. It is coupled to an Allison automatic transmission with three 100pc differential locks and a permanent four-wheel drive traction. The vehicle is fitted with live axles front and rear and with 335/80 R20 run-flat tyres.\n\nIts maximum road speed is around 100 km/h while its cruise range is given as 800 km. The vehicle, which is available in three- or five-door configurations, is outfitted not only for communication equipment and other auxiliary systems, but also for a remote-control weapon station on the roof.", "articleBodyHtml": "<article>\n\n<p>Controversial\nstatements and political views are emanating from various government security\nagencies over the rising cases of insecurity in Kenya and more so, in Coast\nregion which has left many speculating with an accusing finger being pointed at\nODM and Cord leader Raila Odinga.</p>\n\n<figure><a href=\"http://3.bp.blogspot.com/-NP7clyccjho/U9X1ROgcZLI/AAAAAAAAAp0/Ticu8rwbSw0/s1600/ARMY.jpg\"><img src=\"http://3.bp.blogspot.com/-NP7clyccjho/U9X1ROgcZLI/AAAAAAAAAp0/Ticu8rwbSw0/s1600/ARMY.jpg\"></a></figure>\n\n<p>Implicating\nRaila has left many analysts coming up with different theories.</p>\n\n<p>It\nall began at State House, Nairobi, in the first scene when President Uhuru\nKenyatta fired the first salvo during a live TV broadcast hours after the\nbloody Mpeketoni attack saying the raid was politically instigated through\nlocal political networks.

Sources say there is a feeling within government circles that Raila could\nbe having ties with criminal elements who have been unleashing terror on\nKenyans.</p>\n\n<p>On\nIts part, the opposition has denied the claims and dismissed them as propaganda\nto divert Kenyans from the burning security issue, corruption and bad\ngovernance.</p>\n\n<figure><a href=\"http://2.bp.blogspot.com/-YznuIK_75Sk/U9X2nG3DTSI/AAAAAAAAAqI/rzFPq-7FSOM/s1600/RUTT.jpg\"><img src=\"http://2.bp.blogspot.com/-YznuIK_75Sk/U9X2nG3DTSI/AAAAAAAAAqI/rzFPq-7FSOM/s1600/RUTT.jpg\"></a></figure>\n\n<p>That\npanic and fear have gripped the establishment and it is out to do all at its\ndisposal to control the escalating insecurity being linked to Raila is no\nsecret. Last week, MPs shot down a motion that if passed could have allowed the\nNational Intelligence Service to hack into phone calls, Sms and e-mails without\nhaving to seek approval of the court. Sources say it was part of the state\u2019s\ncalculation to monitor closely Cord leaders\u2019 communications and to ascertain if\nindeed they are behind the attacks as intelligence reports had claimed.</p>\n\n<p>The\ngovernment, according to sources, has come out in full force to ensure Cord\ndoes not destabilise the Jubilee administration and it is against this\nbackground that Cord leaders have now been put on 24-hour surveillance.</p>\n\n<p>The\nfear and suspicion within the government security apparatus is that Raila could\nbe having a complete intelligence gathering unit is as a result of his former\nposition as prime minister. The fear is that when he was a co-principal in the\ncoalition government with President Mwai Kibaki, he used to have intelligence\nbriefings on a daily basis.</p>\n\n<figure><a href=\"http://2.bp.blogspot.com/-3U1u4efYzoo/U9X2wmRa1SI/AAAAAAAAAqQ/oKUweBwG3zs/s1600/KALL.jpg\"><img src=\"http://2.bp.blogspot.com/-3U1u4efYzoo/U9X2wmRa1SI/AAAAAAAAAqQ/oKUweBwG3zs/s1600/KALL.jpg\"></a></figure>\n\n<figure><a href=\"http://4.bp.blogspot.com/-u5DLU3UlWMs/U9X22ys6BpI/AAAAAAAAAqY/VFQFOW6jXus/s1600/KALL.jpg\"><img src=\"http://4.bp.blogspot.com/-u5DLU3UlWMs/U9X22ys6BpI/AAAAAAAAAqY/VFQFOW6jXus/s1600/KALL.jpg\"></a></figure>\n\n<p>To\nshow how the government is not taking lightly the security threats, of late President\nUhuru Kenyatta has beefed up his security detail including using bombproof\ncars. His deputy William Ruto\u2019s security has also been beefed up as well as\nthat of top government officials in sensitive positions like Internal Security\nand his principal secretary.</p>\n\n<p>According\nto sources, there is fear that Raila could still be getting state briefings\nfrom intelligence officers who are loyal to ODM and Cord and that he could be\naccessing sensitive information which he then uses to take Jubilee head on\nduring public rallies. During a Cord rally at Tononoka in Mombasa, two members\nof the armed forces found themselves in trouble for attending the meeting.</p>\n\n<p>They\nwere spotted by members of the dreaded military intelligence who were assigned\nto give briefs on the events. That military intelligence is being used to\nmonitor the opposition shows how serious the government is on the opposition\nplans. In his book, The Enigma, Raila says soldiers who were to later stage a\ncoup in 1982 used football game halftime breaks to spread his word. In the\nmiddle of the pitch, soldiers had no fear at all that they were being listened\nto.</p>\n\n<figure><a href=\"http://1.bp.blogspot.com/-sLfsLZ0mMvU/U9X3C7YcgzI/AAAAAAAAAqg/puuBp_ax3aE/s1600/WETT.jpg\"><img src=\"http://1.bp.blogspot.com/-sLfsLZ0mMvU/U9X3C7YcgzI/AAAAAAAAAqg/puuBp_ax3aE/s1600/WETT.jpg\"></a></figure>\n\n<p>They\nwould also compare notes as they played. This, as spectators were meant to\nbelieve it was an innocent game of soccer. The coup was however mercilessly\ncrushed after the soldiers instead of minding the business at hand that of\noverthrowing Moi, entered bars and drunk silly. Raila himself had to flee\ndressed as a Legio Maria bishop to Uganda. Although in the book he says he\nfooled the police with the dress, sources close to intelligence at the time say\nthat they were fully aware it was Raila in disguise and even asked Moi whether\nthey could blow the boat Raila was fleeing in Lake Victoria on to which Moi\nafter entering a private room came back and told them to let Raila flee so that\nhe can live to see others become president.</p>\n\n<figure><a href=\"http://2.bp.blogspot.com/-_MtfjCYqgx4/U9X3V5ju27I/AAAAAAAAAqo/6Ex1YHm2LX4/s1600/RAMA.jpg\"><img src=\"http://2.bp.blogspot.com/-_MtfjCYqgx4/U9X3V5ju27I/AAAAAAAAAqo/6Ex1YHm2LX4/s1600/RAMA.jpg\"></a></figure>\n\n<p>Old\nhabits, they say, never die. Could the ageing horse be up to new tricks?</p>\n\n<p>Just\nrecently, security agencies were shocked when Raila, Kalonzo Musyoka and Moses\nWetang\u2019ula displayed a letter that was supposedly written by the chief of staff\nand head of public service Joseph Kinyua seeking advisory opinion on possible\narrest of Raila and Cord leaders, and the possibility of them being charged\nwith treason.</p>\n\n<p>How\nthis supposed sensitive and confidential letter landed into the hands of Cord\nleaders remains a mystery. Some have concluded that Raila has infiltrated the\nspy and security agencies who feed him with\u00a0\ncrucial information.</p>\n\n<p>Another\nworry is that Kalonzo could also be having people loyal to him within the state\nsecurity and spy agency. Just like Raila, during his tenure as VP, he also used\nto get state briefings on a daily basis and it is feared that he could also be\naccessing sensitive information.</p>\n\n<p>Cord\nhas been claiming members of the armed forces from communities that are\nperceived to be Cord are being targeted. Cases of opposition having private\narmies are not a new phenomenon in Africa.

He is the man set to succeed Jacob zuma.</p>\n\n<p>It has also been whispered that he was the man\nbehind the private jet Raila bought from South Africa. What is not known\nhowever, is whether he contributed and how much if he did. During the\npost-election violence of 2007, Ramaphosa was rejected by the Kibaki side of\nbeing a Raila sympathiser.</p>\n\n<p>To\nshow how close Raila and Ramaphosa are, after losing the 2013 presidential\nelections, Raila, Kalonzo and Wetang\u2019ula were hosted by Ramaphosa the same day\nUhuru and Ruto were being sworn in office. The Raila-Ramaphosa link is also\nbeing monitored to detect any involvement in recent killings in Kenya.</p>\n\n<p>Cord\non the other hand has dismissed any links with the terror group Al-Shabaab\nsaying the government is relying on propaganda information to intimidate the\nopposition.</p>\n\n<p>Last\nweek, Jubilee majority leader in parliament Aden Duale made a sensational claim\nthat Cord and al-Shabaab were reading from the same script.

The two seats of VIPs were separated by a red-carpeted aisle.\n\nProtocol number two was that Raila would not talk politics.\n\nAlso planned far in advance were the president\u2019s own words and the flavour of his remarks. Kenyatta told Raila that he was ready to work with him. Analysts instantly interpreted this to mean that it was extending an olive branch and reaching out to Raila to broker peace.\n\nSaid Uhuru: \u201cI can see my brother Raila here and I can assure him that I have no problem. I look forward to working with him and I believe that is what the Kenyan people want of us: To pull together like past leaders.\u201d\n\nBut Raila, who spoke before the president, made history for the first time in his life by not talking politics when given the chance to speak at the funeral service. Instead, he gave Mungai what appeared to be a heartfelt eulogy. Raila\u2019s praises of one of the founding powerbrokers of modern Kenya, a man who played the power game with ruthlessness, cunning and divide-and-rule schemes stunned many Kenyans.\n\nMungai was one of the founding Vice President Jaramogi Oginga Odinga\u2019s biggest political enemies and one of the three principals tasked to frustrate the elder Odinga\u2019s political wing \u2013 the Kenya People\u2019s Union \u2013 the country\u2019s first post-independence political party between 1966, when it was founded, and 1969, when it was proscribed.\n\nBut Raila eulogised Mungai as a giant of the independence struggle, champion of education for Kenyans and post-independence entrepreneurship.\n\nThese were the amazing scenes to those who could remember the huge struggle between Mungai and Kanu founder secretary general, Tom Mboya on one side (the first government) and Odinga and Bildad Kaggia of Murang\u2019a in the opposition.\n\nAlso intriguing were Kibaki\u2019s remarks, when he, like Raila, spoke before Uhuru. Kibaki told both the president and the former PM: \u201cThere is too much quarrelling between ourselves but let us respect the life of Dr Mungai by making Kenya prosperous because fighting among yourselves, you will not achieve much by quarrelling\u201d. Mungai and Kibaki were in different camps during the Kenyatta succession era. These were not random, off-the-cuff remarks made for the moment either.\n\nPerceptive observers have started to see that there was more than meets the eye, or ear, at Mungai\u2019s funeral service. The funeral of one of the foremost operatives, who engineered the post-independence, falling-out between the Kikuyu and the Luo that has lasted for more than 50 years was interesting for it happened at a time when a second Odinga is leading the opposition and giving a second Kenyatta who is again at State House sleepless nights.\n\nThe impression behind-the-scenes of those caucusing between friends and networkers of all three sides, the retired President\u2019s and the incumbent\u2019s and of relatives, friends and strategists of Raila\u2019s is indeed overwhelming.\n\nSomething is happening somewhere far behind the scenes and it is major.\n\nA day later at another venue and occasion, Uhuru again reached out to Raila. This time it was at the official opening of the Huduma Centre in Mombasa. The president for the second time urged Raila to join hands with the government to deliver services.\n\nHe said party affiliation and religious beliefs should not divide Kenyans adding that if there is a problem, leaders should sit at a round table and dialogue. He told the people of the Coast, a region that voted overwhelmingly for Raila at the March 4 2013 presidential poll, that politics should not cause enmity between them.\n\nThis time, the president spoke explicitly of the Cord referendum campaign, saying \u201cMimi na Tinga hatuna shida\u201d. I am telling him to continue with his referendum dance while I carry on with my development dance. He can meet the people; tell them his agenda and go back home. Kenyans have a right to listen to him and make their own independent decision\u201d.\n\nHowever, in a live interview on TV, Raila expressed uncertainty over whether Uhuru\u2019s entreaties could stand the test of time.\n\nRaila also addressed another moot issue on TV, a proposed constitutional amendment locking out candidates aged 65 years old and over from joining future presidential races. In his usual fashion of playing to his excitable core constituencies, Raila, who will be 72 in 2017, declared that nothing would shut him out of the race. If he is indeed able to vie, Raila will be participating in the fourth presidential race of his political career and the third consecutive one.\n\nThe president does not want a referendum timed on the midpoint of his first term and Raila very badly wants to gather momentum and traction for 2017, the last great battle of his life whatever happens thereafter. Both men have a lot to gain, the president, a second term that secures his legacy and Raila at least, a first term if he finally wins that crowns his long time desire to occupy the throne. Both men also have everything to lose if they play their cards wrong.\n\nSitting between them is Deputy President William Ruto, a man who for now cannot stand Raila. The sentiment is mutual, because the only way Raila would ever work with Ruto again is if he was not only his senior but also his superior.\n\nThe impending end of Uhuru\u2019s case at the ICC could bring about dramatic new changes in his demeanour, actions, outreach, networking and partnering. It is being quietly said that a new Uhuru with new priorities could emerge if the prosecution case at The Hague collapses.\n\nThe most frequent comparison being made is to President Daniel arap Moi after the August 1 1982, coup attempt by disgruntled members of the Kenya Air Force. Raila and his father were deeply involved in that attempt. The coup attempt saw a rejuvenated Moi who dramatically changed his modus operandi.\n\nAlso watching the scene carefully is DP Ruto, who has his own case at the ICC. If both the Kenyan cases at the ICC involving members of the presidency collapse, dramatic new things could begin happening in Kenya. There are three key prospective scenarios \u2013 either Uhuru and Ruto bond even more, politically speaking, after the disappearance of the ICC cases, or the two begin behaving as if The Hague factor was the superglue or waterproof cement that had held them together all along and without it, they will pursue separate agendas for 2017.\n\nThe third scenario is the president\u2019s case collapsing without, effectively, ever having started, but the DP\u2019s takes more time to resolve, in which case Uhuru begins revising his 2017 options.\n\nPolitical strategists and handlers on all sides and their networks in the corporate and diplomatic sectors are keenly aware of all these metrics and are scrutinising every move.\n\nIn the matter of Uhuru reaching out to Raila twice in one week, in Kiambu and in Mombasa, it is clear that he is taking the advice of a number of Kikuyu tycoons who believe that the safest way to protect and grow investment in the long run is to defuse political tensions and long-term enmities.\n\nKenya is on the threshold of economic take-off with the continuing discovery of hydrocarbon national resources, the Lapsset project and a growing middle class in all regions. The classic Kenyan political template of Kenyatta versus Odinga and Odinga versus Kenyatta may have suited the country before the prosperity take-off but now it looks increasingly like an impediment not an enabler of the prosperity agenda.\n\nThose who are about to graduate from being Kenyan shilling billionaires to achieving trillionaire status do not want the Kenyan national boat rocked by old school political rivalry.\n\nAmong the older people pushing Uhuru to find a working formula with Raila without either of them losing face (Kenyatta as incumbent President and Odinga to his highly expectant extended Cord political constituency) is Charles Njonjo, aged 94, but still going strong, and Stanley Githunguri, 74, both of whom did very well for themselves under the late Mzee Jomo Kenyatta and Joe Wanjui, a former chancellor of Nairobi university and a man of means who is also involved.\n\nYounger but still substantial Kikuyu tycoons who would like to see the dangerous Kikuyu-Luo divide sealed once and for all and the coming prosperity boom shared in a more enlightened manner than was the case before the discovery of natural resources everywhere include Equity Bank Group managing director James Mwangi and Royal Media Services proprietor SK Macharia. Njonjo and Githunguri have also had banking interests and investments in their long careers.\n\nAmong the young shakers and movers with an eye fixed firmly on the coming age of a multi-trillion-shilling national budget and countless opportunities in the counties is businessman Jimmy Wanjigi. He moves seamlessly between Raila and Uhuru.\n\nIn Raila\u2019s innermost inner circle, his elder brother Oburu Odinga, who worked with Uhuru when the latter was minister at the Treasury, is perceived as pushing for a rapprochement with the incumbent president. Raila\u2019s cousin Jakoyo Midiwo is in the game. In parliament, Midiwo was reconciliatory when addressing referendum talks.\n\nAccording to Midiwo, Raila and Kibaki were in agreement during the campaigns for the 2010 referendum that 20pc of the constitution was faulty and that it would be finetuned once it was passed. If only MPs could become sober, Midiwo said as he presented one of his most lucid arguments ever in parliament, there would be no need for a referendum as then the amendments could be done on the floor.\n\nWhen Midiwo talks on certain matters, some say, it is Raila\u2019s voice coming out through Midiwo\u2019s mouth. Could it be that it Raila had on this occasion borrowed Midiwo\u2019s mouth? The answer, Kenyans will not have to wait for long.\n\nAlso being reached out to influence the truce is Raila\u2019s spiritual adviser, self-proclaimed Prophet Edward Owuor. Raila is said to have a lot of respect for the \u2018prophet\u2019 who baptised him ahead of his third stab at the presidency.\n\nThe president\u2019s side would do anything not to be engaged in a referendum scenario where victory is not assured. Raila\u2019s side would do anything to remain relevant, but it is not certain that they can backtrack on the referendum without losing credibility big time and opening the path for a new generation of opposition leaders that would shunt them aside and then fail miserably to deliver the kind of voter numbers that Raila has delivered in two consecutive presidential polls, 2007 and 2013 \u2013 almost 10 million combined.", "articleBodyHtml": "<article>\n\n<p>President\nUhuru Kenyatta and Raila Amolo Odinga\u2019s encounter at the funeral service of the\nlate Njoroge Mungai was not a random or unplanned event.</p>\n\n<p>A\ngreat deal of networking on both sides had gone into the works, resulting in\nthe dramatic face to face encounter as strictest protocol norms were agreed\nwell in advance far behind tightly closed doors in the corridors of power as a\nnumber of elites came into play.</p>\n\n<figure><a href=\"http://1.bp.blogspot.com/-qN56DxDpqT8/VAQRdpNn8pI/AAAAAAAABZw/neyA38Jo9u0/s1600/1.jpg\"><img src=\"http://1.bp.blogspot.com/-qN56DxDpqT8/VAQRdpNn8pI/AAAAAAAABZw/neyA38Jo9u0/s1600/1.jpg\"></a></figure>\n\n<p>Protocol\nnumber one was the seating arrangements in the VIP section at the PCEA Church\nof the Torch at Thogoto, Kikuyu, Kiambu county.</p>\n\n<p>Raila\nwould not be seated next to Uhuru and First Lady Margaret but between former\nFirst Lady Mama Ngina Kenyatta and former President Mwai Kibaki.

It is suspected that she uses the car and at the same time withdraws car allowance unlike her deputies who are using their own vehicles after it was agreed that they draw allowances.\n\nAlso under investigations is the procurement of the university bus at a cost of Sh11m but which sources say was initially to be purchased at Sh9million. Sources say the procurement of the bus did not follow the right procedure. Already, the university\u2019s tender committee is under pressure to approve procurement of a certain finance system (Enterprise Resource Planning System) at a cost of Sh20million.\n\nThe NICIC officers are said to be investigating claims of irregular hiring, promotion and firing of university staff. Of interest is one Mr Omuse who is a computer technician. Sources said in the last two years, Omuse has been promoted two times and is now in grade 12. Those who know him well say that his academic and professional qualifications do not allow him to be in grade 12.\n\nThe EACC is also said to be investigating circumstances under which Omuse took Sh990,000 in cash to pay for subscription by university to Africa association of universities and others. This money was allegedly approved by the VC and up to date, this money has never been accounted for.\n\nIt is claimed that the VC has gone tribal and creates positions for people from her ethnic community or to people who are loyal to her and who never raises queries on issues and directives and orders by the VC. The NCIC is also said to be investigating claims that most heads, chairmen and directors are appointed on tribal basis as close to 80 pc are from same ethnic community.\n\nAlready, word is out that some of her trusted and loyal lieutenants who have reached retirement age are still being retained. The officers who are said to have reached retirement age but are still in payroll are security officer, human resource officer and registrar academic affairs.\n\nSources say the VC has been single handedly appointing temporary staff while retrenching casuals who have worked for the university for many years on continuous basis. The VC allegedly employed Prof Oyaro\u2019s wife unprocedurally. Oyaro is the dean of Science.\n\nThe EACC, according to well-placed sources, has also been called upon to investigate an allegation that the VC is plotting on how to clear Prof David Serem of a debt of Sh9million from the suspense account. Serem is a former Principal of Maasai Mara University. When the finance officer detected the plot, he objected and was sent on forced leave. It is suspected that the VC cleared Serem during the absence of the finance officer.\n\nOn mismanagement of university funds, the letter claims that she has been visiting all over the world and financing Chinese and French to visit Narok to see the so-called botanical garden and in all her visits, there has been no impact or returns which is a clear case of misuse of university funds.\n\nThe letter further claims that the VC goes to Nairobi on Thursdays and Fridays and the trips are fully financed by the university claiming she is on official duties but investigations have revealed that she travels to Nairobi to attend classes. She is currently doing MBA at the University of Nairobi.\n\nIt is claimed that the university looses close to Sh100,000 every week through the VC\u2019s office for security purposes. Sources say whenever she travels to Nairobi; she is accompanied by a bodyguard who is paid allowances which are made in cash.\n\nIt is alleged that in all her dealings, she does not append her signature on approved documents and only puts initials (VC and the date) and rather than signing and approving the original documents, she does it on photocopies of the same documents.\n\nThe letter further alleges that the VC has hired the services of one Makokha who is a former university employee to spy on the university staff and another from Safaricom to tap other staff phones. On political patronage, she is said to have been sending emissaries to William ole Ntimama in an effort to compromise him. Sources say the VC has now employed a close relative to Ntimama in an effort to silence him.\n\nOne of the projects under investigations is the Sh15billion hospital. Stakeholders are wondering what happened to the project and if there was money allocated, where did it go? It is imperative to note that no single project has been done at the university since her appointment despite taxpayers\u2019 money channeled to the university for the last two years amounting to Sh300 million for projects.\n\nThe EACC is also said to have been investigating claims that the University Council chairman Joseph Okumu who through the influence of the VC has become an executive chairman. Records indicate that he draws a monthly allowance of close to Sh350,000 per month. The EACC sleuths are said to be pursuing documents which shows that he draws Sh80,000 responsibility allowances instead of Sh25,000.\n\nSources say Okumu is now performing administrative activities on a daily basis in which he addresses all deans of schools and all heads of departments and also signs letters of appointments to staff. A good example is that he signed for Ogola to act as the dean school of education.\n\nSources say the VC is manipulating the chairman by all means by approving and giving him allowances and honoraria on a daily basis. The two also possess some issues together without the knowledge of the full council of the university.\n\nPart time lecturers at the Maasai Mara University are also bitterly complaining that they are never paid and are owed hundreds of thousands in unpaid salaries and allowances.\n\nAlso under investigations are circumstances under which the VC brought the Presbyterian University students to graduate at Maasai Mara University during the third graduation ceremony.\n\nTender scam at Athi Water Services Board\n\nOur Reporter\n\nWith barely two months before the Athi Water Services Board CEO Malequen Miulgo proceeds for terminal leave pending end of his contract in November, details of how he manipulates the tender committee in awarding multi-million tenders have emerged.\n\nAccording to sources from the tender committee, the CEO is a man obsessed with the big man syndrome and dictates on who gets what tender.\n\nA perfect example is the augmentation of the Tigoni water supply where 28 companies submitted their tenders among them Yarrow Construction, Machiri Ltd, Oriental Construction, New Age Developers, Tisco Construction among others.\n\nShockingly and by order of Miulgo, the tender was awarded to Flozziz Construction Ltd which had quoted Sh121,975,587 yet it was not the lowest bidder. Sources allege the directors of Flozziz Construction Ltd offered the CEO Sh2m.\n\nIn another tender for Athi Water Boreholes Phase II, 20 companies submitted their bids. Among the companies are Insta Pumps, Prime Rigs, Njuca Consolidated, Shanxi Geological among others where the lowest bidder was Turn-O-metal which had quoted Sh197m but it was awarded to Njuaca Consolidated. Sources alleged that the company\u2019s directed gave a Sh6m bribe.\n\nAnother tender is the Oloitoktok water supply and sanitation where 14 firms submitted their tenders namely Penelly Construction (Sh845,223,494), Lee Construction (Sh895,831,031), Vaghjigai Enterprises (Sh894,940,801), Byusuff and Sons Ltd (Sh875,555,937) and Unibee Construction (Sh679,738,830) among other tenderers. Sources again allege that the CEO was allegedly given Sh200m by Byusuff and Sons Ltd and was unprocedurally awarded the tender yet it was not the lowest bidder.\n\nTo block the disgruntled tenderers from filing complaints at the Public Procurement Oversight Authority, Miulgo withholds regret letters to the unsuccessful bidders after 21 days to technically knock them out from taking the case to the PPOA for review.

It is suspected that she uses the car and\nat the same time withdraws car allowance unlike her deputies who are using\ntheir own vehicles after it was agreed that they draw allowances.</p>\n\n<p>Also under investigations\nis the procurement of the university bus at a cost of Sh11m but which sources\nsay was initially to be purchased at Sh9million. Sources say the procurement of\nthe bus did not follow the right procedure. Already, the university\u2019s tender\ncommittee is under pressure to approve procurement of a certain finance system\n(Enterprise Resource Planning System) at a cost of Sh20million.</p>\n\n<p>The NICIC officers are\nsaid to be investigating claims of irregular hiring, promotion and firing of\nuniversity staff. Of interest is one Mr Omuse who is a computer technician.\nSources said in the last two years, Omuse has been promoted two times and is\nnow in grade 12. Those who know him well say that his academic and professional\nqualifications do not allow him to be in grade 12.</p>\n\n<p>The EACC is also said to\nbe investigating circumstances under which Omuse took Sh990,000 in cash to pay\nfor subscription by university to Africa association of universities and\nothers. This money was allegedly approved by the VC and up to date, this money\nhas never been accounted for.</p>\n\n<p>It is claimed that the VC\nhas gone tribal and creates positions for people from her ethnic community or\nto people who are loyal to her and who never raises queries on issues and\ndirectives and orders by the VC. The NCIC is also said to be investigating\nclaims that most heads, chairmen and directors are appointed on tribal\nbasis\u00a0 as close to 80 pc are from same\nethnic community.</p>\n\n<p>Already, word is out that\nsome of her trusted and loyal lieutenants who have reached retirement age are\nstill being retained. The officers who are said to have reached retirement age\nbut are still in payroll are security officer, human resource officer and\nregistrar academic affairs.</p>\n\n<p>Sources say the VC has\nbeen single handedly appointing temporary staff while retrenching casuals who\nhave worked for the university for many years on continuous basis. The VC\nallegedly employed Prof Oyaro\u2019s wife unprocedurally. Oyaro is the dean of\nScience.</p>\n\n<p>The EACC, according to\nwell-placed sources, has also been called upon to investigate an allegation\nthat the VC is plotting on how to clear Prof David Serem of a debt of\nSh9million from the suspense account. Serem is a former Principal of Maasai\nMara University. When the finance officer detected the plot, he objected and\nwas sent on forced leave. It is suspected that the VC cleared Serem during the\nabsence of the finance officer.</p>\n\n<p>On mismanagement of\nuniversity funds, the letter claims that she has been visiting all over the\nworld and financing Chinese and French to visit Narok to see the so-called\nbotanical garden and in all her visits, there has been no impact or\nreturns\u00a0 which is a clear case of misuse\nof university funds.</p>\n\n<p>The letter further claims\nthat the VC goes to Nairobi on Thursdays and Fridays and the trips are fully\nfinanced by the university claiming she is on official duties but\ninvestigations have revealed that she travels to Nairobi to attend classes. She\nis currently doing MBA at the University of Nairobi.</p>\n\n<p>It is claimed that the\nuniversity looses close to Sh100,000 every week through the VC\u2019s office for\nsecurity purposes. Sources say whenever she travels to Nairobi; she is\naccompanied by a bodyguard who is paid allowances which are made in cash.</p>\n\n<p>It is alleged that in all\nher dealings, she does not append her signature on approved documents and only\nputs initials (VC and the date) and rather than signing and approving the\noriginal documents, she does it on photocopies of the same documents.</p>\n\n<p>The letter further\nalleges that the VC has hired the services of one Makokha who is a former\nuniversity employee to spy on the university staff and another from Safaricom\nto tap other staff phones. On political patronage, she is said to have been\nsending emissaries to William ole Ntimama in an effort to compromise him.\nSources say the VC has now employed a close relative to Ntimama in an effort to\nsilence him.</p>\n\n<p>One of the projects under\ninvestigations is the Sh15billion hospital. Stakeholders are wondering what\nhappened to the project and if there was money allocated, where did it go? It\nis imperative to note that no single project has been done at the university\nsince her appointment despite taxpayers\u2019 money channeled to the university for\nthe last two years amounting to Sh300 million for projects.</p>\n\n<p>The EACC is also said to\nhave been investigating claims that the University Council chairman Joseph\nOkumu who through the influence of the VC has become an executive chairman.\nRecords indicate that he draws a monthly allowance of close to Sh350,000 per\nmonth. The EACC sleuths are said to be pursuing documents which shows that he\ndraws Sh80,000 responsibility allowances instead of Sh25,000.</p>\n\n<p>Sources say Okumu is now\nperforming administrative activities on a daily basis in which he addresses all\ndeans of schools and all heads of departments and also signs letters of\nappointments to staff. A good example is that he signed for Ogola to act as the\ndean school of education.</p>\n\n<p>Sources say the VC is\nmanipulating the chairman by all means by approving and giving him allowances\nand honoraria on a daily basis. The two also possess some issues together\nwithout the knowledge of the full council of the university.</p>\n\n<p>Part time lecturers at\nthe Maasai Mara University are also bitterly complaining that they are never\npaid and are owed hundreds of thousands in unpaid salaries and allowances.</p>\n\n<p>Also under investigations\nare circumstances under which the VC brought the Presbyterian University students\nto graduate at Maasai Mara University during the third graduation ceremony.</p>\n\n<h2><a href=\"http://weeklycitizennewspaper.blogspot.com/2016/02/tender-scam-at-athi-water-services-board.html\">Tender scam at Athi Water Services Board</a></h2>\n\n<p><strong>Our Reporter</strong></p>\n\n<p>With barely two months before the Athi Water\nServices Board CEO Malequen Miulgo proceeds for terminal leave pending end of\nhis contract in November, details of how he manipulates the tender committee in\nawarding multi-million tenders have emerged.</p>\n\n<p>According to sources from\nthe tender committee, the CEO is a man obsessed with the big man syndrome and\ndictates on who gets what tender.</p>\n\n<p>A perfect example is the\naugmentation of the Tigoni water supply where 28 companies submitted their\ntenders among them Yarrow Construction, Machiri Ltd, Oriental Construction, New\nAge Developers, Tisco Construction among others.</p>\n\n<p>Shockingly and by order\nof Miulgo, the tender was awarded to Flozziz Construction Ltd which had quoted\nSh121,975,587 yet it was not the lowest bidder.

Among the\ncompanies are Insta Pumps, Prime Rigs, Njuca Consolidated, Shanxi Geological\namong others where the lowest bidder was Turn-O-metal which had quoted Sh197m\nbut it was awarded to Njuaca Consolidated. Sources alleged that the company\u2019s\ndirected gave a Sh6m bribe.</p>\n\n<p>Another tender is the\nOloitoktok water supply and sanitation where 14 firms submitted their tenders\nnamely Penelly Construction (Sh845,223,494), Lee Construction (Sh895,831,031),\nVaghjigai Enterprises (Sh894,940,801), Byusuff and Sons Ltd (Sh875,555,937) and\nUnibee Construction (Sh679,738,830) among other tenderers. Sources again allege\nthat the CEO was allegedly given Sh200m by Byusuff and Sons Ltd and was\nunprocedurally awarded the tender yet it was not the lowest bidder.</p>\n\n<p>To block the disgruntled\ntenderers from filing complaints at the Public Procurement Oversight Authority,\nMiulgo withholds regret letters to the unsuccessful bidders after 21 days to\ntechnically knock them out from taking the case to the PPOA for review.

The Public Finance Management Act Sec 125 (2) demands that the County Executive Committee must ensure that there is public participation in the entire budget process. Furthermore, the Public Finance Management Act Sec 137 demands formation of the County Budget and Economic Forum consisting of the governor, the County Executive Committee and members of the civil society.\nIn exercising this right as enshrined in the constitution, Wajir Anti-Corruption and Justice Forum sought to actively engage in the planning and management of the Wajir county public resources and service delivery by the Wajir county.\nIn its efforts to ensure efficacy in the budgeting and budgeting processes, the forum resolved to engage the services of a professional in budgeting and finance to assist them in analysing understand and critically evaluating the 2014/15 Wajir County Budget as presented to the county assembly and senate. It is widely alleged the last budget was literally looted.\nIn conducting the analysis, the consultant had a free hand to assess various relevant aspects of the budget but inter alia: Establish if the budget is in line with the Wajir County Fiscal Strategy Paper -if there is one in place, establish if the Wajir County Budget is in line and compliance with the Public Finance Management Act (2012)estimate the viability or otherwise of Wajir county 2014/15 budget as currently constituted and presented and approved by the country assembly and make recommendations to address issues (if any) identified to align the budget to the expectations and benefit of the people of Wajir county.\nIn doing the review, the main document was the Wajir County 2014/15 Budget as presented by the Wajir Anti-Corruption and Justice Forum. Two versions of the budget were availed two weeks apart\u2013 an initial budget and a revised version which Wajuf confirmed had been passed by the county assembly and presented to the senate.\nTheir scope of work was limited by lack of access to or non-existence of the following critical documents: Wajir county 2013/14 budget \u2013 this critical document is not available to the public either at the Wajir county official website or county offices as confirmed by Wajuf. Wajir County Fiscal Strategy Paper for the two years 2013/14 and 2014/15: to the best of information obtained this critical and legally required document is not in existence \u2013 it is not clear to us how was the budget developed without the CFSP. Budget narratives: \u201cBudgets are about making the best choices in allocating the scarce resources available to the county to meet the multitude of competing priorities. A good budget therefore must contain budget narratives that explain the choices that the county has made. Without this, we have made our assessment based on good practice and general information on budgeting and public information on Wajir county status needs and priorities as well as comparatives with other counties and national government,\u201d says the report.\nIn making the assessment the consultant addressed the structuring of the analysis to critically address, rationale for the budget, alignment of the budget to the county priorities, alignment to the CRSP, compliance with the law \u2013 budget financing \u2013 deficit and incorporation of county revenues into the budget, maintaining/improving level essential services\u2013equity in distribution of resources among the wards\u2013disclosure and amounts versus need/priority and development/sustainability potential of each ward and separation of county responsibilities from national responsibilities \u2013disclosure and in of expected revenues and allocation from national government, devolution etc.\nIn making their assessment, besides the professional, technical and general research and review, the consultant also made extensive reference to: -constitution of Kenya (2010) relevant chapters and acts, public finance management Act (2012), report of the controller of budget for Wajir county (and review of other counties for balance) and report of the Wajir Anti-Corruption and Justice Forum to the EACC.\nThe consultant observed glaring loopholes on the Wajir county budget for the year 2014-2015. It observed that the Wajir county budget does not have a narrative to explain the choices made in the budget in all the budget lines.\nThe roads and public works department, trade, industrialisation, co-operative department, public health department and others. It is necessary to have a narrative in the budget that explains the choices made in coming up with the budget lines. It is not possible to know what activities and expenses are envisioned in the budget lines which makes impossible to check whether the activities included are valid for this budget, check whether the amounts indicated are reasonable, check whether the activities represented present a fair distribution of resources within the county and check whether the totals of the budget line were correctly calculated.\nThe budget must have a detailed narrative indicating the activities and expenses envisioned for each budget line. This will encourage public participation and honour the accountability and transparency requirements of this budget. It is necessary to have a plan for the county from which the budget is produced. Adequate narration is necessary in the budget to show how the budget correlates with the plan. In the present scenario we are not sure if such a plan exists. According to the lobby, the budget must be produced with reference to the county plan. If no plan exists then one should first be produced and used as a source of guidance for the budget.\nThe budget does not have a clear priority target for in the budget. It was observed that the areas of high expenditure include roads and public works (1,565m or 22pc), public health (1,514M or 21pc) and water resources at (802m or 12pc). As mentioned in the general information above the current rain conditions do not favour farming. Self sustenance in farming is a major goal for the country and the same should feature prominently in the county plan and in this budget. The budget for agriculture (Sh568m) nearly equals the same for executive (Sh539). In our view the agricultural sector has not been given adequate priority. It is worth mentioning here that the agriculture and water departments are capital intensive and adequate funds would be necessary to make a difference.\nThe consultant wants adequate research done with the incorporation of public participation to ensure that areas of highest priority receive adequate funds. The budget shows various capital expenditures but does not mention where these expenditures will be. These include construction of ABT centres in the lands department and production of physical plans for three sub counties in the same department. The consultant wants that all plans for the county be done with fair distribution of the resources to the various districts in mind. The same should be documented in the budget.\nThe budget does not show comparison figures from the previous year. It was observed that various expenses and capital purchases were effected in the previous year, but none of these have been referenced in the current budget. That all budgets should have comparative figures which give a guideline on the expected expenditures for the current budget. This will also link the capital expenditures from the previous year which may not have been completed.\nThe budget does not show the amounts which may be collected by the county in form of local taxes and fees. It was observed that the budget does not mention any amounts that will be collected in this current year in form of taxes and fees. No mention is made on how much was collected in the previous year. This is contrary to the public finance management Act 130(1)(b)(iv). It is also worth noting that the Wajir county budget implementation report for January to March 2013 does show Sh9.3m as revenue for the four months in question which shows that it is a significant budget item. (WCBIR Mar \u2013 June 2.3). Budgets should have an indication of the amounts the county government expects to raise as their contribution to the budget.\nThe budget does not show how the county government expects to fund the resultant deficit. The budget shows an expected appropriation from the government of Sh6,278,070,000. The total budget is Sh7,100,794,284. There is a resultant deficit of about Sh823m. There is no information in the budget to show how this deficit will be funded. In the budget for the previous period, Wajir county did not show the amounts it intended to get from the national government and its local sources in the budget. (Kenya Budget Analysis: Wajir county No 6). This is a critical requirement that has been neglected in the current budget as well. Wajir residents want a proper balancing of the budget be done showing how all the expenditures will be funded.\nThe budget does not consistently have unit costs. It was observed that some of the departmental budgets have unit costs included (town administration offices) while no other department had this. Information on the unit costs in important as it confirms the prudence in the figures as to market values and overstatements are concerned. The consultant group wants all the departmental budgets to have a unit costs section filled out to show the units purchased.\nThe budget does not consistently have estimates for the next three years as is required. It was observed that most of the departmental budgets do not have Estimates for the next three years (town administration offices, ministry of agriculture, roads and public works and others). Information on the next three years budget estimates helps in ensuring the budget is rational and helps in preparing the next years budgets. Departmental budgets should have three-year estimates.\nThe budget shows a duplication of expenditure estimates in the financial management department and the county executive department.\nThe duplication shown above lacks explanation. The items in question are service centres that should be housed in one department. It beats logic to have multiple source centres for these expenditures. The combined total estimates for these items, looks excessive. It is important to have narrations especially when such anomalies appear in the budget. Such lack of narration provides room for corruption.\nA clear explanation needs to be given for this anomaly and a rethink on the amounts budgeted so as to show a more realistic budget. These amounts and other activities which are of this nature should be budgeted under one department. The budget does not give a clear distinction between the roles of the government and those of the county. It was observed that Wajir town activities should be central government functions, that a clear distinction be made between county functions and government functions and enough narration be included where there is overlap of functions.\nThe budget does not give a clear distinction between the roles of the government and those of the county. It was observed that Wajir town activities should be central government functions. The consultant wants a clear distinction be made between county functions and government functions and enough narration be included where there is overlap of functions.\nThe departmental budget for the county finance and planning does include three years estimates. These estimates however show a 10pc increment in the budget for all the recurrent items. It is totally unrealistic to assume a 10pc increase in the very varied expenses in the budget. The items include purchases of workshop tools, furniture and equipment. These items are one off expenses where we do not expect recurrent purchases at a uniform 10pc increment.\nThe consultant wants care taken to include in the budget accurate figures with assumptions that are well thought out and researched. Again an inclusion of narratives would have helped to show whether the assumptions implied are valid. Also the budget does not have a budget policy statement. The PFMA 2012 requires the county budget to include a summary that contains the budget summary. This is an important statement as it gives the budget an anchor for the choices made in the budget. The consultant wants the budget to include a summary with the required details to justify the choices made in the planning process.\nThe lack of comparatives from previous period and information on the steps taken to improve the current year budget are critical. Items like the tarmacking of Wajir town appear on both budgets with no update on implementation. The issues raised in the previous budget and on its implementation, there is no clear change in the process of budget making.\nIn its current state this budget can be a vehicle for misappropriations. Without the narratives that guide expenditure many expenses can be included in implementation that were not envisaged during the planning of the budget.Wajir country has not addressed the identified lack of capacity to prepare a coherent comprehensive budget (Controller of Budget Wajir County Budget Implementation Report March \u2013 June 2013). This lack of capacity still exists and is demonstrated by the fact that there was a recommendation that there needs to be professionalism in the budgeting process with concerted public participation and accuracy, consistency and compliancy by the setting up of an internal efficiency monitoring framework and evaluation. (WCBIR March \u2013 June 3.6 (3)). Lack of consistency in the current budget with different formats for the various departments which do not meet the requirements of this budget. Agriculture, public works and water resource are all different from each other.\n\u201cWe cannot tell if the designated information system is in place as no evidence of its output is evident. Again the report (WCBIR March \u2013 June 3.6 (2) did recommend making the IFMIS operational. The county budget is a key tool for the distribution of funds to the Wajir residents in an equitable, transparent and accountable manner. This needs to be evident in its production, implementation and reporting functions. At the moment this is not evident,\u201d says the report.\nBased on the above observations and facts, the Wajir county budget as currently constituted is not and cannot be recommended for implementation. The lobby wants the budget recalled and a competent expert engaged to support the country in reviewing and revising the budget to address the identified gaps and the public to be involved in the process in line with the constitution and public finance management Act (2012). There is no public participation in Wajir county affairs. The budget and tenders are all fixed in Nairobi hotels. Wajir residents are shocked as to how the government can allow these kind of fraudulent budget to find its way and passed without scrutiny.\nWajir resident are querring how the controller of budget and the senate passed such kind of a budget with glaring fraudulent discrepancies that cannot be implemented. This is part of the evidence we are going to present to the senate in support of the petition currently before the senate,\u201d said Abikar who is the chair of Wajuf.\nThe lobby has been fighting corruption in the county by presenting the grievances of the residents to the Ethics and Anti-Corruption Commission and other oversight government agencies. A petition to the president has been filed with the senate. EACC investigation into the affairs of Wajir county is in top gear. The lobby group is working on the 2013/14 budget analysis and already theft through budget lines close to Sh500m has been discovered. Over Sh1b is separately believed to have been looted through single sourcing, price inflation, dubious allowances and general malpractices. A further Sh500m is also believed to have been lost through short changing of specification after the award of tenders to companies associated to the governor campaign financiers. Wajir residents are concerned that the county is not functioning. Out of the 700 days since the inception of county government, Wajir governor is said to have in the county less than 98 days, He is said to be busy either in Nairobi making deals, fixing tender awards, to allegedly conceal corruption cases or busy buying properties.", "articleBodyHtml": "<article>\n\n<p>The Constitution of of Kenya 2010 Article 196 (1) (b) demands public participation and involvement in the legislative and other business of the national assembly and its committees.

Revellers at the popular joint could not believe what they were being treated\nto as the senator unbuttoned the man\u2019s shirt and started caressing his chest in a revealing manner.

Upon explanation, she said \u201cwe are in a mess dear\u201d and told her man to zoom off.\nThis is not the first time the senator is finding herself in trouble socially. Last year, a woman by the name Pauline Mbewa came out to claim the senator was having an affair with her husband Thomas Mbewa. It is said the senator who is in senate on Uhuru Kenyatta\u2019s TNA ticket, nearly caused Mbewa\u2019s marriage to crumble when she started dating Mbewa. The couple has been in marriage for eight years. It forced Mbewa\u2019s wife to desert her matrimonial home leaving behind her children for months.\nPauline\u2019s efforts to engage Mbewa relatives to solve the matter hit a snag. It is said a planned marriage between Mbewa and the senator has failed to proceed after the man discovered his lover has a chain of men some of who were ready to stop their marriage either in court or in church for reasons best known to them.\nMbewa at one time was quoted saying: \u201cIt is true I\u2019m dating Joy and we have known each other for the last three years. It has been an on-and-off relationship which my wife knows about and we decided to formalise it. We are now engaged and very soon, I will call you and other members of the Fourth Estate for a formal marriage.\u201d This has however never come to pass.\nWhen the senator last year was arrested of being drunk and locked at Muthaiga Police Station, a man now believed to be the one who was with the senator during her Upper Hill escapade visited her at the police station. He is the one who bailed her on the morning of Sunday March 30 2014. Mbewa was not informed of the saga only to learn from press reports. Gwendo spent the night in a police cell after failing an alcoblow test at midnight. She had been having a good time with a friend and had dispatched her government-paid aides. Since the arrest saga, the senator and Mbewa\u2019s relationship has hit rocks.\nThe manner in which she landed TNA nomination has been at the centre of discussions with word that she used her sexual prowess to land the coveted seat. She is also said to have fallen out with a top TNA official behind her nomination.\nRecently, TNA Kisumu county branch called for her expulsion from the party.\nThe branch in a letter to national office, wants her stripped off the senate nomination among other disciplinary measures. Area party officials say she is an ODM mole and has been summoned by the office on several occasions over her conduct, but deliberations have not borne any fruit. Party county coordinator Juma Midigo said they had decided to send Gwendo away and are looking for replacement to be presented to the party.\nJoy worked at Royal Media as a creative journalist. Those close to her say that she has a weakness of falling in love with men at social joints instantly and on first sight.

We are\nnow engaged and very soon, I will call you and other members of the Fourth\nEstate for a formal marriage.\u201d This has however never come to pass.<br>\nWhen the senator last year was arrested of being drunk and locked at Muthaiga\nPolice Station, a man now believed to be the one who was with the senator during\nher Upper Hill escapade visited her at the police station. He is the one who\nbailed her on the morning of Sunday March 30 2014. Mbewa was not informed of\nthe saga only to learn from press reports. Gwendo\u00a0 spent the night in a\npolice cell after failing an alcoblow test at midnight. She had been having a\ngood time with a friend and had dispatched her government-paid aides. Since the\narrest saga, the senator and Mbewa\u2019s relationship has hit rocks.<br>\nThe manner in which she landed TNA nomination has been at the centre of\ndiscussions with word that she used her sexual prowess to land the coveted\nseat. She is also said to have fallen out with a top TNA official behind her\nnomination. <br>\nRecently, TNA Kisumu county branch called for her expulsion from the party.<br>\nThe branch in a letter to national office, wants her stripped off the senate\nnomination among other disciplinary measures. Area party officials say she is\nan ODM mole and has been summoned by the office on several occasions over her\nconduct, but deliberations have not borne any fruit. Party county coordinator\nJuma Midigo said they had decided to send Gwendo away and are looking for\nreplacement to be presented to the party. <br>\nJoy worked at Royal Media as a creative journalist. Those close to her say that\nshe has a weakness of falling in love with men at social joints instantly and\non first sight. She had sometimes back after her arrest stopped taking alcohol\npreferring soft drinks but she is back at it.<br></p>\n\n</article>", "canonicalUrl": "http://weeklycitizennewspaper.blogspot.com/2015/05/senator-in-asex-drama-at-car-park.html"},{"url": "http://weeklycitizennewspaper.blogspot.com/2014/", "probability": 0.7926705, "headline": "MIKE SONKO: THE STONE THE BUILDERS REJECTED HAS BECOME THE CORNER STONE", "datePublished": "2021-12-15T00:45:00", "datePublishedRaw": "00:45", "author": "Unknown", "authorsList": ["Unknown"], "inLanguage": "en", "mainImage": "http://2.bp.blogspot.com/-ZSEw0Wz4D-E/VKO2aEglM3I/AAAAAAAACE4/wndSI0ok5sA/s1600/11111.jpg", "images": ["http://2.bp.blogspot.com/-ZSEw0Wz4D-E/VKO2aEglM3I/AAAAAAAACE4/wndSI0ok5sA/s1600/11111.jpg", "http://1.bp.blogspot.com/-kG88EHEiluY/VJlhx3iZR5I/AAAAAAAACD8/S7NC68gGw6U/s1600/11.jpg", "http://4.bp.blogspot.com/-BTm2qM7BbS8/VKJUnn0bYNI/AAAAAAAACEo/IL6_rEGS3qY/s1600/00000000.jpg"], "description": "In exercising this right as enshrined in the constitution, Wajir Anti-Corruption and Justice Forum sought to actively engage in the planning and management of the Wajir county public resources and service delivery by the Wajir county.

The Public Finance Management Act Sec 125 (2) demands that the County Executive Committee must ensure that there is public participation in the entire budget process. Furthermore, the Public Finance Management Act Sec 137 demands formation of the County Budget and Economic Forum consisting of the governor, the County Executive Committee and members of the civil society.\nIn exercising this right as enshrined in the constitution, Wajir Anti-Corruption and Justice Forum sought to actively engage in the planning and management of the Wajir county public resources and service delivery by the Wajir county.\nIn its efforts to ensure efficacy in the budgeting and budgeting processes, the forum resolved to engage the services of a professional in budgeting and finance to assist them in analysing understand and critically evaluating the 2014/15 Wajir County Budget as presented to the county assembly and senate. It is widely alleged the last budget was literally looted.\nIn conducting the analysis, the consultant had a free hand to assess various relevant aspects of the budget but inter alia: Establish if the budget is in line with the Wajir County Fiscal Strategy Paper -if there is one in place, establish if the Wajir County Budget is in line and compliance with the Public Finance Management Act (2012)estimate the viability or otherwise of Wajir county 2014/15 budget as currently constituted and presented and approved by the country assembly and make recommendations to address issues (if any) identified to align the budget to the expectations and benefit of the people of Wajir county.\nIn doing the review, the main document was the Wajir County 2014/15 Budget as presented by the Wajir Anti-Corruption and Justice Forum. Two versions of the budget were availed two weeks apart\u2013 an initial budget and a revised version which Wajuf confirmed had been passed by the county assembly and presented to the senate.\nTheir scope of work was limited by lack of access to or non-existence of the following critical documents: Wajir county 2013/14 budget \u2013 this critical document is not available to the public either at the Wajir county official website or county offices as confirmed by Wajuf. Wajir County Fiscal Strategy Paper for the two years 2013/14 and 2014/15: to the best of information obtained this critical and legally required document is not in existence \u2013 it is not clear to us how was the budget developed without the CFSP. Budget narratives: \u201cBudgets are about making the best choices in allocating the scarce resources available to the county to meet the multitude of competing priorities. A good budget therefore must contain budget narratives that explain the choices that the county has made. Without this, we have made our assessment based on good practice and general information on budgeting and public information on Wajir county status needs and priorities as well as comparatives with other counties and national government,\u201d says the report.\nIn making the assessment the consultant addressed the structuring of the analysis to critically address, rationale for the budget, alignment of the budget to the county priorities, alignment to the CRSP, compliance with the law \u2013 budget financing \u2013 deficit and incorporation of county revenues into the budget, maintaining/improving level essential services\u2013equity in distribution of resources among the wards\u2013disclosure and amounts versus need/priority and development/sustainability potential of each ward and separation of county responsibilities from national responsibilities \u2013disclosure and in of expected revenues and allocation from national government, devolution etc.\nIn making their assessment, besides the professional, technical and general research and review, the consultant also made extensive reference to: -constitution of Kenya (2010) relevant chapters and acts, public finance management Act (2012), report of the controller of budget for Wajir county (and review of other counties for balance) and report of the Wajir Anti-Corruption and Justice Forum to the EACC.\nThe consultant observed glaring loopholes on the Wajir county budget for the year 2014-2015. It observed that the Wajir county budget does not have a narrative to explain the choices made in the budget in all the budget lines.\nThe roads and public works department, trade, industrialisation, co-operative department, public health department and others. It is necessary to have a narrative in the budget that explains the choices made in coming up with the budget lines. It is not possible to know what activities and expenses are envisioned in the budget lines which makes impossible to check whether the activities included are valid for this budget, check whether the amounts indicated are reasonable, check whether the activities represented present a fair distribution of resources within the county and check whether the totals of the budget line were correctly calculated.\nThe budget must have a detailed narrative indicating the activities and expenses envisioned for each budget line. This will encourage public participation and honour the accountability and transparency requirements of this budget. It is necessary to have a plan for the county from which the budget is produced. Adequate narration is necessary in the budget to show how the budget correlates with the plan. In the present scenario we are not sure if such a plan exists. According to the lobby, the budget must be produced with reference to the county plan. If no plan exists then one should first be produced and used as a source of guidance for the budget.\nThe budget does not have a clear priority target for in the budget. It was observed that the areas of high expenditure include roads and public works (1,565m or 22pc), public health (1,514M or 21pc) and water resources at (802m or 12pc). As mentioned in the general information above the current rain conditions do not favour farming. Self sustenance in farming is a major goal for the country and the same should feature prominently in the county plan and in this budget. The budget for agriculture (Sh568m) nearly equals the same for executive (Sh539). In our view the agricultural sector has not been given adequate priority. It is worth mentioning here that the agriculture and water departments are capital intensive and adequate funds would be necessary to make a difference.\nThe consultant wants adequate research done with the incorporation of public participation to ensure that areas of highest priority receive adequate funds. The budget shows various capital expenditures but does not mention where these expenditures will be. These include construction of ABT centres in the lands department and production of physical plans for three sub counties in the same department. The consultant wants that all plans for the county be done with fair distribution of the resources to the various districts in mind. The same should be documented in the budget.\nThe budget does not show comparison figures from the previous year. It was observed that various expenses and capital purchases were effected in the previous year, but none of these have been referenced in the current budget. That all budgets should have comparative figures which give a guideline on the expected expenditures for the current budget. This will also link the capital expenditures from the previous year which may not have been completed.\nThe budget does not show the amounts which may be collected by the county in form of local taxes and fees. It was observed that the budget does not mention any amounts that will be collected in this current year in form of taxes and fees. No mention is made on how much was collected in the previous year. This is contrary to the public finance management Act 130(1)(b)(iv). It is also worth noting that the Wajir county budget implementation report for January to March 2013 does show Sh9.3m as revenue for the four months in question which shows that it is a significant budget item. (WCBIR Mar \u2013 June 2.3). Budgets should have an indication of the amounts the county government expects to raise as their contribution to the budget.\nThe budget does not show how the county government expects to fund the resultant deficit. The budget shows an expected appropriation from the government of Sh6,278,070,000. The total budget is Sh7,100,794,284. There is a resultant deficit of about Sh823m. There is no information in the budget to show how this deficit will be funded. In the budget for the previous period, Wajir county did not show the amounts it intended to get from the national government and its local sources in the budget. (Kenya Budget Analysis: Wajir county No 6). This is a critical requirement that has been neglected in the current budget as well. Wajir residents want a proper balancing of the budget be done showing how all the expenditures will be funded.\nThe budget does not consistently have unit costs. It was observed that some of the departmental budgets have unit costs included (town administration offices) while no other department had this. Information on the unit costs in important as it confirms the prudence in the figures as to market values and overstatements are concerned. The consultant group wants all the departmental budgets to have a unit costs section filled out to show the units purchased.\nThe budget does not consistently have estimates for the next three years as is required. It was observed that most of the departmental budgets do not have Estimates for the next three years (town administration offices, ministry of agriculture, roads and public works and others). Information on the next three years budget estimates helps in ensuring the budget is rational and helps in preparing the next years budgets. Departmental budgets should have three-year estimates.\nThe budget shows a duplication of expenditure estimates in the financial management department and the county executive department.\nThe duplication shown above lacks explanation. The items in question are service centres that should be housed in one department. It beats logic to have multiple source centres for these expenditures. The combined total estimates for these items, looks excessive. It is important to have narrations especially when such anomalies appear in the budget. Such lack of narration provides room for corruption.\nA clear explanation needs to be given for this anomaly and a rethink on the amounts budgeted so as to show a more realistic budget. These amounts and other activities which are of this nature should be budgeted under one department. The budget does not give a clear distinction between the roles of the government and those of the county. It was observed that Wajir town activities should be central government functions, that a clear distinction be made between county functions and government functions and enough narration be included where there is overlap of functions.\nThe budget does not give a clear distinction between the roles of the government and those of the county. It was observed that Wajir town activities should be central government functions. The consultant wants a clear distinction be made between county functions and government functions and enough narration be included where there is overlap of functions.\nThe departmental budget for the county finance and planning does include three years estimates. These estimates however show a 10pc increment in the budget for all the recurrent items. It is totally unrealistic to assume a 10pc increase in the very varied expenses in the budget. The items include purchases of workshop tools, furniture and equipment. These items are one off expenses where we do not expect recurrent purchases at a uniform 10pc increment.\nThe consultant wants care taken to include in the budget accurate figures with assumptions that are well thought out and researched. Again an inclusion of narratives would have helped to show whether the assumptions implied are valid. Also the budget does not have a budget policy statement. The PFMA 2012 requires the county budget to include a summary that contains the budget summary. This is an important statement as it gives the budget an anchor for the choices made in the budget. The consultant wants the budget to include a summary with the required details to justify the choices made in the planning process.\nThe lack of comparatives from previous period and information on the steps taken to improve the current year budget are critical. Items like the tarmacking of Wajir town appear on both budgets with no update on implementation. The issues raised in the previous budget and on its implementation, there is no clear change in the process of budget making.\nIn its current state this budget can be a vehicle for misappropriations. Without the narratives that guide expenditure many expenses can be included in implementation that were not envisaged during the planning of the budget.Wajir country has not addressed the identified lack of capacity to prepare a coherent comprehensive budget (Controller of Budget Wajir County Budget Implementation Report March \u2013 June 2013). This lack of capacity still exists and is demonstrated by the fact that there was a recommendation that there needs to be professionalism in the budgeting process with concerted public participation and accuracy, consistency and compliancy by the setting up of an internal efficiency monitoring framework and evaluation. (WCBIR March \u2013 June 3.6 (3)). Lack of consistency in the current budget with different formats for the various departments which do not meet the requirements of this budget. Agriculture, public works and water resource are all different from each other.\n\u201cWe cannot tell if the designated information system is in place as no evidence of its output is evident. Again the report (WCBIR March \u2013 June 3.6 (2) did recommend making the IFMIS operational. The county budget is a key tool for the distribution of funds to the Wajir residents in an equitable, transparent and accountable manner. This needs to be evident in its production, implementation and reporting functions. At the moment this is not evident,\u201d says the report.\nBased on the above observations and facts, the Wajir county budget as currently constituted is not and cannot be recommended for implementation. The lobby wants the budget recalled and a competent expert engaged to support the country in reviewing and revising the budget to address the identified gaps and the public to be involved in the process in line with the constitution and public finance management Act (2012). There is no public participation in Wajir county affairs. The budget and tenders are all fixed in Nairobi hotels. Wajir residents are shocked as to how the government can allow these kind of fraudulent budget to find its way and passed without scrutiny.\nWajir resident are querring how the controller of budget and the senate passed such kind of a budget with glaring fraudulent discrepancies that cannot be implemented. This is part of the evidence we are going to present to the senate in support of the petition currently before the senate,\u201d said Abikar who is the chair of Wajuf.\nThe lobby has been fighting corruption in the county by presenting the grievances of the residents to the Ethics and Anti-Corruption Commission and other oversight government agencies. A petition to the president has been filed with the senate. EACC investigation into the affairs of Wajir county is in top gear. The lobby group is working on the 2013/14 budget analysis and already theft through budget lines close to Sh500m has been discovered. Over Sh1b is separately believed to have been looted through single sourcing, price inflation, dubious allowances and general malpractices. A further Sh500m is also believed to have been lost through short changing of specification after the award of tenders to companies associated to the governor campaign financiers. Wajir residents are concerned that the county is not functioning. Out of the 700 days since the inception of county government, Wajir governor is said to have in the county less than 98 days, He is said to be busy either in Nairobi making deals, fixing tender awards, to allegedly conceal corruption cases or busy buying properties.", "articleBodyHtml": "<article>\n\n<p>The Constitution of of Kenya 2010 Article 196 (1) (b) demands public participation and involvement in the legislative and other business of the national assembly and its committees.

The dragon has however transformed itself, and has the head of a dragon, mouth of a lion, eyes of the cobra, claws of a leopard, stomach of a hyena and body of an octopus\nAll these was observed by the Blue Eye team, in the recently concluded (MSCK - Dinossaur) annual general meeting, held on April 30 at Embu\u2019s Kangaru Boys\u2019 High School.\nSince the inception of the institution in 1983, with a team whose interest touched on the hearts of members, the first directors were Laban Juma Toto, David Amunga, Rajab S Chumbii, Daudi Kabaka, Betty Njeri Tett, Griffith Justus Siboe, Rautta Athiambo and Robert Noel Simpson.\nThis was a team that had the interests of Kenyan musicians at heart but the manner in which they were shoved out leaves a lot to be desired and exactly what happened baffles many as carnivores took over as the herbivores were shown the exit door.\nAll this happened in 2003 and during this time under the chairmanship of the late Habel Kifoto, things were not all that bad, but that was to last for a short time as the institution was infested by advocates, office of the registrar and the Attorney General\u2019s office. This had a great opportunity of money made in collections but they took advantage of members\u2019 ignorance and lack of knowledge by introducing divide and rule tactics and segregation of members with those to be given and not to be given royalties which gave them a loophole to manipulate and oppress them. Kifoto will be remembered for his foresight and many musicians praise and honour him as he was always there to assist members.\nHis death was indeed a big blow to artists as things started to take a nosedive in 2011 when the clique came on board and took over the chairmanship. Members complain that the last time they got royalty of Sh10,000 was before Makupa Annual General meeting but since then, over six years ago, the collective management organisation has not been distributing royalties to its members, confining it into insolvency for failing in its mandate guaranteed by its members and contravening regulatory organ the Kenya Copyright Board law under section 46 article 4 (d) to collect and distribute the royalties, to which its liable and subjected to deregistration under article 9 (b).\nIt is difficult for one to understand how MSCK operates since it is a long time since members started complaining over the manner in which they are being mistreated by the institution, lack of royalties and misappropriation of funds, a scenario where Kenya Copyright Board should address. There are accusations of lack of knowledge on the plight of the artistes, lack of interpretation of the copyright law on their part which is seen as one of the major problems facing musicians. If you cite the copyright law section 5 on the functions of board, (g) a word \u201cancillary\u201d depending on how is used and understood, can make a difference in meaning with different angles of understanding. If used as noun or adjective it has different meanings. Therefore depending on how the word is used, then it can be difficult for the institution to be insolvent or wound up, as the impression is that MSCK is a subsidiary of the Kenya Copyright Board. The other main problem of the artistes lies within the attorney general\u2019s office, under Githu Mungai, whose office Kenya Copyright Board falls under and Bernice Gachegu in the registrar\u2019s office. That is the reason why complaints have always fallen on deaf ears, it is said.\nWhat might be the problem with artists? When and how will the members, extricate themselves out of this mess of mental captivity and exploitation.\nThe answer is very simple and clear, lack of power of the pen.\nMany musicians wonder whether the Sh3,000 given as allowance during the AGM is considered as allowance or royalty. A source said that members of the society were ignorant of their rights as many of their works were being played out through electronic media like skiza tunes, ringstones. Other monies generated are through general distribution also known as Triple P, being money collected from public performing places which members should be given without any discrimination that amounts to millions of shillings, a source said.\nTherights members of the society that they need to enjoy include patent rights, mutilation rights, distortion rights and mechanical rights\n\u201cIf justice is done, I can guarantee you that the musician\u2019s eighth generation can live on their sweat. A song is like a 100-storey building which no one should be allowed to tamper with. It is either you say enough is enough and demand for your rights, or continue to live in poverty throughout your remaining life in the world,\u201d a member said.\nThe source asked members to change their attitude in the manner in which they would want the society ran before it is turned into another Mboi-Kamiti.\n\u201cIt\u2019s time for members to change their attitude of thinking and doing things. If not so, there are very hard times for the members ahead. Changing the directors should not change anything much as the board is weak, vulnerable and easy to manipulate. The concluded elections were a mockery of justice, propagated by the office under CEO Maurice Okoth and the outgoing chairman Mike Maganzo, in conjunction with the company secretary Martha Maina,\u201d claimed a member.\nMaina was heckled and booed when she rose up to read the outcome of the elections, She was accused of misleading the society with poor legal advice and having an incompetent record in reference.\n\u201cThe big question is: is she taking MSCK the way of Kihiu Muiri Society and the defunct Mboi-Kamiti which ended up in disarray, killings, disappearance of persons among other awful atrocities and which resulted to deregistration of the society?\u201d posed another member.\nShe was accused of posing a threat to the existence MCSK as she was known for going by the wave of \u201cwhere the money is\u201d.\nThe management team christened Maganzo people\u2019s operatives are to be the only members who hold the society\u2019s top secrets on how the society operates and thus are untouchable.\n\u201cAll what went on that day was victory to the office, reason being that the whole management team are called Maganzo\u2019s operatives,\u201d members lamented. They accused Maganzo, Okoth and Jacklene Oduor of manipulating the elections. Maganzo further went ahead and filed a petition challenging Nairobi elections. However, members believe that the court petition will be struck off.\n\u201cMCSK made sure that its magic scoring card was well set and applied from the beginning as it all started from candidates\u2019 nominations. During the process of opening the nomination box, one candidate stopped the opening until and unless all contentious issues of election irregularities were addressed for free and fair elections but he was condemned for allegedly bringing in politics resulting into having the society secretary to unanimously be forced to open the box.\nSources said it was at that time the crookedness of officals became apparent as the axe of disqualification fell on Henry Njenga, (Mwalimu), Albert Gacheru (Wamaitu), Makali, Jared, CDM Kiratu, Saitoti, Lincon, SK Nderitu, Man Igwe, Maneno and Lady B.\nSince these names were on the ballot paper, a court injunction was hurriedly sought to restrict the elections from taking place among other issues.

The dragon has however transformed itself, and has the head of a dragon, mouth of a lion, eyes of the cobra, claws of a leopard, stomach of a hyena and body of an octopus<br>All these was observed by the Blue Eye team, in the recently concluded (MSCK - Dinossaur) annual general meeting, held on April 30 at Embu\u2019s Kangaru Boys\u2019 High School.<br>Since the inception of the institution in 1983, with a team whose interest touched on the hearts of members, the first directors were Laban Juma Toto,\u00a0 David Amunga, Rajab S Chumbii, Daudi Kabaka, Betty Njeri Tett, Griffith Justus Siboe, Rautta Athiambo and Robert Noel Simpson.<br>\u00a0This was a team that had the interests of Kenyan musicians at heart but the manner in which they were shoved out leaves a lot to be desired and exactly what happened baffles many as carnivores took over as the herbivores were shown the exit door.<br>All this happened in 2003 and during this time under the chairmanship of the late Habel Kifoto, things were not all that bad, but that was to last for a short time as the institution was infested by advocates, office of the registrar and the Attorney General\u2019s office. This had a great opportunity of money made in collections but they took advantage of members\u2019 ignorance and lack of knowledge by introducing divide and rule tactics and segregation of members with those to be given and not to be given royalties which gave them a loophole to manipulate and oppress them. Kifoto will be remembered for his foresight and many musicians praise and honour him as he was always there to assist members.\u00a0 <br>His death was indeed a big blow to artists as things started to take a nosedive in 2011 when the clique came on board and took over the chairmanship. Members\u00a0 complain that the last time they got royalty of\u00a0 Sh10,000 was before Makupa Annual General meeting but\u00a0 since then,\u00a0 over six years ago, the collective management organisation has not been distributing royalties to its members, confining it into insolvency for failing in its mandate guaranteed by its members and contravening regulatory organ the\u00a0 Kenya Copyright Board law under section 46 article 4 (d) to collect and distribute the royalties, to which its liable and subjected to deregistration under article 9 (b).<br>It is difficult for one to understand how MSCK operates since it is a long time since members started complaining over the manner in which they are being mistreated by the institution, lack of royalties and misappropriation of funds, a scenario where Kenya Copyright Board\u00a0 should address. There are accusations of lack of knowledge on the plight of the artistes, lack of interpretation of the copyright law on their part which is seen as one of the major problems facing musicians. If you cite the copyright law section 5 on the functions of board,\u00a0 (g) a word \u201cancillary\u201d depending on how is used and understood, can make a difference in meaning with different angles of understanding. If used as noun or adjective it has different meanings. Therefore depending on how the word is used, then it can be difficult for the institution to be insolvent or wound up, as the impression is that MSCK is a subsidiary of the Kenya Copyright Board. The other main problem of the artistes lies within the attorney general\u2019s office, under Githu Mungai, whose office Kenya Copyright Board falls under and Bernice Gachegu in the registrar\u2019s office. That is the reason why complaints have always fallen on deaf ears, it is said.<br>What might be the problem with artists? When and how will the members, extricate themselves out of this mess of mental captivity and exploitation. <br>The answer is very simple and clear, lack of power of the pen.<br>Many musicians wonder whether the Sh3,000 given as allowance during the AGM is considered as allowance or royalty. A source said that members of the society were ignorant of their rights as many of their works were being played out through electronic media like skiza tunes, ringstones. Other monies generated are through general distribution also known as Triple P, being money collected from public performing places which members should be given without any discrimination that amounts to millions of shillings, a source said.<br>\u00a0Therights members of the society that they need to enjoy include\u00a0 patent rights, mutilation rights, distortion rights and mechanical rights<br>\u201cIf justice is done, I can guarantee you that the musician\u2019s eighth generation can live on their sweat. A song is like a 100-storey building which no one should be allowed to tamper with. It is either you say enough is enough and demand for your rights, or continue to live in poverty throughout your remaining life in the world,\u201d a member said.<br>The source asked members to change their attitude in the manner in which they would want the society ran before it is turned into another Mboi-Kamiti. <br>\u00a0\u201cIt\u2019s time for members to change their attitude of thinking and doing things. If not so, there are very hard times for the members ahead. Changing the directors should not change anything much as the board is weak, vulnerable and easy to manipulate. The concluded elections were a mockery of justice, propagated by the office\u00a0 under CEO Maurice Okoth and the outgoing chairman Mike Maganzo, in conjunction with the company secretary Martha Maina,\u201d claimed a member.\u00a0 <br>Maina was heckled and booed when she rose up to read the outcome of the elections, She was accused of misleading the society with poor legal advice and having an incompetent record in reference.<br>\u00a0\u201cThe big question is: is she taking MSCK the way of Kihiu Muiri Society and the defunct Mboi-Kamiti which ended up in disarray, killings, disappearance of persons among other awful atrocities and which resulted to deregistration of the society?\u201d posed another member.<br>She was accused of posing a threat to the existence MCSK as she was known for going by the wave of \u201cwhere the money is\u201d.\u00a0 <br>The management team christened Maganzo people\u2019s operatives are to be the only members who hold the society\u2019s top secrets on how the society operates and thus are untouchable. <br>\u201cAll what went on that day was victory to the office, reason being that the whole management team are called Maganzo\u2019s operatives,\u201d members lamented. They accused Maganzo, Okoth and Jacklene Oduor of manipulating the elections.\u00a0 Maganzo further went ahead and filed a petition challenging Nairobi elections. However, members believe that the court petition will be struck off. <br>\u201cMCSK made sure that its magic scoring card was well set and applied from the beginning as it all started from candidates\u2019 nominations. During the process of opening the nomination box, one candidate stopped the opening until and unless all contentious issues of election irregularities were addressed\u00a0\u00a0 for free and fair elections but he was condemned for allegedly bringing in politics resulting into having the society secretary to unanimously be forced to open the box. <br>Sources said it was at that time the crookedness of officals became apparent as the axe of disqualification fell on Henry Njenga, (Mwalimu),\u00a0\u00a0 Albert Gacheru (Wamaitu), Makali, Jared, CDM Kiratu, Saitoti,\u00a0 Lincon,\u00a0 SK Nderitu, Man Igwe,\u00a0 Maneno and Lady B.<br>Since these names were on the ballot paper, a court injunction was hurriedly sought to restrict the elections from taking place among other issues. The petition was however struck off and elections were done with a lot of irregularities in favour of those who were elected who had adopted a divide and rule tactics. <br>For Maganzo to get his third term in office, a plan was hatched to change the constitution and come up with what they termed as a new era called Mwamko Mpya.\u00a0\u00a0 But the writing is on the wall for the officials after Nairobi Moi Avenue musicians dubbed Mayoyo and their counterparts on River Road known as Wahenga have ganged up and are quietly scheming on how to oust the current officials from office.<br>Besides that, there is a case in court filed by a member, accusing the society of various irregularities by the management which is causing Okoth sleepless nights.

Records indicate that Hannington Oriedo who until his death was a trustee in the organisation died in 2008.

The assembly adopted a report by an ad hoc committee that presented Musambayi\u2019s corruption allegations to a forensic audit by other investigative arms of government.<br>\u00a0The bodies include the Ethics and Anti-Corruption Commission, Public Procurement Oversight Authority, Senate and the Kenya National Commission on Human Rights.<br>\u00a0\u201cHe will only get his job back if the bodies clear him of any wrong doing,\u201d says a report by the ad hoc committee. <br>Musambayi is also fighting to clear his name over accusations of irregular procurement, misappropriation of funds, insubordination and violation of the constitution.<br>Although the assembly suspended the clerk pending further investigations, a group of members of county assembly led by Abdallah Chogo said they will push the county assembly service board into writing him a sacking letter.<br>The board has also been asked to freeze all his personal accounts and pay him half his monthly salary for the period he will be on suspension.<br>\u00a0The assembly found that the imprest and car loan and mortgage accounts have grave irregular withdrawals done by the embattled clerk who added up as the accounts administrator.<br>The deputy governor is on record doubting whether all the people who were to travel with him travelled despite banking hefty per diems. \u201cThey should also bring their passports as proof that they travelled,\u201d Amaswache is quoted in the report.<br>\u00a0Kamidi, a nominated MCA argued that the suspended clerk could not carry the \u2018stealing\u2019 cross alone and called for more heads to roll.<br></p>\n\n</article>", "canonicalUrl": "http://weeklycitizennewspaper.blogspot.com/2015/05/mp-wants-vihiga-deputy-governor-out-of.html"},{"url": "http://weeklycitizennewspaper.blogspot.com/search?updated-max=2016-03-16T01:17:00-07:00&max-results=15", "probability": 0.7965793, "headline": "NCIC descends on Maasai Maara University", "datePublished": "2021-12-15T23:54:00", "datePublishedRaw": "23:54", "author": "Unknown", "authorsList": ["Unknown"], "inLanguage": "en", "mainImage": "https://1.bp.blogspot.com/-v5BBhbMB1XU/Vsq-wefWJCI/AAAAAAAACTY/L0_AALo1dsI/s320/vc.png", "images": ["https://1.bp.blogspot.com/-v5BBhbMB1XU/Vsq-wefWJCI/AAAAAAAACTY/L0_AALo1dsI/s320/vc.png", "http://2.bp.blogspot.com/-PLE2-IvMqAU/VbX47e_FE3I/AAAAAAAACR0/ca5kV7oGH3k/s320/IMG_20150722_165833.jpg", "http://3.bp.blogspot.com/-Kh7hifxy_s4/VbX4q_4dQKI/AAAAAAAACRs/tGBa9bCVKXs/s320/IMG_20150722_165803.jpg"], "description": "A BAR owner in Kisumu has threatened to move to court after local police allegedly stormed his premises clobbered staff and forcefully broke into rooms breaking doors and windows against presidential order that property not be destroyed in the current down on illicit drinks.
