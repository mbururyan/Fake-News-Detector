Planting flowers, or having them in pots, at the front door will also create a welcoming feel.\n\nA warm welcome\n\nHave a welcome pack with a small selection of treats and visitor information waiting for guests upon their arrival.

Try an online design programme like Canva to put your guide together and make it look professional.\n\nNobody wants ordinary\n\nWhen you\u2019re decorating a space for holiday guests, it\u2019s tempting to tone it down so that the d\u00e9cor will appeal to all, but remember that people want wow. Guests want a space that feels like a home from home but they\u2019re also paying for an experience. Colour, beautiful art, a stand-out furniture piece, deep-pile rugs in the bedroom or a luxe addition like a log fireplace or a jacuzzi will be memorable (and romantic!).\n\nIf your home is surrounded by beautiful scenery, invest in floor-length glass windows or doors for views that will really sell your holiday home. Never fall into the trap of choosing cheap d\u00e9cor items, or worse still, decorating a space with the things you don\u2019t want at home. Old, cheap and boring are to be avoided at all costs. When people walk into your holiday rental they want to find the equivalent, or better, than what they have at home.\n\nWhat guests want\n\nEvaluate every part of your holiday space and think about what you can do to make your guests\u2019 experience memorable. The living room must have a cosy place where they can relax and read a book or watch a movie and, if possible, a smart TV.\n\nIn the kitchen, make sure there\u2019s everything that guests need to easily be able to self-cater. If you can, add in luxe touches such as an espresso machine or a smoothie maker. It\u2019s things like this people will tell their friends about.\n\nSuperior service\n\nHolidaymakers want to relax and spend their time making fun memories, so make sure they get the time to do that at your rental by providing a cleaning service.\n\nAd hoc bookings may mean you don\u2019t need a regular service, so opt for one like SweepSouth, a handy on-demand home service that allows you to book reliable, trustworthy cleaners when you need them. Gardeners to spruce up your outside area can be booked on the site too.\n\nCreate a photo-worthy backdrop\n\nPeople love taking photos of themselves in a beautiful holiday setting and sharing them with those back home. Create an appealing photo-worthy scene in one of the main living spaces.\n\nIt can be a stylish area with smart wallpaper and an ornamental mirror, a serene space in the garden or quirky corner at the entrance featuring something that resonates with the location you\u2019re in, like a local artwork or an attractive grouping of photos of local landmarks.\n\nA bedroom sanctuary\n\nSpending time and effort on making your master bedroom into a tranquil sanctuary is well worth it. You want a guest to feel pampered the moment they walk in and see plush pillows and plump quilts on a big, comfy bed that promises a fantastic night\u2019s sleep.\n\nBuy the best mattress you can afford, and provide soft-to-the-touch quality linen and bedding.\n\nMake this haven of relaxation that much more luxurious with air-conditioning, block-out curtains or blinds, soft rugs and laundry hampers. Think about your guests\u2019 expectations and exceed them.\n\nLight it right\n\nDone right, lighting can add so much to the feel of a room. Fabulous lamps or wall sconces in the bedroom, charming pendants in the kitchen and a large standing lamp in the sitting room will add real presence.\n\nOutdoor delight\n\nIf you have an outdoor space, make it an oasis for guests to spend time in. Even small areas can be made delightful with the addition of water features, hammocks, daybeds and canopies. If you can care for it, plant a vegetable or herb patch that guests can help themselves to.\n\nPhoto perfect\n\nLastly, get great photos of your rental. When people scroll through listings on holiday accommodation sites, think about what your photos will look like and whether they\u2019ll catch the eye of a holidaymaker, resulting in more bookings. It\u2019s worth getting a professional in to take the shots when you first list.", "articleBodyHtml": "<article>\n\n<p>Anyone who has a holiday home or flat would love to have it fully booked all through the year.</p>\n\n<p>With travelling abroad still seen as risky, many Kenyans will be holidaying locally during the coming holidays instead of going overseas.</p>\n\n<p>How do you make your vacation rental stand out so that people notice it when they\u2019re booking online?

Try an online design programme like Canva to put your guide together and make it look professional.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Nobody wants ordinary\n</strong></p>\n\n<p>When you\u2019re decorating a space for holiday guests, it\u2019s tempting to tone it down so that the d\u00e9cor will appeal to all, but remember that people want wow. Guests want a space that feels like a home from home but they\u2019re also paying for an experience. Colour, beautiful art, a stand-out furniture piece, deep-pile rugs in the bedroom or a luxe addition like a log fireplace or a jacuzzi will be memorable (and romantic!).</p>\n\n<p>If your home is surrounded by beautiful scenery, invest in floor-length glass windows or doors for views that will really sell your holiday home. Never fall into the trap of choosing cheap d\u00e9cor items, or worse still, decorating a space with the things you don\u2019t want at home. Old, cheap and boring are to be avoided at all costs. When people walk into your holiday rental they want to find the equivalent, or better, than what they have at home.</p>\n\n<p><img src=\"https://www.nairobileo.co.ke/uploads/posts/IMG-20211215095821.JPG\"><br></p>\n\n<p><strong>What guests want\n</strong></p>\n\n<p>Evaluate every part of your holiday space and think about what you can do to make your guests\u2019 experience memorable. The living room must have a cosy place where they can relax and read a book or watch a movie and, if possible, a smart TV.</p>\n\n<p>In the kitchen, make sure there\u2019s everything that guests need to easily be able to self-cater. If you can, add in luxe touches such as an espresso machine or a smoothie maker. It\u2019s things like this people will tell their friends about.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Superior service\n</strong></p>\n\n<p>Holidaymakers want to relax and spend their time making fun memories, so make sure they get the time to do that at your rental by providing a cleaning service.</p>\n\n<p>Ad hoc bookings may mean you don\u2019t need a regular service, so opt for one like SweepSouth, a handy on-demand home service that allows you to book reliable, trustworthy cleaners when you need them. Gardeners to spruce up your outside area can be booked on the site too.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Create a photo-worthy backdrop\n</strong></p>\n\n<p>People love taking photos of themselves in a beautiful holiday setting and sharing them with those back home. Create an appealing photo-worthy scene in one of the main living spaces.</p>\n\n<p>It can be a stylish area with smart wallpaper and an ornamental mirror, a serene space in the garden or quirky corner at the entrance featuring something that resonates with the location you\u2019re in, like a local artwork or an attractive grouping of photos of local landmarks.</p>\n\n<p><strong>A bedroom sanctuary\n</strong></p>\n\n<p>Spending time and effort on making your master bedroom into a tranquil sanctuary is well worth it. You want a guest to feel pampered the moment they walk in and see plush pillows and plump quilts on a big, comfy bed that promises a fantastic night\u2019s sleep.</p>\n\n<p>Buy the best mattress you can afford, and provide soft-to-the-touch quality linen and bedding.</p>\n\n<p>Make this haven of relaxation that much more luxurious with air-conditioning, block-out curtains or blinds, soft rugs and laundry hampers. Think about your guests\u2019 expectations and exceed them.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Light it right\n</strong></p>\n\n<p>Done right, lighting can add so much to the feel of a room. Fabulous lamps or wall sconces in the bedroom, charming pendants in the kitchen and a large standing lamp in the sitting room will add real presence.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Outdoor delight\n</strong></p>\n\n<p>If you have an outdoor space, make it an oasis for guests to spend time in. Even small areas can be made delightful with the addition of water features, hammocks, daybeds and canopies. If you can care for it, plant a vegetable or herb patch that guests can help themselves to.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Photo perfect\n</strong></p>\n\n<p>Lastly, get great photos of your rental. When people scroll through listings on holiday accommodation sites, think about what your photos will look like and whether they\u2019ll catch the eye of a holidaymaker, resulting in more bookings. It\u2019s worth getting a professional in to take the shots when you first list.</p>\n\n</article>", "canonicalUrl": "https://www.nairobileo.co.ke/business/5521/10-ways-to-make-sure-your-vacation-rental-stands-out"},{"url": "https://www.nairobileo.co.ke/news/5505/high-court-suspends-govt-directive-denying-unvaccinated-people-basic-services", "probability": 0.974542, "headline": "High Court Suspends Govt Directive Denying Unvaccinated People Basic Services", "datePublished": "2021-12-14T09:33:32.449931", "datePublishedRaw": "1 day ago", "author": "Ondieki Rogito", "authorsList": ["Ondieki Rogito"], "inLanguage": "en", "breadcrumbs": [{"name": "Home", "link": "https://www.nairobileo.co.ke/"}, {"name": "News", "link": "https://www.nairobileo.co.ke/news"}, {"name": "High Court Suspends Govt Directive Denying Unvaccinated People Basic Services"}], "mainImage": "https://www.nairobileo.co.ke/uploads/posts/IMG-20210301191355.jpg", "images": ["https://www.nairobileo.co.ke/uploads/posts/IMG-20210301191355.jpg"], "description": "CS Kagwe had on November 21, announced that those who would not be vaccinated by December 22, will not receive govt services", "articleBody": "The High Court of Kenya has suspended a directive barring Kenyans from accessing government services unless they are vaccinated.\n\nJustice Anthony Murima issued the conservatory order this Tuesday, December 14, after a case was filed by Enock Aura through lawyer Harrison Kinyanjui.\n\nLawyer Kinyajui in his presentation argued that the directive would bar thousands of Kenyans from accessing the services given that many had not taken the jab.\n\nThe lawyer told the court that Kenyans are the ones funding the government services hence it is irrational to be denied because of the Covid-19 jab.\n\nHealth Cabinet Secretary Mutahi Kagwe had on November 21, announced that those who would not be vaccinated by December 22, will not receive govt services.\n\nThe services include but are not limited to KRA services, Education, Immigration services, Hospital and Prison Visitations, NTSA and port services among others.", "articleBodyHtml": "<article>\n\n<p>The High Court of Kenya has suspended a directive barring Kenyans from accessing government services unless they are vaccinated.</p>\n\n<p>Justice Anthony Murima issued the conservatory order this Tuesday, December 14, after a case was filed by Enock Aura through lawyer Harrison Kinyanjui.</p>\n\n<p>Lawyer Kinyajui in his presentation argued that the directive would bar thousands of Kenyans from accessing the services given that many had not taken the jab.</p>\n\n<p>The lawyer told the court that Kenyans are the ones funding the government services hence it is irrational to be denied because of the Covid-19 jab.</p>\n\n<p>Health Cabinet Secretary Mutahi Kagwe had on November 21, announced that those who would not be vaccinated by December 22, will not receive govt services.</p>\n\n<p>The services include but are not limited to KRA services, Education, Immigration services, Hospital and Prison Visitations, NTSA and port services among others.</p>\n\n</article>", "canonicalUrl": "https://www.nairobileo.co.ke/news/5505/high-court-suspends-govt-directive-denying-unvaccinated-people-basic-services"},{"url": "https://www.nairobileo.co.ke/news/5526/psc-announces-massive-job-opportunities-how-to-apply", "probability": 0.9940387, "headline": "PSC Announces Massive Job Opportunities: How to Apply", "datePublished": "2021-12-15T09:10:32.661239", "datePublishedRaw": "23 minutes ago", "author": "Guest Writer", "authorsList": ["Guest Writer"], "inLanguage": "en", "breadcrumbs": [{"name": "Home", "link": "https://www.nairobileo.co.ke/"}, {"name": "News", "link": "https://www.nairobileo.co.ke/news"}, {"name": "PSC Announces Massive Job Opportunities: How to Apply"}], "mainImage": "https://www.nairobileo.co.ke/uploads/posts/IMG-20210914110033.PNG", "images": ["https://www.nairobileo.co.ke/uploads/posts/IMG-20210914110033.PNG", "https://www.nairobileo.co.ke/uploads/posts/IMG-20211215120804.jpg"], "description": "Public Service Commission (PSC) has advertised job opportunities and invited applications from qualified members of the public.\n\n", "articleBody": "Public Service Commission (PSC) has advertised job opportunities and invited applications from qualified members of the public.\n\nIn an advertisement on Wednesday, December 15, 2021, PSC announced that there are 745 vacancies to be filled.

Eight out of the 10 most streamed artists by this group are all rappers. After Drake, the second most popular rapper, and only female artist in the list, is Doja Cat.

Life and its challenges inspire her daily pursuits to be the best version of herself.\n\n\u201cMy purpose is to grow people, so I am constantly challenging people around me to be better versions of themselves. As I mentor others, I also learn from them and get mentored on the go. Away from work, I am an active sporty person who enjoys playing golf. Occasionally, you will find me making a sumptuous meal for my family,\u201d She said.\n\nThroughout her working life, Jane has served in various senior management positions across diverse sectors; fast-moving consumer goods, telecommunications and Non-Profit sectors. In this interview, we sit down with Jane to learn more about her journey and some of the lessons we can pick from her polished career life.\n\n1. You have a polished career journey; kindly highlight some of your significant achievements and the surrounding events?\n\nI am a great believer that the foundation a parent sets for their child is important. A good education is the foundation of a progressive career, and leadership begins at home, then it is cultivated in school; primary, secondary and university.\n\nI am, therefore, grateful to my parents, who were great cheerleaders. They pushed my siblings and I to attain a decent education, which made us dream big. They also disciplined us, which we only appreciated in hindsight.\n\nLife has taught me that success is embedded in being disciplined, besides finding the right fit in terms of a workplace and being in the right organisation that trains someone to grasp the requisite skills.\n\nJane Karuku, the Group Managing Director and Chief Executive Officer at East African Breweries Limited.\n\nMy entry into the world of work began at Kenya Co-Operative Creameries Limited (KCC) as a management trainee. This was where I learnt the virtue of work ethics. Shortly afterwards, I became a mother and took a career break to raise my family. I have two children whom I am proud and fond of. During this period, I enrolled for an MBA in the United States, an experience that enhanced my self-confidence by virtue that I could cope with both parenting and schooling.\n\nUpon completion of my studies, I returned to Kenya and served as a Brand Manager. After which, I went back to serve as an Operations Manager. I was only 30 years old. My goal was to sharpen my leadership skills. It was a tough job, and I had to think through the change management process. I wanted to make a mark but knew acceptability was a challenge.\n\nI struggled with acceptability for a while. But I knew we had to do something. So we opted to bring in some vibrancy through our paintwork. And we achieved our goal. We sent a message that things were changing.\n\nThe factory had no women employees, so we began recruiting some. Then the culture at the factory transformed. With time, I learnt the challenges that plagued the factory; health and sanitation were a priority. So I addressed the dietary challenges by changing the menu at the canteen and the staff\u2019s uniforms. These brought a turnaround to the factory. Believe me or not, this simple gesture increased productivity. By the time I left, we had achieved splendid success.\n\nThat experience affirmed that as a leader, it is important to endeavour to embrace your unique gifts as a woman. I knew early on that the success factor was not how I would draw strategies for the business; anyone can do that. But the success factor is in how I am accepted as a leader and the influence I have on my team.\n\nThis is key for any leader because you can\u2019t lead if you have no followers. So my strategy was listening to the staff and ensuring that I met them halfway. In turn, they became my biggest supporters and fans.\n\nAfter five years, I progressed to Managing Director East and Central Africa at Cadbury\u2019s. I served in this capacity for 13 years; before the company was acquired globally. So I left for Telkom, Kenya, where I worked for three years before moving to the Alliance for a Green Revolution in Africa (AGRA). It was during this time that I joined the EABL Board. Soon after that, an opportunity to serve as KBL Managing Director came, and I took it with a stride. This year, I got an opportunity to transition to EABL\u2019s Group MD and CEO.\n\nI have enjoyed working for EABL. We have a team of great people, great brands, and most importantly, we are proud of our role in society. If we think about ourselves from grain to glass, we have over 60,000 farmers who are our suppliers and an ambitious target to buy 80 per cent of our raw materials locally. With more than 2,500 workers and seven factories across East Africa, EABL contributes about 1 percent of Kenya\u2019s GDP, which is no small fete.\n\nFrom a capitalisation perspective, EABL has been one of the top five companies in the region in the last five years, and we are the number one excise duty taxpayer in Kenya. Diversity and inclusion is a value we champion for by endeavouring to promote gender equity.\n\nWe are keen on having a role modelling mentorship programme. This is a powerful way to empower young men and women into leadership and empower them to overcome unconscious bias.\n\nFor me, serving at EABL is a calling. This is a business that is integrated to improve the lives of the communities we operate in. When you work at EABL, you work for more than a salary because we serve a considerable ecosystem; from the farmers who provide oats and barley, the bar owners and distributors, and butchery guy and mama mbogas who sell the ingredients that make a delicious meal that many people prefer to take before consuming alcohol.\n\nAll these are people that EABL has a direct impact on their livelihoods, and they are also employing others along the way and contributing to the growth of the economy. It is an absolute honour to serve at EABL.\n\n2. Please share with us some key lessons that you have learnt along the way as a woman in Senior Management through your experience in diverse sectors; fast-moving Consumer goods, Telecommunications and Non-Profit sectors.\n\nI am a leader, and whenever I take up a role, I do it gender blind. I don\u2019t take up a role thinking that I am a woman. I am a leader, fullstop. If you think of yourself as a woman leader rather than simply a leader, you are likely to self-sabotage. And many things sabotage women as they go up the career ladder. Some of them include:\n\nI. Unconscious bias- Sometimes, women write themselves off from working in specific industries because they think those are a preserve for men.\n\nII. Recruiting bias- Organisational leadership can be biased when hiring leadership roles by going for people who look like them, and often it is likely to be a man. At EABL, we train all departments on unconscious bias. We have also been intentional about diversity and inclusion and given departments targets. For example, we hope to achieve a 50/50 hiring threshold by 2025. This doesn\u2019t mean we are going to hire incompetent people in the name of gender equity. Diversity and inclusion are critical for us because our consumers are 50 per cent female and 50 per cent male, and this also needs to be reflected in our staffing.\n\nIII. Lack of mentorship. Mentorship helps to grow talent. A good mentor will tell you off and encourage you in equal measure. My encouragement to women is to seek mentors but also mentor other people. I am intentional about mentorship and do it for individuals and groups, both within EABL and outside the organisation. By being intentional about mentorship, I have learnt that;\n\n\uf0fc Mentoring is always around you. If you look keenly, you will see it. Still, sometimes it also happens without your awareness-it is situational, e.g. from a waiter/caddie who is passionate about their job or even an employee who is very self-driven.\n\n\uf0fc There\u2019s always someone who is better than you. As a mentee, you must open yourself to learning from others and be careful about being decisive on what aspects you would like to be mentored on. Here is the reason.\n\nWe all have blind spots, and other people can see areas you need mentorship in. But if you are too rigid, you may miss out on that. In addition, your own judgment may not be accurate, so emotional intelligence is important and the need to be open to feedback.\n\n\uf0fc So many people want mentorship but are they ready for it? Sometimes when you give people mentorship with sincerity, they say you are too rough. Mentorship is complicated because it is candid feedback, and many of us have grown up struggling with receiving feedback.\n\n3. Using your own life experience, are there any lessons on encouraging women to a greater awareness that they can break barriers, influence, and occupy decision-making positions?\n\na). As a woman, you must equip yourself with the proper competencies. Learning and self-growth is continuous process. As a minority group, women are constantly faced with challenges, and some are cultural barriers. This means you will have to work harder than your male counterparts. Don\u2019t expect to work the same way as the menfolk and expect recognition.\n\nb). Learn to grow your influence. This is a style I have adopted over time. I am open, and I talk to everyone rather than building hierarchical walls around me. It allows me to have greater influence in a subtle and non-threatening way. You also get to learn about what is going on in an organisation.\n\nc). Cultivate high emotional intelligence. Women get tripped a lot and judged because of low emotional intelligence. Develop high emotional intelligence so that you do not get discredited because of your emotions. Remember, leadership is about capability, knowing what to do, and the competence to drive an organisation. And this you can only achieve by your ability to influence and gain followers. Women should strive to be credible by being authentic, self-aware, capable, and having a high IQ.\n\nd). Have a feedback mechanism with people you trust who will give you feedback on the go so that you know how you are doing. Feedback differs from noise, and the biggest differentiator is that feedback helps you achieve your strategy while noise is a distraction. If it does not align with your development agenda and does not add value to improve our results, then learn to ignore it; that\u2019s noise.\n\ne). Encourage working in teams, it brings diversity and with the benefit of many minds you get new and excellent ideas. As you do that, build trust across the spheres of influence. Always seek to remain authentic.\n\n4. Well, yours is a polished career life. You have earned some wisdom along your journey. What lessons do you have for the younger generation who are starting off their career journey? What life nuggets must they be alive to?\n\nThere are so many, but the ones that come top of my mind are:\n\n\uf076 Never stop learning. You can never \u201darrive\u201d in life. Life is a lifelong learning process, and you need to build your competencies all the time.\n\n\uf076 Build teams around you. It is impossible to achieve success in anything by yourself. Surround yourself with people who are better than you and work together to achieve the goals you desire.\n\n\uf076 Be a whole person. There are many aspects about you. Strive to embrace them all and be comfortable in your skin.\n\n5. Kindly share with us some of your key life values that guide the way you live and work.\n\n\uf076 Humility. It keeps me grounded so that I am not caught up chasing after titles. You know, most of us spend time on the roles we play other than who we really are and the things that matter to us in life.\n\n\uf076 Authenticity. Being authentic helps us to be true to ourselves. I do not get stressed about what I say so that I can keep up with it. When it comes to Jane Karuku, what you see is what you get, in all sense.\n\nAny parting shot?\n\nI want to remind women that we should not wait for a license to operate. Nobody owes us anything, so we need to learn to take up opportunities that bring us to the decision-making tables.\n\nBegin by equipping yourself from a competence perspective; technical and leadership. Then get a mentor or a coach to affirm you. Finally, and this is very critical. Do your best to live a balanced life. In most instances, if you are not comfortable with certain aspects of your life, you can easily sabotage yourself at work, hence the need to always find a balance. With every role you play in life, do not think of yourself as a woman first, but always strive to have people see you as a leader who happens to be a woman.\n\nWomen have always played a very significant role in our lives since time immemorial. Most of us can attest to having a grandmother, whether literate or illiterate, who was/is very important in their lives. In many homes, grandmothers were the most powerful women. They made decisions for their families. This just attests that women are natural leaders. Therefore, let\u2019s strive to see leadership from our ability to influence. We, therefore, collectively as women, need to own and be proud of our innate power. We are capable, and yes, we can.", "articleBodyHtml": "<article>\n\n<p>In our segment of #KenyaWomenSeries, we feature, Jane Karuku,\u00a0the Group Managing Director and Chief Executive Officer at East African Breweries Limited (EABL).</p>\n\n<p>Jane, who considers herself very passionate about life, is action and results-oriented.

If we think about ourselves from grain to glass, we have over 60,000 farmers who are our suppliers and an ambitious target to buy 80 per cent of our raw materials locally. With more than 2,500 workers and seven factories across East Africa, EABL contributes about 1 percent of Kenya\u2019s GDP, which is no small fete.</p>\n\n<p>From a capitalisation perspective, EABL has been one of the top five companies in the region in the last five years, and we are the number one excise duty taxpayer in Kenya. Diversity and inclusion is a value we champion for by endeavouring to promote gender equity.</p>\n\n<p>We are keen on having a role modelling mentorship programme. This is a powerful way to empower young men and women into leadership and empower them to overcome unconscious bias.</p>\n\n<p>For me, serving at EABL is a calling. This is a business that is integrated to improve the lives of the communities we operate in. When you work at EABL, you work for more than a salary because we serve a considerable ecosystem; from the farmers who provide oats and barley, the bar owners and distributors, and butchery guy and mama mbogas who sell the ingredients that make a delicious meal that many people prefer to take before consuming alcohol.</p>\n\n<p>All these are people that EABL has a direct impact on their livelihoods, and they are also employing others along the way and contributing to the growth of the economy. It is an absolute honour to serve at EABL.</p>\n\n<p>2.<strong>\tPlease share with us some key lessons that you have learnt along the way as a woman in Senior Management through your experience in diverse sectors; fast-moving Consumer goods, Telecommunications and Non-Profit sectors.\n</strong></p>\n\n<p>I am a leader, and whenever I take up a role, I do it gender blind. I don\u2019t take up a role thinking that I am a woman. I am a leader, fullstop.  If you think of yourself as a woman leader rather than simply a leader, you are likely to self-sabotage. And many things sabotage women as they go up the career ladder. Some of them include:</p>\n\n<p>I.\tUnconscious bias- Sometimes, women write themselves off from working in specific industries because they think those are a preserve for men.</p>\n\n<p>II.\tRecruiting bias- Organisational leadership can be biased when hiring leadership roles by going for people who look like them, and often it is likely to be a man.  At EABL, we train all departments on unconscious bias. We have also been intentional about diversity and inclusion and given departments targets. For example, we hope to achieve a 50/50 hiring threshold by 2025. This doesn\u2019t mean we are going to hire incompetent people in the name of gender equity. Diversity and inclusion are critical for us because our consumers are 50 per cent female and 50 per cent male, and this also needs to be reflected in our staffing.</p>\n\n<p>III.\tLack of mentorship. Mentorship helps to grow talent. A good mentor will tell you off and encourage you in equal measure. My encouragement to women is to seek mentors but also mentor other people. I am intentional about mentorship and do it for individuals and groups, both within EABL and outside the organisation. By being intentional about mentorship, I have learnt that;</p>\n\n<p>\uf0fc\tMentoring is always around you. If you look keenly, you will see it. Still, sometimes it also happens without your awareness-it is situational, e.g. from a waiter/caddie who is passionate about their job or even an employee who is very self-driven.</p>\n\n<p>\uf0fc\tThere\u2019s always someone who is better than you. As a mentee, you must open yourself to learning from others and be careful about being decisive on what aspects you would like to be mentored on.  Here is the reason.</p>\n\n<p>We all have blind spots, and other people can see areas you need mentorship in. But if you are too rigid, you may miss out on that. In addition, your own judgment may not be accurate, so emotional intelligence is important and the need to be open to feedback.</p>\n\n<p><img src=\"https://www.nairobileo.co.ke/uploads/posts/IMG-20211103230132.jpeg\"><br></p>\n\n<p>\uf0fc\tSo many people want mentorship but are they ready for it? Sometimes when you give people mentorship with sincerity, they say you are too rough. Mentorship is complicated because it is candid feedback, and many of us have grown up struggling with receiving feedback.</p>\n\n<p>3.\t<em>Using your own life experience, are there any lessons on encouraging women to a greater awareness that they can break barriers, influence, and occupy decision-making positions?\n</em></p>\n\n<p>a). As a woman, you must equip yourself with the proper competencies. Learning and self-growth is continuous process. As a minority group, women are constantly faced with challenges, and some are cultural barriers. This means you will have to work harder than your male counterparts. Don\u2019t expect to work the same way as the menfolk and expect recognition.</p>\n\n<p>b). Learn to grow your influence. This is a style I have adopted over time. I am open, and  I talk to everyone rather than building hierarchical walls around me. It allows me to have greater influence in a subtle and non-threatening way. You also get to learn about what is going on in an organisation.</p>\n\n<p>c). Cultivate high emotional intelligence. Women get tripped a lot and judged because of low emotional intelligence. Develop high emotional intelligence so that you do not get discredited because of your emotions. Remember, leadership is about capability, knowing what to do, and the competence to drive an organisation. And this you can only achieve by your ability to influence and gain followers. Women should strive to be credible by being authentic, self-aware, capable, and having a high IQ.</p>\n\n<p>d). Have a feedback mechanism with people you trust who will give you feedback on the go so that you know how you are doing. Feedback differs from noise, and the biggest differentiator is that feedback helps you achieve your strategy while noise is a distraction. If it does not align with your development agenda and does not add value to improve our results, then learn to ignore it; that\u2019s noise.</p>\n\n<p>e). Encourage working in teams, it brings diversity and with the benefit of many minds you get new and excellent ideas. As you do that, build trust across the spheres of influence. Always seek to remain authentic.</p>\n\n<p>4.<em><strong> Well, yours is a polished career life. You have earned some wisdom along your journey. What lessons do you have for the younger generation who are starting off their career journey? What life nuggets must they be alive to?\n</strong></em></p>\n\n<p>There are so many, but the ones that come top of my mind are:</p>\n\n<p>\uf076\tNever stop learning. You can never \u201darrive\u201d in life. Life is a lifelong learning process, and you need to build your competencies all the time.</p>\n\n<p>\uf076\tBuild teams around you. It is impossible to achieve success in anything by yourself. Surround yourself with people who are better than you and work together to achieve the goals you desire.</p>\n\n<p>\uf076\tBe a whole person. There are many aspects about you. Strive to embrace them all and\u00a0be comfortable in your skin.</p>\n\n<figure><img src=\"https://www.nairobileo.co.ke/uploads/posts/IMG-20211103230628.jpeg\"></figure>\n\n<p>5.\t<strong>Kindly share with us some of your key life values that guide the way you live and work.  \n</strong></p>\n\n<p>\uf076\tHumility. It keeps me grounded so that I am not caught up chasing after titles. You know, most of us spend time on the roles we play other than who we really are and the things that matter to us in life.</p>\n\n<p>\uf076\tAuthenticity. Being authentic helps us to be true to ourselves. I do not get stressed about what I say so that I can keep up with it. When it comes to Jane Karuku, what you see is what you get, in all sense.</p>\n\n<p><em>Any parting shot?\n</em></p>\n\n<p>I want to remind women that we should not wait for a license to operate. Nobody owes us anything, so we need to learn to take up opportunities that bring us to the decision-making tables.</p>\n\n<p>Begin by equipping yourself from a competence perspective; technical and leadership. Then get a mentor or a coach to affirm you. Finally, and this is very critical. Do your best to live a balanced life. In most instances, if you are not comfortable with certain aspects of your life, you can easily sabotage yourself at work, hence the need to always find a balance. With every role you play in life, do not think of yourself as a woman first, but always strive to have people see you as a leader who happens to be a woman.</p>\n\n<p>Women have always played a very significant role in our lives since time immemorial.  Most of us can attest to having a grandmother, whether literate or illiterate, who was/is very important in their lives. In many homes, grandmothers were the most powerful women. They made decisions for their families. This just attests that women are natural leaders. Therefore, let\u2019s strive to see leadership from our ability to influence. We, therefore, collectively as women, need to own and be proud of our innate power. We are capable, and yes, we can.</p>\n\n</article>", "canonicalUrl": "https://www.nairobileo.co.ke/opinions/4925/inspiring-story-of-jane-karuku-kenyan-woman-spearheading-east-african-breweries-limited"},{"url": "https://www.nairobileo.co.ke/opinions/4588/jacqueline-mugo-ex-magistrate-who-ditched-judiciary-to-become-voice-of-kenyan-employers", "probability": 0.98757076, "headline": "Jacqueline Mugo: Ex-Magistrate Who Ditched Judiciary to Become Voice of Kenyan Employers", "datePublished": "2021-10-15T09:34:08.001305", "datePublishedRaw": "2 months ago", "author": "Nairobi Leo", "authorsList": ["Nairobi Leo"], "inLanguage": "en", "breadcrumbs": [{"name": "Home", "link": "https://www.nairobileo.co.ke/"}, {"name": "Opinions", "link": "https://www.nairobileo.co.ke/opinions"}, {"name": "Jacqueline Mugo: Ex-Magistrate Who Ditched Judiciary to Become Voice of Kenyan Employers"}], "mainImage": "https://www.nairobileo.co.ke/uploads/posts/IMG-20211006233351.JPG", "images": ["https://www.nairobileo.co.ke/uploads/posts/IMG-20211006233351.JPG", "https://www.nairobileo.co.ke/uploads/posts/IMG-20211006233501.jpeg", "https://www.nairobileo.co.ke/uploads/posts/IMG-20211006233420.jpeg", "https://www.nairobileo.co.ke/uploads/posts/IMG-20211006233439.jpeg"], "description": "In our segment of #KenyaWomenSeries, we feature, Jacqueline Mugo.

An advocate who doubles up as the Executive Director & CEO of the Federation of Kenya Employers, the Secretary-General Business Africa Employers Confederation, a Titular Board member of the Governing Body of the International Labour Organization (ILO) and the Vice President for Africa of the International Organization of Employers (IOE).\n\n1. You are an advocate of the high court, how did you settle into Human Resource and Labour Relations.\n\nMy journey as an advocate of the high court was full of ups and downs and lots of changes. When in school I didn\u2019t want to study law. I resisted for a while. Later, I realized it is a foundation that opens many possibilities. During my elective class on Labour Law which many of us were not interested in, my interest picked when the lecturer talked about the interplay between business and workers and how multinationals were ripping off locals.\n\nThe impact of this on people\u2019s lives made me interested. I chose Labour Law as one of my elective subjects to seek an understanding of business law among other facets of law. This was the beginning of interest in labour and employment matters. However, when I finished my studies, I worked in the Criminal Law in the Judiciary.\n\nFrom the onset, I had decided that I would not do just one thing in life. I didn\u2019t want my career life summed up as having been a magistrate, judge and then passed on. I wanted to do so many things. After 7yrs working at the Judiciary, I got the call to join the Federation of Kenya Employers (FKE), the national umbrella body and the voice of employers in Kenya.\n\nThe move was a rude shock, because when on the bench your word is the law. You set the mood and drive the affairs. But at FKE it was more of social dialogue, which is where my interest in Labour Relations was honed. I worked here before moving into the private sector. My exposure to Labour Relations and my background in law, made me realize that there was a connection between the law and human relations. So, I went into the Private sector to practice HR for about seven years to get the human interconnection.\n\nFile image of Jacqueline Mugo\n\n2. You are very passionate about Industrial Relations, employment and employers\u2019 issues. What spurred your interest in this field, and what do you consider as some of your most successful career moments and the events that have shaped these?\n\nAt the Judiciary, I was perceived as tough but fair. Being fair is a value I uphold - Fairness and Justice. This was positive feedback from those I was serving. It prepared me for the new world of FKE, transitioning from the bench to the bar where I had to use persuasion, social dialogue and accommodate different views. The transition was a milestone that enabled me to negotiate many Collective Bargaining Agreements and achieve outcomes in the cases I was handling.\n\nThe shift also from the Federation into the private sector, settling with multinationals to understand their work culture work, key performance indicators and focus on delivery and presentations was also a transition point. Then finally back to FKE now at the helm of the organization.\n\nI believe the capacity to adapt, accommodate change, remain focused and consistently deliver is one of my achievements. I build many networks and friends that gave me opportunities to speak in many high-level forums, chairing global meetings and passing interventions where presidents were present. The capacity to adapt and remain focused in leadership is yet another achievement; being able to work with people to deliver results either in departments or in the roles that I play in FKE, regionally and internationally. Delivering through people is one thing I am also proud of.\n\nWe are proud of the role that the Federation has played in the advancement of women and building the capacity of women to take up leadership positions in all spheres of their lives. FKE has been involved in international debates on gender equality, standards that discourage discrimination, harassment to create a more conducive environment for women to work globally. FKE started the Female Future program to develop the capacity of women in Kenya because of the opportunity the 2010 Constitution presented for women. It helps women to understand how they are put together, their strengths, how can they lead and present their case credibly and convincingly. It equips women with presentation skills, gives them the competence to operate at the board level and builds their capacity as leaders. FKE has so far graduated over 300 women to date.\n\n3. a) Y ou also play various roles in the regional and international scene, what has been your experience as a CEO? What has made you successful?\n\nPart of the success I have been privileged and honoured to experience is derived from the love of what I do. It has its challenges, but I am in it, I am present in it. I do not doubt that this is what I should be doing at this point in my life. Internal settlement of the position you hold is very important. Then the capacity to accommodate views, interpersonal relationships because you meet many people with divergent views.\n\nb) What challenges you have faced in the position and how have you sustained the momentum, remaining true and consistent in your leadership style even earning you global recognition and respect.\n\nI have faced many challenges in my career. As a young mother, I wanted to stay home and work part-time. This option was not available to me at the time. I loved my career and so balancing the career front, motherhood, combined with the transitions was difficult. Sometimes, I faced resistance where there was a bit of chauvinism particularly with Union representatives who thought I had little experience.\n\nThe dynamism of the corporate world was equally an enormous challenge, dealing with retrenchments and exiting people from work was difficult. The career transitions have not been easy much as they have given me many opportunities to grow.\n\nIn my role as a leader here at FKE, there have been challenges, going against proposals by policymakers because of their impact on employers. There is political pressure at all levels to pass resolutions to support projects that may not benefit employers or may increase the cost of doing business irrationally. You may feel isolated sometimes, because of the stands you have to take. At the end of the day, I am reminded that I am an advocate on behalf of employers.\n\n4. What role has the following impacted your career life?\n\n\u2022 Mentorship. This has pushed me into roles I didn\u2019t want to take up. One of them was when I was transiting from what I thought was a big change. When taking on the role of leadership at FKE, I had another offer that was a regional role. One of my mentors asked me how many women CEOs do you know in Kenya? How many CEOs of employers\u2019 organizations are there in Kenya? They nudged me to take up this unique opportunity and continued to walk with me. Mentors continue to play an important role in my personal and my working life.\n\n\u2022 Personal Branding. I tie this to how I perceive the world, why I do what I do and what drives me. I have a passion for what I do. Show courage in the face of fear. Most of the opportunities and leadership roles require that you learn by doing!\n\n\u2022 Taking up new challenges. These are there daily. Step into the space, take in challenges, into new situations and various leadership roles. I have taken in roles in the continent; to lead employers in the continent as a Secretary-General voluntarily. At the international level, I took on a role within the global employers body and ILO where labour policies are formed. This was a learning opportunity for me. New challenges come in different ways but if you are open to learning, then you will make it.\n\n5. What do you think it takes to be a successful women leader? Do you see opportunities within the environment here in Kenya/Africa? What would you advise women to do to take up these opportunities?\n\nLeadership is something that you grow into. A leader must have passion and clarity of vision on what it is you want to achieve. You need to know what your gifts are so that you can build a team around you to fill the gaps because nobody is perfect. It means you can draw the commitment of your team to walk alongside you and achieve the organizational goals.\n\nLeadership is about being a first among equals and being able to inspire your team to deliver and commit to the long-term vision of the organization.\n\nThere are many opportunities for leadership for women. Women make outstanding leaders. They need to step up and take their position and remove some stereotypes that have been - women don\u2019t support one another, women are emotional. That\u2019s not true, women lead differently because we are women.\n\nI am now contributing to a global debate that is looking at coming up with an international standard on women, gender equality and fundamental rights for women so that we open spaces for women globally. Even developed nations still have a lot of drawbacks for women to lead. The world cannot be led by men alone and that women have done very well. It is a privilege for me to be a woman leader today and to pave way for future generations.\n\nFile image of Jacqueline Mugo\n\n6. If you were to choose two values that are most important to you that shape the way you work and live, what would they be and why?\n\n\uf0fc Faith and Hope because a human being is more than oneself. You need a higher power, a guide that you can rely upon beyond yourself. So faith and spirituality are very important. When I reach the end of my road, beyond my capacity when times are challenging, I turn to God for support and courage.\n\n\uf0fc Integrity is key so that you serve from a good heart, from a good intention, wanting the best for your team, the organization and the best input for all discussions.\n\nAny parting shot?\n\nLife is a gift, the opportunity to serve, to work and to lead is also a gift. Not everybody has the opportunity, so when it comes your way, you have to do your best. Shine where you are planted and give back so that at the end of your life you will die empty because you will have invested everything you have in terms of your skills, passion, knowledge, competencies joy of life in other people so that they can carry this life.\n\nMy appeal to everyone is to step up and do their best so that we can change the face of the industry, we can build wealth and be able to change lives which is ultimately the reason we exist.", "articleBodyHtml": "<article>\n\n<p>In our segment of #KenyaWomenSeries, we feature, Jacqueline Mugo.

She is the first and only Catholic nun/sister working at Daystar University in Kenya.\n\nProf. Agnes Lucy currently serves as the Director of Research and Graduate Studies, an Associate Professor of Communication and Media Studies. She is also the Chair of Daystar University Ethics Review Board .\n\nLando lives by the mantra; \u201cLove and serve where you are needed but not wanted and leave when you are wanted but not needed.\u201d She has an expansive wealth of experience in academia besides being a consistent writer who has been published widely in various journals.\n\n1. Briefly introduce yourself to us. Who is SR. Prof Agnes Lucy Lando?\n\nI am a Catholic nun belonging to the Missionary Institute of the Sisters of Mary of Kakamega. My three names are all special to me; Agnes is my baptismal name, Lucy my confirmation name and Lando in my culture means brown complexion.\n\nAcademically, I am a top-grade scholar of Communications and Media Studies having had the rare opportunity to study in world-class universities. Both my undergraduate and Master\u2019s degrees are from Daystar having obtained a B.A in Audiovisual Productions and an M.A in Human and Intercultural Communication. My PhD is in Social Communication from The Pontifical Gregorian University, Rome, Italia. I am also the only Catholic nun with a PhD in Communications and Media Studies in Kenya, and perhaps in East Africa.\n\nBecause of my vast administration work experience, I am a hands-on and results oriented transformative leader, under the guidance of the Holy Spirit; and in practice, strive to observe Christian and work ethics, teamwork, and team spirit. In the face of challenges, I endure, guided by my life mantra: \u201cTo love and serve where you are needed but not wanted, and leave when you are wanted but not needed.\u201d I am a recipient of the 2013 George Gerbner Excellence Award.\n\nSince 15th June 2020, I am the incumbent Director of Research and Graduate Studies at Daystar University. I am also an Associate Professor of Communication and Media Studies, and the Chair of Daystar University Ethics Review Board (DU-ERB). Since I am very passionate about the profession, MA Communication students and I co-founded Master Communicators Welfare Association (MCWA) in 2013 which I am now the patroness. The association raises funds for financially challenged but academically able MA Communications students. Today, more than 10 students have received a scholarship through the association. (Well done!)\n\nAt the core of the Directorate of Research and Graduate Studies (DRGS) is the dream of fostering world-class, value-based scholars, research, and publications through advancing innovative ethical scholarship. Immediately after my appointment, I managed to secure a broad-based collaboration with the Kenya Film Commission (KFC) that resulted in two research studies.\n\nSr. Prof. Agnes Lucy Lando\n\n2. Talk to us about your career journey highlighting the significant achievements and the events around them? How have you managed to rise to the management level? What is your story?\n\nMy academic scholarship and mentorship efforts have been recognized by the prestigious International Communication Association. Hence in October 2016, I was elected the first African to the position of Board of Directors, the first African to hold such a position in the over 60 years old Association. This academic association is headquartered in Washington DC and every year I sit in the Board of Governors meeting to plan and offer direction to the Association for scholars interested in the study, teaching, and application of all aspects of human and mediated communication.\n\nAdditionally, I am a vivid fundraiser who has managed to raise funds for international (academic) conferences and research training workshops in support of graduate students and early-career scholars from Africa. These have been held in Kenya (Nairobi at Daystar University, 2016, Uganda (Entebbe, in 2017), and Ghana (Accra, in 2018). Excluding other monies raised from the Conference, I managed to have ICA send over USD 45, 000 for the mentioned conferences and training sessions.\n\nBecause of my direct involvement with ICA, a number of graduate students and early career scholars from Africa do access conference registration waivers, partial travel grants and secure affordable accommodation in Europe, Asia or North America during the annual ICA Conference. Between 2015-2019, almost USD 100, 000 has been spent on the partial travel grant and registration waiver on African delegates, which I facilitate.\n\nMy track-record has earned me appointments as an External Examiner in many Universities in Africa. I am also a Member of Council at \u2013 Tangaza University College (since 2020); and Council Academic Chair \u2013 Tangaza University College (since 2020) and also served as a member of the Council of Uzima University of Health and Social Sciences. In 2019-2020 I served on the Nominating Committee - for the 2020 International Communication Association (ICA) Elections.\n\n3. You are lauded as widely published in the field of academia and in research and serve as a research consultant to key individuals and organizations in the region. Please share with us what your experience with research and publishing has been?\n\nBoth Research and publication are my passion. I have conducted research locally and internationally. With both, you require patience, dedication, and sacrifice.\n\nOver the years, I have published numerous publications in Communication Ethics, Higher Education in Africa, The Critical Role of Crisis Communication Plan in Corporations\u2019 Crises Preparedness, Communication Theory, Rumours on Social Media; and Kenya\u2019s subtle 2013 Post-Election Violence. I sit on the editorial Board of Francis and Taylor Publications of the Journal of Children, Adolescent and the Media (CAM), and as an Associate Editor of Frontier Communications.\n\n4. Based on your experience as a woman, what lessons have you learnt about dealing with unconscious bias, breaking barriers, influencing, and occupying decision-making positions?\n\nMy religious formation (as a sister) prepared me adequately for the REAL world that I would serve in. I have experienced both conscious and unconscious bias and successfully came through. I have done this through prayers and meditation. My day always starts and ends with prayers.\n\nRegarding barriers, I am a bold go-getter and so when I see an opportunity for my institution or for humanity, I will stretch myself to get it. For example, when I saw that the International Communication Association (ICA) is an excellent association, but Africans were literally not members, I stood up in Washington Seatle (USA) and questioned the lack of inclusion of those of us from an African background. That was the birth of the ICA-Africa. I ended up being elected to the board, thus the first African to sit on that coveted board.\n\nWith regard to occupying decision-making positions, one has to find his/her way there. It won\u2019t come on a silver platter! So, when you see an opportunity that fits you, go for it!\n\n5. None of us can achieve success without some help along the way. Is there a particular person(s) who you are grateful towards who held your hand along your career journey? Can you briefly share a story about that?\n\nYes, I am grateful to my three special mentors. They have literally played a huge role in making me who I am today.\n\nThe first one is my Spiritual Director who has journeyed with me for many years. He directs my spiritual life and offers much-needed counsel. He has taught me to give even when what I have is little and challenged me to help the youth, especially those branded as bad in society. In his words, \u201cToday\u2019s seeds, tomorrow\u2019s harvest.\u201d\n\nThe second person is the one who made me complete my Doctoral studies in a record of two and half years, instead of three. This scholar interviewed me when I was applying for my doctorate studies. He made me understand that Africa needed me after my Doctoral studies and I needed to complete my PhD within the given three years and return to Africa (Kenya) to serve. I promised I would do so without much thought. That promise would prick my heart and mind every day. It became my guide and motivation to focus and complete my studies.\n\nLastly, there is a Sister who has been part and parcel of my religious life. We joined the Congregation the same day and have journeyed together to-date. This is the sister who reminds me to live my vowed religious life. We pray together and encourage each other to stay on course.\n\n6. If you were to choose the two most important values that shape the way you live by and keep you grounded, what would they be and why?\n\n\uf0fc My religious devotion. On making the first religious vows, my institute requires that every Sister takes a devotion in the Church. My religious devotion is the Holy Cross and that guides my daily Christian life.\n\n\uf0fc Daily meditation. I begin and end my day with prayers followed by silent mediation. In the quiet of that moment, I hear God directing my thoughts and actions for the day.\n\n7. Tell us what role has each of the following aspects played in your career life, giving brief real-life experiences?\n\n\u2022 Pursuing your passion. I loved communication from childhood because my dad introduced us to radio as little children. So, it was my desire to be a communicator, even as a Sister. But before my superiors identified this talent and the passion in me, I had been trained and served in another field \u2013 Accountancy and Administration. Passion never dies. So, I have learnt to be patient. In all matters, God\u2019s timing is the best.\n\n\u2022 Forging networks. Who and what I am today is as a result of networks. No one can go it (life) alone. The networks I have established opened doors for collaborations. Because of my networks, I have traveled the globe. Thus, forging networks are key in one\u2019s advancement.\n\n\u2022 Taking risks. If you don\u2019t get out of your comfort zone you never learn new things, you don\u2019t encounter new experiences and your formation and transformation is slowed. Risks mould us for the next steps in life.\n\n\u2022 Mentorship. I believe, when you mentor or give, you gain because as you help you continue to learn. As the old adage goes, \u201ciron sharpens iron\u201d and I have been frequently sharpened by the mentorships I get involved in.\n\nAny parting shot?\n\nPerhaps one may ask, so how much does Sr. Prof. Lando earn, and how does she spend it? Well, I am paid well but I don't spend a single cent. I am a religious with vows of poverty, chastity, and obedience. So, my life directs that what I earn is surrendered to the Congregation, as all the other sisters do. So that\u2019s what I do. Then, the Congregational leadership provides for my needs. I don't lack, I have everything but OWN nothing. That's my life.\n\nThis interview has been challenging because I am a believer that \u201cwhatever is good MUST be done well but quietly\u201d. Talking about my achievements has been a very tall order but I truly hope it inspires someone.", "articleBodyHtml": "<article>\n\n<p>In our segment of #KenyaWomenSeries, we feature, Sr. Prof. Agnes Lucy Lando.\u00a0She is the first and only Catholic nun/sister working at Daystar University in Kenya.</p>\n\n<p>Prof. Agnes Lucy currently serves as the Director of Research and Graduate Studies, an Associate Professor of Communication and Media Studies.

Who is Bina Maseno?\n\nI am a passionate advocate for gender equality. I lost four friends I schooled and grew up with in Kayole. They had joined a gang. The dilapidated state of the environment I grew up in, fed my passion for community development at a very young age.\n\nAt the age of 23, I ventured into politics and ran for political office for the Member of County Assembly. It was quite a big risk taking a break from campus given that I was being supported financially to study as my parents could barely afford to support our education. My challenges and experiences while running for political office as a young woman inspired the founding of Badili Africa.\n\nBefore founding Badili Africa, I worked for International Foundation for Electoral Systems (IFES \u2013 Kenya). I was the program officer, contributing to the co-creation of programs and advocacy campaigns aimed at cultivating informed choices and active participation of women and youth in electoral processes. I had also worked as a journalist at K24 which gave me a unique opportunity of working with marginalized and underserved communities.\n\nb). The work you do at Badili Africa has been appreciated globally, what does this mean to you?\n\nAs a community mobilizer, facilitator, mentor, speaker, and moderator, it has been an honour to be invited to and take part in global discussions across initiatives like; the Obama Africa Leaders Program in South Africa, the Bill and Melinda Gates Goalkeepers in New York, USA, African Union regional meetings, United Nations Population Fund Africa and Women at Dev among others.\n\nThe exposure has enriched my perspective on African leadership and how our challenges are so interconnected and will need us to be intentional in building solidarity towards solving them. It has also expanded my leadership skills in governance, development and policymaking.\n\n2. A s a journalist and Communication Specialist walk us through your career journey, some of the events that have shaped it and your proud moments?\n\nMy journalism journey enriched my understanding of issues I have grown to be passionate about and exposed me to how social justice efforts, legislation, and politics can affect citizens\u2019 wellbeing.\n\nOne of my highlights was a story I focused on recognizing the important role the informal sector plays in our economy to encourage more young people to embrace and transform the sector as opposed to waiting for blue-collar jobs that are not easy to come by.\n\nThe World Bank\u2019s Kenya economic update estimates 800,000 youth reach working age annually yet only 50,000 new formal modern wage jobs are created. The Informal sector represents a whopping 82.7% of employment according to research by the Institute of Economic Affairs.\n\nI interviewed business owners of big and small enterprises in the informal sector majority of whom had abandoned their blue-collar jobs to run their businesses in the informal sector. The public received the story well. I remember receiving some calls and messages from some young people requesting to be connected with some of the business owners in the informal markets who had opportunities and they were absorbed.\n\n3. You ran for political office as a 23-year-old. Please paint a picture for us about your experience, some challenges you faced and three key lessons you learnt?\n\nNothing prepares you enough for the world of politics not even the workshops I attended. Campaigning was quite costly for me coupled with balancing political life with university studies and domestic responsibilities, dealing with self-identity issues, security issues, and electoral violence.\n\nThen there\u2019s the reality of losing the elections, the trauma that accompanies it, the struggle to find work opportunities because people are hesitant to employ a \u201cpolitician\u201d or the challenge of raising resources to start or resurrect a business after spending everything in the campaigns.\n\nElectoral violence remains a key deterrent to women participating in political leadership spaces. One time after addressing a crowd late in the evening, there was a commotion, and someone tried to pull down my skirt. I reported the matter the next day to the police and shared all the threats I had received through text messages. All they said was that was the nature of politics and that I should quit if I can\u2019t develop a thick skin. I reached out to the male politicians I knew at the time on the same matter. Their advice was mainly how I needed to learn real quick how to show my capacity for violence as a survival tactic.\n\nOne time, I had the honour of co-hosting Hon. Peter Kenneth in Embakasi central constituency when he was aspiring to be our President. The event was filled as we had put so much effort into mobilizing the masses for the day. In the middle of the speeches, my campaign manager alerted me that some goons were threatening to cause chaos because I did not pay them to allow the meeting to take place.\n\nI panicked but kept calm. The event was quite successful, and it gave my candidacy good visibility especially when Hon. Peter Kenneth drummed up support for me promising my constituents he\u2019d journey with me if they elected me to ensure our Constituency, Embakasi Central thrived like Gatanga which was leading at the time as the best performing constituency.\n\nNeedless to say, while the political leaders were exiting the scene, chaos erupted. Everything was destroyed, the seats, the tents and the public address system. A cost that I painfully had to bear given the limited resources I had as I had hired everything. Part of the crowd moved to my home nearby and began chanting that I share the money Hon. Kenneth had given me.\n\nI tried to explain he hadn\u2019t given me any resources, all in futility. They kept shouting \u201cPresident mzima hawezi enda bila kuacha za macho na tunasikia ako na doo mbaya na unataka kula peke yako\u201d . Translated to a \u201cwhole aspiring and rich President could not have left without giving you money that you want to eat alone.\u201d At the end of the day, I had to part with some resources.\n\nAltogether, running for office gave me a unique opportunity and in-depth understanding of the challenges affecting my community and how it is tied to our National and Global politics. Interacting with people\u2019s lived realities every day also opened my eyes to how certain groups are marginalized and underserved. These experiences have continued to fuel the work we do at Badili Africa.\n\nThree lessons learnt:\n\n\uf076 Introspect on why you are seeking power. Your \u201cWhy\u201d is what will keep you going despite the challenges you\u2019ll face. This question is about character and being honest with yourself. Power comes with great responsibility and it is the ultimate test of character.\n\n\uf076 Find mentors to guide you and sharpen your leadership skills. A mentor will help you accelerate your growth by helping you steer clear from some common pitfalls, distractions and obstacles all of which will save you time, resources and energy.\n\n\uf076 Start early on sharpening your leadership skills, enhancing your knowledge base, and building solidarity for the causes you want to champion.\n\n(b) Any political ambitions come 2022?\n\nNot now. Maybe in the future. At Badili Africa, we are currently strengthening the leadership capacities of some of our Chama women leaders who have expressed interest in running in the upcoming general elections and political party grassroots elections.\n\n4. As a Founder and Director of an organization that drives social change, tell us more about Badili Africa. What inspired you, what\u2019s your vision for it and what are some of the activities you are engaged in to help increase the number of young women who engage with political processes?\n\nAs earlier stated, my challenges and experiences running for political office as a 23-year-old inspired the founding of Badili Africa. During my political campaigns, I saw how the majority of my female peers were not interested in voting, attending political rallies, protesting about causes they cared about or writing about political issues let alone running for political office.\n\nI equally observed how politicians would leverage on grassroots women\u2019s networks majority of them organizing in Chamas to win their political seats but once the elections and transfers took place, these grassroots women leaders would start all over again and struggle to be listened to and recognized as stakeholders by the new leaders in office. Research in Kenya has also shown that the most disenfranchised lot is young women between 18-25 years who do not care much about politics and governance.\n\nSo at Badili Africa, we cultivate the political awareness and engagement of young women between the age of 16 \u2013 30 in Universities who are disenfranchised, disengaged and disillusioned by politics. We mobilize marginalized young women in the informal settlement whose poverty renders them invisible and voiceless and consequently leads to their routine exclusion from civic dialogues and the multiple political spaces created by the Constitution of Kenya.\n\nBadili Africa also nurtures and strengthens the leadership capacities of Chama women as pressure groups for demanding accountability on public service delivery and inclusion in decision-making processes. We also seek to end sexual and gender-based violence against women and girls as a key deterrent to them participating effectively in leadership spaces.\n\nBadili Africa envisions these that these women and girls begin to interface with, and understand the power structures and decision-making processes of government institutions and how they can affect these and influence plans, programs and policies in ways that prioritize their needs.\n\n5. Given an opportunity to re-imagine the world (for women and girls), is there is anything you would change? If yes, what will it be and why?\n\nYes. Women\u2019s voices and participation is still peripheral in our politics both locally and globally. Largely women comprise slightly over 50% of the population in Kenya, however, their participation in the electoral process does not reflect this demographic reality. A direct consequence of this has been a clear underrepresentation of women\u2019s issues at policy, legislation and national budget levels.\n\nI would love to see a world where women and girls\u2019 rise to take up leadership positions, government institutions, the private sector and civil society to transform the leadership sector.\n\n6. What does the future look like for women in politics? What is your take on levelling the ground? Please share your experience and aspirations with us.\n\nWe have a constitution that supports and enables gender equality and we all must do our part to support and push for its implementation and respect of the rule of law.\n\nWe must seek an end to violence against women in politics as it continues to be normalized as part of political practice in the contest for power but has severe impacts emotionally, physically and financially. We need to start nurturing young women\u2019s political ambition early. At Badili Africa, we are very deliberate in cultivating and strengthening young women\u2019s leadership capacities in varied ways to catalyze and lead positive change in their university spaces.\n\n7. Tell us what role has each of the following aspects played in your career life, giving a brief of your real-life experiences?\n\n\uf0d8 Mentorship. Everyone should have a mentor. As long as you are willing to learn there\u2019s always someone out there willing to hold your hand. Seek them out. Remember asking for help is not a sign of weakness but shows a level of honesty, vulnerability and desire to grow. I am a product of God\u2019s favour and all the mentors who continue to journey with me in my leadership journey.\n\n\uf0d8 Taking risks. As the saying goes, \u201cOnly those who dare to fail greatly can ever achieve greatly.\u201d Taking risks has allowed me to discover hidden and exceptional opportunities. However, I try to ensure when taking risks, I do not do so blindly. It is important to carefully consider the possible outcomes and think of ways to mitigate the impact of the negative ones.\n\n\uf0d8 Forging networks. This is not only about trading information but also serves as an avenue to create long-term relationships. As the saying goes, \u2018no man is an island because it takes collective efforts to achieve success in whichever arena you desire to grow in. It is important to network strategically with people who are relevant to whatever you\u2019re pursuing. I also study how I can contribute to their success as well in as much as I am benefitting from them.\n\n8. I f I was to choose the two most important values I\u2019d start with:\n\n\u2022 Integrity. We are in a society where compromise has become a norm. I believe the key to living a meaningful and fulfilling life is being honest with yourself, others and keeping your word in all areas of your life. Education and achievements can open doors, but it will take integrity and character to keep those doors open.\n\n\u2022 Teamwork. The art of working together to benefit the whole fuels my work every day and has contributed largely to my success both at a personal and organizational level.\n\n9. With the elections just around the corner what plans does Badili Africa have?\n\nThe majority of our target audience in universities and informal settlements belong to a cohort that will vote for the first time in the upcoming 2022 elections. Equally, Chama women organizing, and decision-making skills rarely translate to meaningful engagement or voice in political, economic or good governance platforms where they can influence basic public service provision and yet they bear the brunt of lack of access to these services and inclusion in decision-making processes hence the Chamas, to fill in gaps created by poor politics. Badili Africa will build the capacities of these demographics to participate effectively in electoral processes and make informed choices.\n\nWe are currently strengthening the capacities of some of our Chama women leaders who will run for office in the coming elections and political party grassroots elections. We are currently working on a research study that will be released early in the year on the electoral violence meted on different political actors during elections to inform electoral security interventions by the state and non-state actors.\n\nParting shot\n\nBe the change you want to see in your community, home, church, workplace, relationship. Don\u2019t just talk about what needs to happen, do something in your little ways. I saw a gap in the society and that is how Badili Africa was born and we are contributing in our small ways to having more Chama women and young women take part effectively in socio-economic and political processes.", "articleBodyHtml": "<article>\n\n<p>In our segment of #KenyaWomenSeries, we feature,\u00a0Bina Maseno, a gender equality advocate who grew up in Kayole and had to overcome all odds including disease, poverty, and crime to re-write the story of her life.</p>\n\n<p>Bina is the founder of Badili Africa, a Social Advocacy organisation that was born from her experience having run for a political office at the age of 23years.</p>\n\n<p><strong>1a). Who is Bina Maseno?\n</strong></p>\n\n<p>I am a passionate advocate for gender equality. I lost four friends I schooled and grew up with in Kayole. They had joined a gang. The dilapidated state of the environment I grew up in, fed my passion for community development at a very young age.</p>\n\n<p>At the age of 23, I ventured into politics and ran for political office for the Member of County Assembly. It was quite a big risk taking a break from campus given that I was being supported financially to study as my parents could barely afford to support our education. My challenges and experiences while running for political office as a young woman inspired the founding of Badili Africa.</p>\n\n<p>Before founding Badili Africa, I worked for International Foundation for Electoral Systems (IFES \u2013 Kenya). I was the program officer, contributing to the co-creation of programs and advocacy campaigns aimed at cultivating informed choices and active participation of women and youth in electoral processes. I had also worked as a journalist at K24 which gave me a unique opportunity of working with marginalized and underserved communities.</p>\n\n<p>b). <strong>The work you do at Badili Africa has been appreciated globally, what does this mean to you? \n</strong></p>\n\n<p>As a community mobilizer, facilitator, mentor, speaker, and moderator, it has been an honour to be invited to and take part in global discussions across initiatives like; the Obama Africa Leaders Program in South Africa, the Bill and Melinda Gates Goalkeepers in New York, USA, African Union regional meetings, United Nations Population Fund Africa and Women at Dev among others.</p>\n\n<p>The exposure has enriched my perspective on African leadership and how our challenges are so interconnected and will need us to be intentional in building solidarity towards solving them. It has also expanded my leadership skills in governance, development and policymaking.</p>\n\n<figure><img src=\"https://www.nairobileo.co.ke/uploads/posts/IMG-20211020211606.jpeg\"></figure>\n\n<p>2. A<strong>s a journalist and Communication Specialist walk us through your career journey, some of the events that have shaped it and your proud moments?\n</strong></p>\n\n<p>My journalism journey enriched my understanding of issues I have grown to be passionate about and exposed me to how social justice efforts, legislation, and politics can affect citizens\u2019 wellbeing.</p>\n\n<p>One of my highlights was a story I focused on recognizing the important role the informal sector plays in our economy to encourage more young people to embrace and transform the sector as opposed to waiting for blue-collar jobs that are not easy to come by.</p>\n\n<p>The World Bank\u2019s Kenya economic update estimates 800,000 youth reach working age annually yet only 50,000 new formal modern wage jobs are created. The Informal sector represents a whopping 82.7% of employment according to research by the Institute of Economic Affairs.</p>\n\n<p>I interviewed business owners of big and small enterprises in the informal sector majority of whom had abandoned their blue-collar jobs to run their businesses in the informal sector. The public received the story well. I remember receiving some calls and messages from some young people requesting to be connected with some of the business owners in the informal markets who had opportunities and they were absorbed.</p>\n\n<p>3. <strong>You ran for political office as a 23-year-old. Please paint a picture for us about your experience, some challenges you faced and three key lessons you learnt?\n</strong></p>\n\n<p>Nothing prepares you enough for the world of politics not even the workshops I attended. Campaigning was quite costly for me coupled with balancing political life with university studies and domestic responsibilities, dealing with self-identity issues, security issues, and electoral violence.</p>\n\n<p>Then there\u2019s the reality of losing the elections, the trauma that accompanies it, the struggle to find work opportunities because people are hesitant to employ a \u201cpolitician\u201d or the challenge of raising resources to start or resurrect a business after spending everything in the campaigns.</p>\n\n<p>Electoral violence remains a key deterrent to women participating in political leadership spaces.

A Social & Criminal Justice Reforms and System Change Influencer with a background in banking and finance.", "articleBody": "In our segment of #KenyaWomenSeries, we feature, Teresa Njoroge. A Social & Criminal Justice Reforms and System Change Influencer with a background in banking and finance.\n\nAfter being wrongly arrested and convicted in connection with a major fraud case in Nairobi, she turned this misfortune into a course by starting a social enterprise - Clean Start Solutions Kenya. Through this initiative, she ardently advocates against social injustices in Kenya and Africa. Her focus is on how imprisonment disproportionately affects individuals and families living in poverty.\n\nToday she is an Inaugural Ford Foundation Global Fellow, a Vital Voices Lead Global Fellow, a TED Women 2017 Speaker, and the recipient of the African Female Leader 2018 Excellence Award by The Global Thinkers Forum, United Kingdom. Women and Girls Lead Global has also recognized her company's efforts as an outstanding advocate for marginalized groups.\n\nTeresa is a mother of two amazing upcoming changemakers; her daughter, Umaa, 10, whose name means Truth, and her son Uhuru 8, whose name means Freedom.\n\n1. Please tell us how your childhood shaped you for a career in banking while highlighting some of your major achievements and the events that have shaped them?\n\nAs young as nine years, I wanted to be a professional banker. I drew inspiration from my dad, a career banker and one of my most significant role models. I, therefore, put in a concerted effort in my studies and eventually achieved my dream career. Over the years, I grew up the ranks into management with various international banks in Nairobi, Kenya. I loved the tools, skills, language, and phenomenal networks that I gained within my banking career.\n\nThe intrinsic value of any work is what the process makes you. Working within the financial sector taught me how to achieve greatness in productivity, performance, and impact by insulating the designs of my life and fortifying my ideals while protecting my optimism. However, I detected that the low-income people were excluded from the products and services within the banking sector. At the back of my mind, I always had the question around the incredible disparity among people.\n\n2. As the Founder and Director of Clean Start Solution, tell us more about the organisation; what inspired you to start it, what's the vision and what does the organization aim to achieve?\n\nIn 2009, I was wrongfully arrested, maliciously prosecuted, falsely convicted, and served a one-year sentence in Langata Women's Maximum-Security Prison, the largest women correctional facility for women here in Kenya. I was later acquitted, vindicated, and cleared of any wrongdoing in February 2013.\n\nThis first-hand harsh and unjust experience with the criminal justice system is what inspired me to set up the social enterprise - Clean Start. I had one aim, to ensure that other women would have a more justified experience than what my daughter and I had, one with dignity, hope, and a pathway to rebuilding their lives.\n\nAt Clean Start, we equip and empower vulnerable children who accompany their mothers to prison to serve their sentences, girls, and women. Due to poverty-related issues, these women and girls end up in conflict with the law or imprisoned within Kenya's juvenile justice system or criminal justice system.\n\nWe seek to prepare the children of imprisoned mothers, the young girls, and the women for the forbidding journey of reintegration back into society after serving their jail term.\n\nOur vision is to Reimagine the Future & Reclaim Destinies. Reimagine the world, one that is inclusive, embracing equality and diversity, reimagine justice, reimagine our systems, reimagine how we treat the poor, the vulnerable, and the marginalized while reclaiming the destinies of those who are directly impacted and caught up in the mess.\n\nWe are a community that is essentially committed to social justice, changing the current narratives that dominate the criminal justice system especially towards women.\n\nWe aim to cut the high rates of reoffending, help reduce systematic legal and societal barriers and grow the nations restorative justice programs. We are at the forefront through our advocacy work to stop the stigmatization of formerly imprisoned individuals.\n\n3. You are passionate about justice and giving a second chance, especially to people who have been imprisoned, why is that so? What drives you?\n\nI believe in second chances but realizing that most of those we work with haven't had a first. They never had economic nor education opportunities, access to health care, affordable housing which all contribute towards the survival petty offences that land them in prison.\n\nFor most imprisoned individuals, a release date is inevitable. People refer to reintegrating back to society as a second chance. For us, the real second chance is when the collateral consequences and rife stigmatization of the formerly imprisoned are removed and society no longer shuns those affected. My vision is to have an inclusive and more just world, one where punishment should not be our impulse, support and care should, especially when someone is seeking help.\n\nYou will be surprised how complex this is. We lost a formerly imprisoned woman when she scotched herself and her son after serving a five-year prison sentence but could not complete a year on the outside post imprisonment due to the heavy stigmatization. We cannot afford to lose another one. We wonder, who decides which lives are more precious than others? What does it mean to be human? These are some of the questions that drive me and keep me going.\n\nFile image of Teresa Njoroge\n\n4. Having gone through injustice and now working with women and children impacted by the criminal justice system to restore their dignity, hope, and successful reintegration, what three things do you think can be done to change the criminal justice system in Kenya?\n\n\uf0fc Decriminalize poverty and declassify petty offences. Repeal of the Colonial-era Vagrancy Laws that overwhelmingly target the poor and most marginalized. These laws violate rights enshrined in the African Charter on Human and Peoples' Rights, including the rights to equality, dignity and freedom from cruel and inhuman treatment, among others.\n\n\uf0fc Proximity. We need to get closer to suffering and injustice, to those places where there's poverty, abuse and neglect and abandonment. Those closest to the problems are also closest to the solutions and often far from the resources. Lived experiences form a crucial background in policymaking, and we have to centre those who are directly impacted as experts close to the solutions. Nothing for them without them.\n\n\uf0fc We have to be willing to do the uncomfortable things. I've never seen justice prevail where people only did things that were convenient and comfortable. So get comfortable doing the uncomfortable things.\n\n5. If you were to choose the two most important values that shape the way you live and keep you grounded, what would they be and why?\n\nI. Love. Doing what you love is the cornerstone of having abundance in your life. It's the greatest motivation.\n\nII. Integrity. You are defined by what you say and do. You must move with integrity.\n\n6. Given an opportunity to reimagine the world, is there is anything you would change? If yes, what will it be and why?\n\nLeadership! We need more servant leaders on our planet, human beings who are givers, not takers. Who value contribution above self-glorification because to lead is to serve, and to help is to prosper.\n\nI would urge everyone to find a mighty mission, one that will consume you, taking your mind and heart off of the mess that's all around us. Losing yourself in the service of others is a beautiful formula for becoming happier as we navigate the issues that impact our society.\n\n7.

Honour yourself and courageously pursue your passion with curiosity and compassion.\n\n\u2022 Forging networks. Networks should be growth spaces that are a give and take.\n\n\u2022 Taking risks.

A\u00a0Social &amp; Criminal Justice Reforms and System Change Influencer with a background in banking and finance.</p>\n\n<p>After being wrongly arrested and convicted in connection with a major fraud case in Nairobi, she turned this misfortune into a course by starting a social enterprise - Clean Start Solutions Kenya. Through this initiative, she ardently advocates against social injustices in Kenya and Africa. Her focus is on how imprisonment disproportionately affects individuals and families living in poverty.</p>\n\n<p>Today she is an Inaugural Ford Foundation Global Fellow, a Vital Voices Lead Global Fellow, a TED Women 2017 Speaker, and the recipient of the African Female Leader 2018 Excellence Award by The Global Thinkers Forum, United Kingdom. Women and Girls Lead Global has also recognized her company's efforts as an outstanding advocate for marginalized groups.</p>\n\n<p>Teresa is a mother of two amazing upcoming changemakers; her daughter, Umaa, 10, whose name means Truth, and her son Uhuru 8, whose name means Freedom.</p>\n\n<p>1. <strong>Please tell us how your childhood shaped you for a career in banking while highlighting some of your major achievements and the events that have shaped them?\n</strong></p>\n\n<p>As young as nine years, I wanted to be a professional banker. I drew inspiration from my dad, a career banker and one of my most significant role models. I, therefore, put in a concerted effort in my studies and eventually achieved my dream career. Over the years, I grew up the ranks into management with various international banks in Nairobi, Kenya. I loved the tools, skills, language, and phenomenal networks that I gained within my banking career.</p>\n\n<p>The intrinsic value of any work is what the process makes you. Working within the financial sector taught me how to achieve greatness in productivity, performance, and impact by insulating the designs of my life and fortifying my ideals while protecting my optimism. However, I detected that the low-income people were excluded from the products and services within the banking sector. At the back of my mind, I always had the question around the incredible disparity among people.</p>\n\n<p>2. <strong>As the Founder and Director of Clean Start Solution, tell us more about the organisation; what inspired you to start it, what's the vision and what does the organization aim to achieve?\n</strong></p>\n\n<p>In 2009, I was wrongfully arrested, maliciously prosecuted, falsely convicted, and served a one-year sentence in Langata Women's Maximum-Security Prison, the largest women correctional facility for women here in Kenya. I was later acquitted, vindicated, and cleared of any wrongdoing in February 2013.</p>\n\n<p>This first-hand harsh and unjust experience with the criminal justice system is what inspired me to set up the social enterprise - Clean Start. I had one aim, to ensure that other women would have a more justified experience than what my daughter and I had, one with dignity, hope, and a pathway to rebuilding their lives.</p>\n\n<p>At Clean Start, we equip and empower vulnerable children who accompany their mothers to prison to serve their sentences, girls, and women. Due to poverty-related issues, these women and girls end up in conflict with the law or imprisoned within Kenya's juvenile justice system or criminal justice system.</p>\n\n<p>We seek to prepare the children of imprisoned mothers, the young girls, and the women for the forbidding journey of reintegration back into society after serving their jail term.</p>\n\n<p>Our vision is to Reimagine the Future &amp; Reclaim Destinies. Reimagine the world, one that is inclusive, embracing equality and diversity, reimagine justice, reimagine our systems, reimagine how we treat the poor, the vulnerable, and the marginalized while reclaiming the destinies of those who are directly impacted and caught up in the mess.</p>\n\n<figure><p><img src=\"https://www.nairobileo.co.ke/uploads/posts/IMG-20210929180355.jpeg\"><br></p><figcaption><p><em>File image of Teresa Njoroge</em></p></figcaption></figure>\n\n<p>We are a community that is essentially committed to social justice, changing the current narratives that dominate the criminal justice system especially towards women.</p>\n\n<p>We aim to cut the high rates of reoffending, help reduce systematic legal and societal barriers and grow the nations restorative justice programs. We are at the forefront through our advocacy work to stop the stigmatization of formerly imprisoned individuals.</p>\n\n<p>3. <strong>You are passionate about justice and giving a second chance, especially to people who have been imprisoned, why is that so? What drives you?\n</strong></p>\n\n<p>I believe in second chances but realizing that most of those we work with haven't had a first. They never had economic nor education opportunities, access to health care, affordable housing which all contribute towards the survival petty offences that land them in prison.</p>\n\n<p>For most imprisoned individuals, a release date is inevitable. People refer to reintegrating back to society as a second chance. For us, the real second chance is when the collateral consequences and rife stigmatization of the formerly imprisoned are removed and society no longer shuns those affected. My vision is to have an inclusive and more just world, one where punishment should not be our impulse, support and care should, especially when someone is seeking help.</p>\n\n<p>You will be surprised how complex this is. We lost a formerly imprisoned woman when she scotched herself and her son after serving a five-year prison sentence but could not complete a year on the outside post imprisonment due to the heavy stigmatization. We cannot afford to lose another one. We wonder, who decides which lives are more precious than others? What does it mean to be human? These are some of the questions that drive me and keep me going.</p>\n\n<p><img src=\"https://www.nairobileo.co.ke/uploads/posts/IMG-20210929180540.jpeg\"><br></p>\n\n<p><em>File image of Teresa Njoroge</em></p>\n\n<p>4. <strong>Having gone through injustice and now working with women and children impacted by the criminal justice system to restore their dignity, hope, and successful reintegration, what three things do you think can be done to change the criminal justice system in Kenya?\n</strong></p>\n\n<p>\uf0fc\tDecriminalize poverty and declassify petty offences.

The Executive Director of Mzalendo Trust. ", "articleBody": "In our segment of #KenyaWomenSeries, we feature, Caroline Gaita. The Executive Director of Mzalendo Trust, Kenya\u2019s premier (and only) parliamentary monitoring organization.\n\nShe describes herself as a woman of many definitions: resilient; grounded; a lover of Kenya and all things football. Professionally though, she is an experienced communication and governance specialist trying to live out her purpose in life, undividedly.\n\n1. Talk to us about your career journey highlighting the significant achievements and the events around them? What are some of your proudest moments?\n\nMy journey has been quite interesting. Growing up, I wanted to be a lawyer because that is what my parent envisioned for my sister and me. From an early age, I loved history and politics.\n\nI would read the papers, follow the political coverage with my dad as well as read his magazines such as the Weekly Review and Finance, etc. After college, I worked in a legal firm after which I was fortunate to join a Public Relations firm founded by the woman I honor as my mentor (Muthoni Muthiga - may she rest in peace). It was a boutique PR firm, and my responsibilities tanged from administration duties to managing events.\n\nCaroline Gaita\n\nThe support she accorded, catalyzed my interest in Public Relations as a career. Public relations is a field that I have effectively combined with my Political Science and development background. She was also instrumental in my joining the Public Relations Society of Kenya \u2013 albeit I have not been as active as I ought to.\n\nOver the years, my career has journeyed through the insurance, tourism, and now governance sector, where I found my niche. But perhaps, the most profound impact on my career path was triggered by the post-election violence of 2007/2008.\n\nUntil then, I had been a carefree Kenyan, never thought much about ethnicity, and consumed political news for what it was, politics. The events, however, led me to a deeper engagement in the process, especially the Constitution of Kenya 2010. When an opportunity to join the Commission for the Implementation of the Constitution (CIC) arose in 2012, I took it up and haven\u2019t looked back as an advocate and a key champion of the Constitution.\n\nAfter CIC, I joined the Society for International Development, and later Transparency International -Kenya, coordinating the Shule Yangu Campaign.\n\nThis is the journey and process that led to my current position as the Executive Director of Mzalendo Trust, Kenya\u2019s premier (and only) parliamentary monitoring organization.\n\nThere have been many proud moments along the way \u2013 when in CIC, every time a bill that we had worked on was enacted, it was our pride. Winning the PRSK and SABRE Best Public Affairs Campaign in Kenya and Africa respectively, for the RedCard Campaign for Integrity run by the National Integrity Alliance in 2017/2018 and building Mzalendo Trust to the institution it has become \u2013 in terms of funding, staffing, partnerships among others.\n\n2. a) As the Executive Director of Mzalendo Watch, paint a picture for us about what it means to be a woman in Senior Management.\n\nI have risen to the helm of Mzalendo Trust at a time when women are breaking glass ceilings in all fields. From Kamala Harris in America and Tanzania\u2019s President Samia Suluhu in politics, to Simon Bile in sports. I believe, the future is gearing towards becoming female. I know it has been a tough process, and the fact that the world\u2019s oldest democracy has only broken the ceiling to see Kamala Harris serve as Vice President is a testament.\n\nThe weight on my shoulders and that of others like me is, therefore, not lost. It means that I have an opportunity to do things differently and shape the next generation of women leaders.\n\nTo be a guiding example for my team particularly young women, mentor them and pave the way for them. More importantly, it means that there\u2019s a lot of inward-looking and reflection to ensure that I do not lose sight of the vision and I\u2019m alive to the institutional internal and external needs.\n\nb) Based on your experience, what lessons have you learnt about dealing with unconscious bias, breaking barriers, influencing, and occupying decision-making positions?\n\nCaroline Gaita\n\nOur work, informed by our current strategic direction focused in the youth and women, in terms of political representation and participation.\n\nWe recognize that the Parliament we aspire to, one that is open, inclusive and accountable to the country can only be realized if the political processes are accommodating and diverse.\n\nTherefore, working within this space has in some ways opened and in others reinforced barriers and biases that continue to influence decision making processes. From culture to money to biased media coverage of women, the biases are many. Technology and social media have also opened new battle fields for women \u2013 online bullying and cyber-attacks continue to lock many women from platforms that would help amplify their work. Additionally, women have to continually hold themselves to a higher standard, in terms of performance for them to be recognized. We are the ones to change the narrative, by telling and shaping our stories to being the ones bringing the tables. My dream is to see more and equal spaces for women in the C-Suite.\n\n3. Kenya is gearing up for general elections in 2022. From your position, what would you like to see around democracy and governance issues?\n\nThere is an entire pot of issues that the country needs to address ahead of elections. From the current enhanced voter registration exercise, you can tell the level of apathy is very high \u2013 with a 17% registration rate against the target.\n\nThe Covid-19 pandemic has also exposed citizens to many challenges socially, economically, and even politically. There are many things to address. We need to ensure the inclusion of youth, women, and persons with disability to enhance not just their registration but their participation as aspirants. We have been advocating for the regulation of campaign financing, given that the cost of politics is a barrier to the participation of vulnerable groups.\n\nIn the absence of the operationalization of the legal framework, there is a need for citizens to own the process and de-campaign big money. Centering integrity as a key during campaigns is critical as per the Constitutional provisions on leadership and integrity in chapter six, as well as ethos as enumerated in the national values.\n\nSadly, we have weakened this over time, and the caliber of leaders \u2013 going by the number are those currently facing court cases \u2013 or have been impeached \u2013 speaks to this. Finally, there are the issues of transparency in the electoral process itself to ensure credible, verifiable, and peaceful elections.\n\nWhether it\u2019s the IEBC who will be conducting the elections, Parliament passing the necessary legislation, political parties providing a level playing field during the party primaries to the independence of institutions such as the Judiciary and Kenya Police Service to aspirants in terms of their conducts during their campaigns, we all need to play our role. Citizens too must ensure the choice of leaders is credible. The absence of transparency and integrity will breed chaos and lead to the violation of both democratic and human rights.\n\n4. We seem to be in a country that is immersed in corruption. We must strive to break the chain of corruption. Will you kindly tell us, how do the following aspects help in dealing with corruption in Kenya?\n\na). Integrity\n\nWithin the governance sector, Chapter 6 of the Constitution on Leadership and Integrity was not a lofty aspiration for Kenyans. There is a reason that the framers of the Constitution found it necessary to anchor it in law, perhaps because of the impact on development and socio-economic growth.\n\nIntegrity is what defines our conduct privately and publicly. Institutions and/or persons guided by a set of values and who stand for something are more likely to act when things don\u2019t go right. They are courageous because they have nothing to lose. If we get it right on this national value, then we shall be able to build a good foundation for current and future generations.\n\nb). Transparency\n\nTransparency and openness build trust between institutions and the people. It eliminates opaqueness in systems and processes \u2013 from appointments to procurement, to sharing information.\n\nIt ought to be made accessible. In public procurement systems, for instance, transparency can help a great deal in preventing biased tendering systems, give a fair chance to interested entrepreneurs to do business with Government institutions and agencies and therefore, build trust.\n\nc). Accountability\n\nAs a country, we ought to strengthen our accountability systems for all implicated in acts of corruption to avoid the scenarios of getting a slap on the wrist. From long court processes to acts of impunity and disregard for the rule of law, we have not reached intolerant levels of corruption as a nation.\n\nIf you were to choose the two most important values that shape the way you live by and keep you grounded, what would they be and why?\n\nResilience and humility. Why resilience? Life beats you. There are many setbacks. And if covid-19 has taught us one thing, it\u2019s been that life can come at you unexpectedly. Its resilient, adaptive organizations and people have withstood the challenges. At a personal level, life is not linear, and through the many curves, you have to adapt \u2013 whether socially, financially or professionally. For me resilience and fortitude come from a strong point of faith. I endeavor to lead an undivided life, meaning that the values that guide me in the marketplace also apply to my life outside work.\n\nHumility \u2013 As a woman in leadership, this may be considered an oxymoron because we have been challenged to blow our horn. I believe it\u2019s possible to do so without losing your sense of grounding. For me, this humility is in the opportunity to keep learning even when I think I know best, in treating everyone with respect and courtesy regardless of rank, listening and remaining grounded in family and friendships that have been an anchor for my life. I challenge myself to always remember who I am, outside my title and to remain authentic to myself, my beliefs and the things I hold dear.\n\n5. Tell us what role has each of the following aspects played in your career life, giving brief real-life experiences?\n\n\u2022 Pursuing your passion\n\nWhen you love what you do, results are visible. I recognize that it\u2019s not always easy to find work that matches your passion, and many a time, we are stuck in spaces because we have bills to pay. And so, in most cases, we only have this privilege later in our careers, because we are more settled and have clarity then. Nevertheless, when you find your passion and can live it every day, you thrive. And for me, that\u2019s really been my life \u2013 pursuit of my passion. I am fortunate that my current role gives me the best of both worlds \u2013 leveraging on communication to enhance good governance. It drives me, pushes me to knock doors I ordinarily wouldn\u2019t.\n\n\u2022 Forging networks\n\nI like to think of my life as incremental value of many pieces, in this case, people, who have mentored, molded, challenged, opened and in some cases, closed doors. One of the books I read early on in my career is \u201cNetworking for Success\u201d. You build businesses, mobilize resources, recruit people and get opportunities through networks.\n\nGranted, it\u2019s not an easy process, because not all of us are able to walk into rooms and get those results with the accompanying charm and charisma. But it\u2019s something that, we throughout life, must invest in across various specters of our lives. Even our own burials are determined by the networks we build while we lived. So, invest in networks, be credible, be reciprocal and resourceful. Fortunately, we also live at a time when technology has made this process much easier, but we should still invest in building relationships.\n\n\u2022 Taking risks\n\nA quote attributed to Dalai Lama says \u201ctake into account great love and great achievements involve great risk.\u201d To me, everyday life is a risk. You wake up and make choices that have consequences whichever way you look at it. And so, I have taken risk in life, in love, in investments, and in my career, where I have gained big but also lost bigger. Jobs that threatened my career or were not a fit, investments that went under. But do I stop taking risks? No. I do it daily. I want to lead a life well lived and can only do so but putting myself out there and taking the risks.\n\n\u2022 Mentorship\n\nMy life story is littered, as I indicated earlier, with people that have mentored me and held my hand. I believe in paying it forward and opening doors for others and mentoring is one way to do this.\n\n6. As we head towards the electioneering period, lets be ready to take responsibility for our actions. We have a role in building the Kenya we want.\n\nOur governance structure is beautiful. Public participation, access to information rights \u2013 the Constitution generally is a platform from which we as citizens, can inform the direction of our country. We can vote, participation in the running of our country from ward level to the national, engage in legislative processes, demand accountability from our leadership and put in office leaders of good caliber and speak up when things go wrong. Let\u2019s be the custodians of this beautiful nation.\n\n7. Any parting shot?\n\nAs women, we live in unprecedented times. Our generation has opportunities that our mothers and grandmothers did not have. The only limits are within. So, we need to show up and do so courageously. We need to create possibilities for ourselves and our children. We have to keep learning, re-skilling, and up-skilling. Brene Brown says \u201cyou either walk inside your story and own it or stand outside your story and hustle for your worthiness.\u201d Let\u2019s know our worth, tell our stories and own it.", "articleBodyHtml": "<article>\n\n<p>In our segment of #KenyaWomenSeries, we feature, Caroline Gaita.

When an opportunity to join the Commission for the Implementation of the Constitution (CIC) arose in 2012, I took it up and haven\u2019t looked back as an advocate and a key champion of the Constitution.</p>\n\n<p>After CIC, I joined the Society for International Development, and later Transparency International -Kenya, coordinating the Shule Yangu Campaign.</p>\n\n<p>This is the journey and process that led to my current position as the Executive Director of Mzalendo Trust, Kenya\u2019s premier (and only) parliamentary monitoring organization.</p>\n\n<p>There have been many proud moments along the way \u2013 when in CIC, every time a bill that we had worked on was enacted, it was our pride.  Winning the PRSK and SABRE Best Public Affairs Campaign in Kenya and Africa respectively, for the RedCard Campaign for Integrity run by the National Integrity Alliance in 2017/2018 and building Mzalendo Trust to the institution it has become \u2013 in terms of funding, staffing, partnerships among others.</p>\n\n<p>2.<strong>\ta) As the Executive Director of Mzalendo Watch, paint a picture for us about what it means to be a woman in Senior Management. \n</strong></p>\n\n<p>I have risen to the helm of Mzalendo Trust at a time when women are breaking glass ceilings in all fields. From Kamala Harris in America and Tanzania\u2019s President Samia Suluhu in politics, to Simon Bile in sports. I believe, the future is gearing towards becoming female. I know it has been a tough process, and the fact that the world\u2019s oldest democracy has only broken the ceiling to see Kamala Harris serve as Vice President is a testament.</p>\n\n<p>The weight on my shoulders and that of others like me is, therefore, not lost.  It means that I have an opportunity to do things differently and shape the next generation of women leaders.</p>\n\n<p>To be a guiding example for my team particularly young women, mentor them and pave the way for them. More importantly, it means that there\u2019s a lot of inward-looking and reflection to ensure that I do not lose sight of the vision and I\u2019m alive to the institutional internal and external needs.</p>\n\n<p>b)<strong>\tBased on your experience, what lessons have you learnt about dealing with unconscious bias, breaking barriers, influencing, and occupying decision-making positions?</strong></p>\n\n<p><img src=\"https://www.nairobileo.co.ke/uploads/posts/IMG-20211027220252.jpeg\"><em>Caroline Gaita</em></p>\n\n<p>Our work, informed by our current strategic direction focused in the youth and women, in terms of political representation and participation.</p>\n\n<p>We recognize that the Parliament we aspire to, one that is open, inclusive and accountable to the country can only be realized if the political processes are accommodating and diverse.</p>\n\n<p>Therefore, working within this space has in some ways opened and in others reinforced barriers and biases that continue to influence decision making processes.  From culture to money to biased media coverage of women, the biases are many.  Technology and social media have also opened new battle fields for women \u2013 online bullying and cyber-attacks continue to lock many women from platforms that would help amplify their work. Additionally, women have to continually hold themselves to a higher standard, in terms of performance for them to be recognized. We are the ones to change the narrative, by telling and shaping our stories to being the ones bringing the tables. My dream is to see more and equal spaces for women in the C-Suite.</p>\n\n<p>3.<strong>\tKenya is gearing up for general elections in 2022. From your position, what would you like to see around democracy and governance issues?\n</strong></p>\n\n<p>There is an entire pot of issues that the country needs to address ahead of elections.  From the current enhanced voter registration exercise, you can tell the level of apathy is very high \u2013 with a 17% registration rate against the target.</p>\n\n<p>The Covid-19 pandemic has also exposed citizens to many challenges socially, economically, and even politically.  There are many things to address.  We need to ensure the inclusion of youth, women, and persons with disability to enhance not just their registration but their participation as aspirants.  We have been advocating for the regulation of campaign financing, given that the cost of politics is a barrier to the participation of vulnerable groups.</p>\n\n<p>In the absence of the operationalization of the legal framework, there is a need for citizens to own the process and de-campaign big money. Centering integrity as a key during campaigns is critical as per the Constitutional provisions on leadership and integrity in chapter six, as well as ethos as enumerated in the national values.</p>\n\n<p>Sadly, we have weakened this over time, and the caliber of leaders \u2013 going by the number are those currently facing court cases \u2013 or have been impeached \u2013 speaks to this. Finally, there are the issues of transparency in the electoral process itself to ensure credible, verifiable, and peaceful elections.</p>\n\n<p>Whether it\u2019s the IEBC who will be conducting the elections, Parliament passing the necessary legislation, political parties providing a level playing field during the party primaries to the independence of institutions such as the Judiciary and Kenya Police Service to aspirants in terms of their conducts during their campaigns, we all need to play our role.  Citizens too must ensure the choice of leaders is credible. The absence of transparency and integrity will breed chaos and lead to the violation of both democratic and human rights.</p>\n\n<p>4.\t<strong>We seem to be in a country that is immersed in corruption. We must strive to break the chain of corruption. Will you kindly tell us, how do the following aspects help in dealing with corruption in Kenya?\n</strong></p>\n\n<p>a). <strong>Integrity\n</strong></p>\n\n<p>Within the governance sector, Chapter 6 of the Constitution on Leadership and Integrity was not a lofty aspiration for Kenyans.  There is a reason that the framers of the Constitution found it necessary to anchor it in law, perhaps because of the impact on development and socio-economic growth.</p>\n\n<p>Integrity is what defines our conduct privately and publicly.  Institutions and/or persons guided by a set of values and who stand for something are more likely to act when things don\u2019t go right.  They are courageous because they have nothing to lose.  If we get it right on this national value, then we shall be able to build a good foundation for current and future generations.</p>\n\n<p>b)<strong>. Transparency\n</strong></p>\n\n<p>Transparency and openness build trust between institutions and the people. It eliminates opaqueness in systems and processes \u2013 from appointments to procurement, to sharing information.</p>\n\n<p>It ought to be made accessible. In public procurement systems, for instance, transparency can help a great deal in preventing biased tendering systems, give a fair chance to interested entrepreneurs to do business with Government institutions and agencies and therefore, build trust.</p>\n\n<p>c). <strong>Accountability \n</strong></p>\n\n<p>As a country, we ought to strengthen our accountability systems for all implicated in acts of corruption to avoid the scenarios of getting a slap on the wrist.  From long court processes to acts of impunity and disregard for the rule of law, we have not reached intolerant levels of corruption as a nation.</p>\n\n<p>If you were to choose the two most important values that shape the way you live by and keep you grounded, what would they be and why?</p>\n\n<p><strong>Resilience and humility. </strong>Why resilience? Life beats you.  There are many setbacks.  And if covid-19 has taught us one thing, it\u2019s been that life can come at you unexpectedly.  Its resilient, adaptive organizations and people have withstood the challenges. At a personal level, life is not linear, and through the many curves, you have to adapt \u2013 whether socially, financially or professionally. For me resilience and fortitude come from a strong point of faith.  I endeavor to lead an undivided life, meaning that the values that guide me in the marketplace also apply to my life outside work.</p>\n\n<p>Humility \u2013 As a woman in leadership, this may be considered an oxymoron because we have been challenged to blow our horn. I believe it\u2019s possible to do so without losing your sense of grounding.  For me, this humility is in the opportunity to keep learning even when I think I know best, in treating everyone with respect and courtesy regardless of rank, listening and remaining grounded in family and friendships that have been an anchor for my life.  I challenge myself to always remember who I am, outside my title and to remain authentic to myself, my beliefs and the things I hold dear.</p>\n\n<figure><p><img src=\"https://www.nairobileo.co.ke/uploads/posts/IMG-20211027220308.jpeg\"><br></p><figcaption><p><em>Caroline Gaita</em></p></figcaption></figure>\n\n<p>5.\t<strong>Tell us what role has each of the following aspects played in your career life, giving brief real-life experiences?\n</strong></p>\n\n<p>\u2022\tPursuing your passion</p>\n\n<p>When you love what you do, results are visible.  I recognize that it\u2019s not always easy to find work that matches your passion, and many a time, we are stuck in spaces because we have bills to pay.  And so, in most cases, we only have this privilege later in our careers, because we are more settled and have clarity then.  Nevertheless, when you find your passion and can live it every day, you thrive.  And for me, that\u2019s really been my life \u2013 pursuit of my passion.  I am fortunate that my current role gives me the best of both worlds \u2013 leveraging on communication to enhance good governance.  It drives me, pushes me to knock doors I ordinarily wouldn\u2019t.</p>\n\n<p>\u2022\tForging networks</p>\n\n<p>I like to think of my life as incremental value of many pieces, in this case, people, who have mentored, molded, challenged, opened and in some cases, closed doors.  One of the books I read early on in my career is \u201cNetworking for Success\u201d.  You build businesses, mobilize resources, recruit people and get opportunities through networks.</p>\n\n<p>Granted, it\u2019s not an easy process, because not all of us are able to walk into rooms and get those results with the accompanying charm and charisma.  But it\u2019s something that, we throughout life, must invest in across various specters of our lives. Even our own burials are determined by the networks we build while we lived. So, invest in networks, be credible, be reciprocal and resourceful.  Fortunately, we also live at a time when technology has made this process much easier, but we should still invest in building relationships.</p>\n\n<p>\u2022\tTaking risks</p>\n\n<p>A quote attributed to Dalai Lama says \u201ctake into account great love and great achievements involve great risk.\u201d  To me, everyday life is a risk.  You wake up and make choices that have consequences whichever way you look at it.  And so, I have taken risk in life, in love, in investments, and in my career, where I have gained big but also lost bigger.  Jobs that threatened my career or were not a fit, investments that went under.  But do I stop taking risks? No.  I do it daily.  I want to lead a life well lived and can only do so but putting myself out there and taking the risks.</p>\n\n<p>\u2022\tMentorship</p>\n\n<p>My life story is littered, as I indicated earlier, with people that have mentored me and held my hand. I believe in paying it forward and opening doors for others and mentoring is one way to do this.</p>\n\n<p>6.\t<strong>As we head towards the electioneering period, lets be ready to take responsibility for our actions. We have a role in building the Kenya we want.\n</strong></p>\n\n<p>Our governance structure is beautiful.  Public participation, access to information rights \u2013 the Constitution generally is a platform from which we as citizens, can inform the direction of our country. We can vote, participation in the running of our country from ward level to the national, engage in legislative processes, demand accountability from our leadership and put in office leaders of good caliber and speak up when things go wrong.  Let\u2019s be the custodians of this beautiful nation.</p>\n\n<p>7.\tAny parting shot?</p>\n\n<p>As women, we live in unprecedented times.  Our generation has opportunities that our mothers and grandmothers did not have.  The only limits are within.  So, we need to show up and do so courageously.  We need to create possibilities for ourselves and our children. We have to keep learning, re-skilling, and up-skilling.\u00a0Brene Brown says \u201cyou either walk inside your story and own it or stand outside your story and hustle for your worthiness.\u201d Let\u2019s know our worth, tell our stories and own it.</p>\n\n</article>", "canonicalUrl": "https://www.nairobileo.co.ke/opinions/4836/caroline-gaita-inspirational-woman-leading-mzalendo-trust-kenyas-only-parliamentary-monitoring-organization"},{"url": "https://www.nairobileo.co.ke/opinions/5108/nancy-marangu-one-of-the-ladies-behind-inspiring-moving-stories-on-kenya-women-series", "probability": 0.99400675, "headline": "Nancy Marangu: One of the Ladies Behind Inspiring & Moving Stories on Kenya Women Series", "datePublished": "2021-11-24T09:34:09.534513", "datePublishedRaw": "3 weeks ago", "author": "NairobiLeo Writer", "authorsList": ["NairobiLeo Writer"], "inLanguage": "en", "breadcrumbs": [{"name": "Home", "link": "https://www.nairobileo.co.ke/"}, {"name": "Opinions", "link": "https://www.nairobileo.co.ke/opinions"}, {"name": "Nancy Marangu: One of the Ladies Behind Inspiring & Moving Stories on Kenya Women Series"}], "mainImage": "https://www.nairobileo.co.ke/uploads/posts/IMG-20211118074320.jpg", "images": ["https://www.nairobileo.co.ke/uploads/posts/IMG-20211118074320.jpg", "https://www.nairobileo.co.ke/uploads/posts/IMG-20211118074655.jpg", "https://www.nairobileo.co.ke/uploads/posts/IMG-20211118074617.jpg", "https://www.nairobileo.co.ke/uploads/posts/IMG-20211118074740.jpg"], "description": "On our segment of #KenyaWomenSeries, we feature, Nancy Marangu, an expert in matters policy and entrepreneurship.", "articleBody": "On our segment of #KenyaWomenSeries, we feature, Nancy Marangu, an expert in matters policy and entrepreneurship.\n\nShe is a strategic advisor, trainer, communicator, and writer. \u2018My purpose and passion is to translate policy into bankable projects to enhance transformative change. I strive to translate policies and reports that I read into either published articles or project proposals.\u2019 she says. She describes herself as a creative and curious explorer.\n\n1. Briefly introduce yourself, who is Nancy Marangu?\n\nI am a creative and curious explorer, passionate about breaking down policy documents into projects. I once attended a COMESA conference attended by heads of states and really gained valuable insight. On my way back, I penned down an opinion article: COMESA states should plan for an integrated regional film ecosystem which was published in the Standard Newspaper. This was the genesis of my writing journey. https://www.standardmedia.co.ke/opinion/article/2001337288/comesa-states-should-plan-for-an-integrated-regional-film-ecosystem\n\nI am a strategic advisor. This is a role that has been imposed by friends who have severally called on me to guide on strategic direction for their organizations and businesses. Thanks to the United Nations Institute for Training and Research (UNITAR) and the World Bank learning portal that provide multi-sectorial courses, my knowledge base has been enriched and I have equipped myself with requisite aptitudes.\n\nI love to read Op-eds. This has been very instrumental in managing my mental health and wellness. I write for leisure, on climate change, technology, inclusion and film.\n\nI am also a lecturer, I have had a brief stint as an adjunct lecturer at Nazarene University.\n\n2. You have taken up managerial roles in your career? Talk to us about being a successful manager.\n\nIt has taken teamwork, being adaptable, and versatility to learn. These experiences among many others, always take me back to where I began my career journey, the Kenya Police Service where I was taught by my supervisor to embrace the can-do attitude.\n\n\u201cThe toughest course in life is to conquer self. Most often, our personal beliefs, assumptions, and stereotypes chain us to our preconceived worlds that impede progression. Unplug from these chains, allow yourself to embrace holistic attitudes, adjust your worldview, and reset your focus. Once you do so, you will manage to conquer yourself and your spheres of influence while building impactful worlds within our jurisdictions.\u201d\n\nI believe, there is pride in impact and transformative change. I am a transformative leader who believes in the power of empowerment and enlightenment. In my opinion, it does not matter who gets the recognition, what matters to me it\u2019s the results; it is done well.\n\nI don\u2019t know it all; I thrive in learning. I am not scared of asking questions. This has enabled me to build more relationships and learn effortlessly.\n\nInvest in personal operational systems- people, passion, purpose and planet. Be deliberate to imprint a signature of authenticity as a professional. Be empathetic; help people indiscriminately.\n\n3. Paint a picture for us about your volunteer journey including your experience as a volunteer for #KenyaWomenSeries\n\nI am a Board Member at Ukarimu Ministry Trust \u2013 which empowers all and sundry with life skills. I have served on the board since 2011. We have graduated over 200 students. I am delighted to have assumed different roles from being the treasurer to an assistant treasurer and now the representative of the alumni.\n\n#KenyaWomenSeries a weekly initiative that profiles powerhouse Kenyan women. I serve as an editor. Asked of my vision for KWS, I envisage a network of international women who will create a global mentorship platform for younger women, to instill them with professional acumen as they transit from learning institutions to the competitive job market.\n\n4. Any lessons from the women you\u2019ve profiled so far?\n\nOut of the 48 phenomenal women we have profiled, I have learnt there is no rulebook to success. Design your own rules. Everyone's journey is different and unique, however, the only constant is your purpose, vision and goal.\n\n\uf0fc The outstanding principal that everyone spoke about is people- they were mentored and are mentors; they leverage on team synergy.\n\n\uf0fc The power of social capital- It works only when an individual allows it to work. Importantly, every life experience does not have to be monetary. Plug in where your heart leads you.\n\n\uf0fc Teamwork is our drive. We achieve more when we embrace diversity, working like a chain and agreeing on who does what and when. Our MoU indicates that our readers/audience are waiting; we must deliver yet another profile. Each week, we look forward to reading new profiles while thanking God for renewed strength.\n\nThe intrinsic reward is the satisfaction that I get from reading people\u2019s journey into who they are today.\n\n5. Talk to us about your experience with the 48 profiles you\u2019ve edited so far. Which profile stunned you the most?\n\nAs an inclusion advocate, two profiles that shocked me include that of Crystal Asige and Judy Kahumba.\n\na). Crystal has shuttered the glass ceiling to live her passion in music. She has created awareness around the intersectionalities of being a young, black-African, female entrepreneur and leader with an invisible disability. She is not deterred in any way to create an inclusive world for persons with disabilities through music.\n\nDespite admitting that the challenges of exclusion are real, she has journeyed through the music industry to show the world that anything is attainable for anyone who is passionate and resilient. She is a testament that everyone requires an equal chance in life.\n\nb). Judy Kihumba is making information accessible to people who are deaf through the provision of sign language interpretation services. In my perspective, sometimes we get lost in our own cocoons and forget that there are those amongst us who cannot access what ordinarily everyone thinks is a right.\n\nTherefore, it\u2019s only kind to be deliberate to translate information into other readable formats to promote equal and inclusive information access. I realized that product and service providers also have opportunities to rethink their business models and make them more inclusive.\n\n6. You are among the Young African Leaders STG African cohort and the African Civic Engagement Academy (ACEA)? Kindly tell us more about it?\n\nThese are exciting opportunities to learn more about regional policies. Fellows of the Africa Programme are imparted with knowledge on strategic policy areas relevant to transnational governance.\n\nThe focus areas of the programme are crucial to delivering sustainable and locally owned development in African countries and contributing to effective implementation of the Africa-EU partnerships, the African Union\u2019s Agenda 2063, the African Continental Free Trade Area (AfCFTA), and the Global Compact for Migration.\n\nWhat is more, I am honored to be part of the 2021 cohort for the ACEA being facilitated by the University of Georgia, United States of America.\n\nAll of us have many chances in life, but we must live like an all-weathered tree, pruning unproductive habits and vices that impede progression. We must strive to keep sprouting like branches by upholding our values and virtues.\n\nFile image of Nancy Marangu.\n\n7. What do you do to recharge and remain true to yourself?\n\nAs a transformational advocate, my friends and I have our corporate social impact initiatives. As climate and inclusion advocates, we identify learning institutions for students with disabilities and support them. Furthermore, we provide technical support for women-led self-help groups to be socially and economically independent. Our goal is to ensure that persons with disabilities are empowered and provided with basic amenities that will go along well in eradicating rural poverty. I love nature and I enjoy traveling and hiking.\n\nThroughout my life, I have I learnt that \u201cLife is the only exam without a standardized marking scheme; giving everyone the free will to develop personal policies and strategic plans (marking schemes). Review them constantly to ascertain if you are still on course. Some terrains are steep giving one the reason to want to seat and give up! But resilience dictates one must keep going. Make every moment counts. Turn every fear into treasures of lessons that catapult and stretch you to stay on course at all times.\n\n8. If you were to choose the two most important values that you live by and keep you grounded, what would they be and why?\n\n\uf0a7 Patience: God created everyone uniquely and working with a diverse audience presents me opportunities to appreciate individual strengths, attitudes and accommodate weaknesses. Learning to be patient through life is a course on its own. The Serenity Prayer is my guiding principle here.\n\n\uf0a7 Humility: I am a product of God\u2019s divine provision and grace. I am mentored, have networked, and socialized with great men and women who have opened doors for me into spaces that ordinarily I would not reach. One constant word I have heard from all of them is humility. It is priceless to respect and treat everyone with equity.\n\n9. Any parting shot?\n\nI envision a budding film industry with not only a harmonized regional ecosystem but also an industry that advocates for climate justice. Without a doubt, the creative arts industry can contribute to the attainment of Kenya\u2019s Zero Net targets.\n\nI look forward to seeing the representation of the film industry at COP27. Having read McLean Sibanda\u2019s book; Nuts & Bolt, I am seeking to answer: \u201cWhat is the place of communication, film and policy in the wave of emerging technologies.

Review them constantly to ascertain if you are still on course. Some terrains are steep giving one the reason to want to seat and give up! But resilience dictates one must keep going.

A trendsetter named Top 40 Under 40 Most Influential Women in Kenya in 2011; the only woman in public service at the time to get such recognition.\n\nAn economist, she describes herself as a pragmatic leader and diligent public servant who always upholds excellence in performance.\n\nShe was elected Governor of Kirinyaga County in 2017, in a tightly contested gubernatorial election where she emerged as one of the first three women Governors in Kenya.\n\n1. Briefly introduce yourself. Who is Anne Waiguru?\n\nI am a woman who believes that women have what it takes to take up the roles in the highest levels of their country\u2019s public and corporate leadership.\n\nCurrently, I am spearheading the socio-economic and political development for one of the country\u2019s vibrant devolved units inhabited by approximately 610,000 people. I am also a wife and a mother.\n\n2. Talk to us about your career journey highlighting the significant achievements and the events around them?\n\nMany know me from serving in the public sector but before this, I worked at Citibank, the World Bank, and in Civil Society specifically at Transparency International-Kenya, where I was a principal research analyst and a consultant for the National Council of NGOs and the Kenya Human Rights Commission (KHRC).\n\nIn the mainstream public service, I served as a technical advisor during President Mwai Kibaki\u2019s Government on secondment by the World Bank, and later by the United Nations Development Program (UNDP). Thereafter, I joined the National Treasury as Head of Governance, where I also served as the alternate to the Permanent Secretary of the National Treasury in the Women Enterprise Fund Board and the Public Procurement Oversight Authority and Advisory Board.\n\nLater, I was appointed Head of the Economic Stimulus Programme and the Director of Integrated Financial Management System (IFMIS) between 2007 and 2012. Through sheer hard work at the National Treasury, I led the IFMIS team to win three awards for exemplary performance and was named among the Top 40 Under 40 Most Influential Women in Kenya in 2011; the only woman in public service at the time to get such recognition.\n\nThen in April 2013, I transitioned into President Uhuru Kenyatta\u2019s Government as the first Devolution Cabinet Secretary. I was tasked with the responsibility of overseeing the country\u2019s shift from a centralized to a devolved system of Government. As Devolution CS, I won a total of 15 awards in Africa and globally, including the 2015 United Nations Public Service Award following recognition by the Africa Association of Public Administration and Management, for ensuring efficiency in Public Service delivery and introducing one-stop service delivery centres called Huduma Centres.\n\nKenyans can attest that Huduma centres have eased access to Government services, such as registration of business entities, application for e-driving licenses, application and replacement of lost identity cards, and other related public services.\n\nGiven the need to ensure women as part of the marginalized people were empowered economically, I successfully championed the reservation of 30% Government contracts for marginalized groups, which is now a legally recognized general principle of procurement and asset disposal in Kenya and is implemented through Access to Government Procurement Opportunities (AGPO).\n\nImmediately after the 2017 General elections, I was elected Vice-Chairperson of the Council of Governors (CoGs) where I played a major role in negotiations between the national Governments and county Governments due to my past work experience.\n\n3. With such an accomplished career life, paint for us a picture of what it means to be a woman in a Senior Management role in Politics and Governance; a sector that many women easily shy away from.\n\nTo be a woman in a senior management in politics and governance takes commitment and hard work. Like many women leaders across the globe and Kenya in particular, I have often had to work twice or thrice as hard to clinch any position dominated by men.\n\nFor instance, when I fronted my name for Vice-Chairperson of the Council of Governors against three other male candidates, in a room full of 44 men and only two other women, I had to put up a strong case that would persuade the newly elected male Governors to elect me.\n\nIn my political life, I have also had to deal with the ills of negative publicity fuelled by political opponents who believed I was rising faster than a woman should. Social media has made it even harder as the rate at which information, true or false, is disseminated is very fast. To make matters worse, the arguments against women often focus on mundane issues such as their physical looks rather than on their ideas and leadership capabilities.\n\nHowever, these challenges fuel my drive, my undoubted resilience, commitment to excellence, and ability to deliver complex tasks. Now I can say that the experience has elevated me to the level I am in. I believe that transformative leadership should be focused on influencing positive change in individuals and social systems that have hindered gender equality.\n\nI am currently serving as the Chairperson of the Gender, Youth, Sports, Culture, and Social services committee at the Council of Governors. I believe that women leaders should band together to achieve equality in the social-economic and political landscapes in our countries.\n\n4. From your experience over the years, how would you encourage women to a greater awareness that they can break barriers, influence, and occupy decision-making positions?\n\nIn my perspective, gender equality can no longer be a footnote. All women must commit to contribute towards an equitable and inclusive Kenya where we get enough women believing in themselves and coming out to fight for their spaces.\n\nWomen leadership is still greatly hampered by many obstacles including blatant and subtle attitudes and beliefs that women cannot reach leadership domains traditionally assigned to men.\n\nEven though there has been quite some progress towards achieving gender parity, much more still needs to be done to have more women elected into political offices. As it is currently, women have to put in much more effort in convincing the electorate to elect them than their male counterparts.\n\nMy advice to the women is, however, not to shy away from dreaming to achieve their leadership goals. They must believe they have what it takes to bring tangible change in areas that affect them since they understand better the unique interests of women and girls. We must find a common ground that will help us bring new dignity and respect to women and girls.\n\nOffering mentorship to women is therefore, critical towards the achievement of gender equality since it not only opens doors for them to break the glass ceiling but it ignites the fire and the push for them to achieve their maximum potential.\n\nIt also means that there will be more women moving up which forms the foundation of a valuable professional network that will benefit women and enhance advocacy on their issues at high levels.\n\n5. Let\u2019s talk about women\u2019s empowerment. As a champion for gender equity in society, how do you go about encouraging women to achieve their highest potential?\n\nResponding to the need to ensure increased active participation of more women leaders in Kenya, I have been a champion of constitutional reforms that would enable us to comply with the two-thirds (2/3) gender rule entrenched in the country\u2019s current 2010 Constitution.\n\nIn the current constitutional regime, the two-thirds gender rule has been deemed unimplementable for the absence of mechanisms on how to realize the principle in appointive and elective positions. I have been actively engaged as a key strategist to ensure that women are equally engaged on all fronts for the key purpose of ensuring their holistic development. It is a trite fact that a nation is empowered when its women, young and old alike, are empowered.\n\n6. You say that your purpose in life is to grow people with energy and to inspire them to unleash their potential. Briefly tell us some of the ways you have done so and key lessons you have learnt while living out your purpose.\n\n\u2756 Transformative leadership is about influencing positive change in individuals and social systems for the betterment of society. My current capacity as Governor allows me to actively advocate for the interests of the public within the region, I govern concerning devolved functions.\n\nUpon assumption of office after the 2017 elections, I developed a Sessional Paper dubbed The Mountain Cities Blueprint 2032 which captured my agenda and vision for the county. Through it, we have been undertaking wealth-creation development programs whose tangible benefits to the public are now evident.\n\n\u2756 We, therefore, developed an end-to-end economic stimulus program that we named Wezesha which is a Kiswahili name meaning \u2018empower\u2019. Through Wezesha we have so far supported more than 500 farmers groups and close to 50,000 households to undertake various projects. Each of the supported households makes an extra Ksh. 1,000 per day under various value chains which include production of 1 million eggs a month under poultry keeping, tomato, avocado, dairy and fish farming, beekeeping as well as pig rearing.\n\n\u2756 To provide a conducive environment for our traders, most of who deal in fresh produce, we have so far constructed 15 modern markets in various towns. To transform our urban centres, we have also constructed about 25,000 square meters of cabro car parks and pavements in our major towns such as Kerugoya, Kutus, Kagio, Kianyaga and currently we are undertaking 30,000 square meters of cabro paving in Wang\u2019uru town.\n\n\u2756 Towards the achievement of Universal Health Coverage, we have undertaken massive infrastructural and service delivery reforms in our health facilities. Our legacy project in health is the upcoming five-storey ultra-modern medical complex that aims at elevating Kerugoya Level Four Hospital to a Level Five Referral Hospital. This facility will enable us to offer the specialized medical services for which residents are currently referred to other hospitals.\n\nThe ultra-modern hospital, which has an ICU, an HDU, an oncology centre and a burns unit among other state-of-the-art amenities, will be the first one in the region to match the standards of some of the country\u2019s most reputable private hospitals.\n\nWe are also upgrading Kimbimbi and Kianyaga Hospitals from level 3 to level 4 facilities. This is in addition to the 19 dispensaries we are completing and equipping to boost the provision of primary healthcare at the grassroots.\n\n7. If you were to reflect on your career journey, what would you say has been the guiding principle(s) or values that keep you grounded in life?\n\nMy unshakable commitment to good governance against great odds, democracy, transformative learning, human rights, the right to excellent service delivery, and the rule of law drive my decisions as a civil servant, a political leader, and in my personal life.\n\n8. Away from work, share with us some of your life experiences on personal growth and development?\n\nHaving been selected to join the Amujae Leader in the 2021 Cohort, at Ellen Johnson Sirleaf Presidential Center for Women and Leadership (EJS Center) earlier in the year, I am learning a lot from my mentors such as Ellen Johnson who has been the President in Liberia. I cherish every opportunity that equips me with the confidence required to seek the highest positions of public leadership.\n\nThe program is designed to address the underrepresentation of women in public leadership in Africa and ensure that women become equal players in setting the national priorities of their respective countries.\n\nI am committed to playing my role in mentoring other young women in leadership and politics. I want to be counted among the women who have positively impacted Africa women leadership.\n\nAny parting shot?\n\nIt is said that, if you are not on the table, you are on the menu. Women have been on the menu for far too long, and for us who are on the table now, we should make it count! We should also be the voice for the voiceless and hope for those who have lost hope.

Briefly tell us about your entry into career life and some memorable moments.\n\nMy career dates back to the Inysder magazine where I began as a junior writer. I rose to be a top editor for the magazine. It\u2019s while at the Inysder that I met a friend, the late Brian Weyama, who pushed me to maximize my potential.\n\nWhile working alongside him, I learnt Project management. While working at the Inysder magazine, I participated in the creation of various brands including: Always, Aquafresh, Colgate, Cadbury Chocolate, Nokia, Coca-Cola, just to name but a few. This is one of my proudest moments. Inysder magazine is an umbrella of Teenwise Media Agency that bore two other agencies within. I can\u2019t also credit my success without mentioning Gina Din Kariuki. I had the privileged to pass through her mentorship when I was starting.\n\nThat was an eye-opener for me and laid a firm foundation for my PR practice. I am also a certified Animator from Shangtao Media which also couples as a part of my success journey. This has seen me tap into my creative side and have a keen eye for details.\n\n2. You were the brains behind the SSS3 campaign (Super Senator Sakaja) that saw Johnson Sakaja get into Parliament as the current Nairobi County Senator. Please share with us your experience working on this and some of the lessons from running a political campaign.\n\nThe campaign was a great success attributed to teamwork. I worked on several projects during the campaign period in 2017, because I was also incorporated in the Hon Kiraitu Murungi campaign of Meru County.\n\nMy role was to develop strategies. My greatest lesson through the process is that we should not assume that early success when launching a new program means the results will be what you promised a client.\n\n3. You have risen the ranks from a PR manager at OPPO Kenya to Head of Corporate Communications and Projects at OPPO Kenya. Please walk us through your career journey and some of your most successful career moments and the events that have shaped these.\n\nI joined OPPO about three years ago, which has been an answered prayer. The environment has pushed and stretched me in equal measure and allowed me to grow. I love the brand and telling its story.\n\nI have enjoyed each product launch that I have coordinated from conception to execution together with my team and our PR Agency. Everything about the launches has allowed me to learn. I have fallen in love with the tech world. I have evolved and I have become.\n\nMy greatest support at OPPO is my CEO Rey Huan, an amazing gentleman who has allowed me to be. He has allowed me to flap my wings and fly, to take the brand to new heights and levels.\n\nAs I look back at the milestones of the brand, I am grateful to see the many things that I once spoke of as just an idea being actualized now. Above all, I am grateful for all the strong women who have gone ahead of me.\n\nThey continue to serve as my lens at the top and hold my hand as I chatter in my career path. They have loved me, corrected me, criticized me and picked me up; they have fixed my crown and made me realize that we all need to have women who speak words of wisdom into our lives.\n\nMuthoni Wachira\n\n4. a) As a young woman in senior management where your contribution makes a difference in decision making, what does this role mean to you and other women as well as younger girls watching you?\n\nI believe anyone of us can become. We can succeed, however, you choose to define success. This has turned out to be the greatest gift I could have given myself. As women, we often have many things to prove to ourselves, one of which is that we can live our lives fearlessly.\n\nI have since learnt that failure is a part of success. A lot can be learned when plans go awry. So now I encourage young girls and women to go ahead and fail. The world looks different from the ground. You can never fail if you refuse to lose, especially if you have the necessary self-awareness. I call this turning your wounds into wisdom.\n\nb) Any three lessons on leadership you have learnt so far worth sharing?\n\n\u2022 Becoming Muthoni. I believe in myself, being compassionate and courageous. Your story is what you have and will always have. It is something to own.\n\n\u2022 Remain true to yourself. Never let what somebody else says distract you from your goals. I continue to learn that the choices of life are many, but it\u2019s essential to believe in yourself and your values. Whenever faced with the question, \u201cAm I good enough?\u201d even if you struggle to say \u201cYes\u201d say \u201cYes!.\u201d Don\u2019t let your mistakes pull you down. Learn from them, and raise the standard of meeting your values every day. It\u2019s vital to experience risks, criticism in extreme forms, but we should always earn respect through integrity.\n\n\u2022 Leadership means authenticity. As a leader, when I show up as who I truly am and speak from my values\u2013this is where connection happens. People are moved because they resonate with an authentic leader. Speaking from the heart is one of the most powerful ways to deeply connect with an audience, and build the trust needed for truly powerful leadership.\n\n5. Tell us what role has each of the following aspects played in your career life-giving brief real-life experiences?\n\n\u2022 Pursuing your passion. I am exactly where I have always wanted to be. As a young girl, I loved speaking to the audience. I grew up admiring Oprah Winfrey and how eloquent she is, and I was determined to speak right in front of an audience one day.\n\n\u2022 Forging networks. I have been in rooms with movers and shakers. I have also made some very incredible friends in the industry; Nana Gecaga, Sandra Ochola, Slyvia Mulinge, just to name a few of the women who have been instrumental in the woman I am becoming.\n\n\u2022 Taking risks. At one time, I resigned from a Government job without a game plan. Those around me were concerned that I was making a huge risk for my career. However, it was this jump that led me to OPPO Kenya.\n\n\u2022 Mentorship. This is close to my heart. I have been a mentee to various people including renowned political analyst Prof Peter Kagwanja who taught me a lot about politics. This gave me the knowledge and understanding of Political PR and grew my interest in the political field. I have been in the same room and worked on projects that involved the Presidency including the 2017 elections. Those are some of the projects that have allowed me to come this far. My greatest mentor is Sandra Ochola, the president\u2019s speechwriter. She still holds my hand to this very day.\n\nMuthoni Wachira\n\n6. If you were to choose values that are most important to you that shape the way you work and live, what would they be and why?\n\n\u2022 Being authentic and intentional. My parents have always taught me how to keep owning my story and who I am. I don\u2019t need to fit in. They have also instilled in me the value of being intentional by doing what I said I would do and also by nurturing my friendships. I love the women and friendships in my life as we get to discuss real-life issues and be vulnerable without fear.\n\n\u2022 Diversification. Challenges are gifts that force us to search for a new centre of gravity. Don\u2019t fight them. Just find a new way to stand. Throughout my career, I have diversified and worked in different environments which have opened me up to opportunities that I never imagined. I have also learnt a lot more than a classroom setting ever taught me.\n\n\u2022 Spread Optimism. I am a woman in the process. I\u2019m just trying like everybody else. I try to take every conflict and experience as a lesson. Life is never dull. If there is one thing to learn from my mother, it is how to live life with optimism. She has displayed this quality in every step of her life, rising from every challenge and looking forward to a new sunrise every time.\n\n7. When you think about women breaking the glass ceilings and their space up the corporate ladder, what does the future look like?\n\nFor me, the future is innovative, with both men and women. We are raising young boys and girls and I believe that these are the people who are going to change the game and do more than we\u2019ve achieved. Mine is to encourage women out here as we emphasize that the future is female, we need to ensure that we create gender equality all around us such that we can all co-exist and do amazing things together for the future!\n\nAny parting shot?\n\nStay true to who you are. It doesn\u2019t matter who is for you and who isn\u2019t. What matters is that you believe in yourself. As a woman evolving every minute and second, I am always and constantly reminding myself of the importance of being in touch with who I am. Accept who I am as I look forward to becoming.\n\nI would encourage my younger sisters not to shy away from those uncomfortable conversations. Realize that everything does happen with a reason and a purpose. I have outgrown so many things, people, places and spaces, and that have been the curves for me. To learn, unlearn, relearn among the many things in this life. You are, always will be for a reason.

A Political Scientist and Journalist with 16 years of experience; 13 of which have been in the newsroom.\n\nShe describes herself as a village girl who by God\u2019s grace continues to survive the odds that life throws at her, by utilizing opportunities and taking risks while ensuring that her life is meaningful and positively contributes to societal well-being.\n\nShe is fearless; once she was summoned to Parliament after she and a colleague wrote investigative stories exposing corruption among members of Parliament. Today, she is the Press Freedom, Safety, and Advocacy Manager at the Media Council of Kenya.\n\nDinnah Ondari\u2019s career in journalism began in 2004 after graduating with a Diploma in Journalism and Mass Communication. \u201cOne year later, I got an internship opportunity at the People Daily Newspaper. Those early days of my career were the most challenging, partly because I had zero networks in the media industry. In addition, my knowledge of the city was non-existent. I recall having a hard time tracing the building where I was to report for my internship. Finally, I made my way there.\n\nAfter six months of the internship, they absorbed me as a correspondent. But even the change of position did not make things any better for me. As a correspondent, salaries never came on time; however, our employer always ensured we had Ksh. 700 at the end of every week for transport to work.\n\nDespite these financial problems, the newsroom I worked for had a vibrant environment for the development of talent. Emerging from an astute reputation as a bold weekly that delivered earth-shattering stories in the 90\u2019s, the People Daily newspaper attracted some of the best brains in journalism whose mentorship I benefitted from as a young journalist.\n\nMost of the senior and acclaimed journalists began their careers at this point. Out of interest to report on issues of governance, I was assigned to join the parliamentary team in 2006.\n\nThis is when I made the connection between politics and life. Having interacted with legislative reporting, observed political processes and the role of media in setting the agenda on issues of governance, I felt challenged to further my education to enable me to make sense of life around me. I graduated from the University of Nairobi (UoN) in December 2009 with a double major in Journalism and Political Science.\n\nMy thirst for education took me back to UoN in 2010 to pursue Masters in Political Science and Public Administration. By this time, the financial fortunes of my employer had improved, and I had also grown through the ranks to become a Deputy News Editor.\n\nI had had a stint on TV where I did news analysis, and I led the newspapers, parliamentary team.\n\nFile image of Dinnah Ondari\n\nAfter more than a decade in the newsroom and having graduated with my Master\u2019s degree in 2016, I started introspecting on the future of my career.\n\nMy heart yearned for more. Even though I had previously attempted to leave the newsroom unsuccessfully, this time round the urge was overwhelming. In 2018, in my incessant search for a new job, a friend shared a job advertisement. I applied and as they say, the rest is history.\n\nMy current job has offered the challenges I had anticipated, and more, which means that the levels of satisfaction have been surpassed. Challenges push you to think, utilize your brain and explore new territories in search of solutions.\n\nMy knowledge and experience in political science and journalism make it easier for me to contribute to the Media Council\u2019s interventions in articulating policy issues and the work of media, identify and respond to gaps, and do advocacy on the same.\n\nHaving faced the challenges as a journalist myself, I respond to issues of safety of journalists and press freedom violations not only as a matter of duty but from my heart.\n\n1. Tell us some of your biggest accomplishments/ proud moments and the events that have shaped your career journey.\n\nOne of my proud moments in my career, which was also the riskiest, was when together with my colleague at People Daily, Anthony Mwangi, we published investigative stories about corruption among members of parliament (MPs).\n\nThis earned us summons by the Speaker of the National Assembly, on the floor of the House. We were expected to appear before the committee of powers and privileges to testify about our stories and name our sources.\n\nWith pressure from individuals MPs and now summons staring at us, Nairobi became very small for us. But thanks to efforts by the Group Managing Editor who stood by our stories and the Media Council of Kenya who marshalled the industry to rally behind us, the summons were not executed. Looking back, I think fate was preparing me for the work I now do at the Media Council.\n\nI later served as the Secretary-General of the Kenya Parliamentary Journalists Association (KPJA). My belief is that leadership is an opportunity to serve.\n\nTherefore, my stint at KPJA marked a new dawn for the Association as more women had started expressing interest in leading the association which articulates the interests of parliamentary journalists as far as the relationship between parliament and media is concerned.\n\nMy deputy was also a lady and I am glad this trend has continued. The KPJA office was able to expand freedom of expression within the association as well as spearhead cooperation and respect between parliament and members, which is critical in creating a conducive working environment for journalists working in parliament.\n\n2. Given an opportunity to advise young women who want to establish themselves as journalists, what would you tell them?\n\nLike politics, journalism is not a walk in the park and especially for women journalists. There will be challenges that threaten to overwhelm you, such as wrong assumptions and generalizations/stereotypes, and sexual harassment. But all these can be overcome with the right skills, passion, determination, positive attitude, integrity and prayer.\n\nOften, opportunities come dressed in gowns that look like work, do not doubt your ability to cope. Most of the challenges you face come from people who are scared of your mere potential.\n\n3. As the country gears up to next year\u2019s General Election, tell us some measures that the Media Council of Kenya is taking to ensure media preparedness countrywide and why every journalist in Kenya should strive to be a member of MCK.\n\nThe Council has developed a comprehensive strategy on election preparedness including:\n\n\uf0d8 Collaboration with the media to ensure it plays its civic role to educate Kenyans on the importance of participating and electing responsible leaders, and it's watchdog role to ensure transparency in electoral processes.\n\n\uf0d8 Work with stakeholders in the media sector to conduct County-based journalists\u2019 training on election reporting.\n\n\uf0d8 Review of the Safety and Protection Mechanism for journalists, which will be signed by the Media Owners and Editors as a commitment to ensure the safety of journalists.\n\n\uf0d8 Review of the Election Reporting Guidelines to enhance reportage on electoral processes. This will be an industry-led process.\n\n\uf0d8 Training of Trainers on the Election Reporting Guidelines and Election Training Manual.\n\n\uf0d8 MCK will put up Media Centres for journalists to work from during the election period.\n\n\uf0d8 Provision of grants for journalists to produce in-depth stories on the election. The journalists will work with mentors as a way of enhancing their capacity for election reporting.\n\n\uf0d8 Media Monitoring during the electioneering period on hate speech, fake news, and trends. This will provide a feedback loop on the performance of the media.\n\n\uf0d8 Work with the IEBC to accredit journalists for election reporting and coverage. Being an accredited member of the Council is important for journalists as it accords you several privileges:\n\n\uf0a7 Access to news sites/places, protection in case of press freedom violations.\n\n\uf0a7 Access to training opportunities offered by the Council.\n\n\uf0a7 An accreditation card is one of the requirements for eligibility when applying for the Annual Journalism and Excellence Awards.\n\n\uf0a7 Favourable hearing at the Media Complaints Commission. MCK accreditation is a symbol of credibility as a professional.\n\n4. The unemployment rate and mental health issues have been on the rise in Kenya, affecting many people and especially in the media. What are your thoughts around the same? How can people deal with these issues?\n\nThe COVID-19 has no doubt exacerbated unemployment in the country. The media industry was among the sectors with over 1200 journalists being affected by salary cuts, job losses, and infections. These negative effects took a toll on many journalists and media workers due to the loss of revenue and status.\n\nAs a response, the Council has been leading the industry interventions to cushion individual journalists and media houses through grants direct support, psychological counselling.\n\nThe Council is also setting up a media support fund in a more sustainable way. These efforts can effectively be replicated in other sectors of the economy if customized to respond to the needs of the targets groups.\n\nDinnah Ondari\n\n5. If you were to choose two values that are most im portant to you that shape the way you work and live, what would they be and why?\n\n\uf0fc Emotional Intelligence. This is as equally important as having a high IQ. Emotional Intelligence will help you manage yourself, situations, and relationships with others in a manner that is objective and practical.\n\n\uf0fc Fear of God. God before everything, after all, he owns the universe.\n\n6. How do you describe yourself, and how do others describe you?\n\nI am determined, intelligent, hardworking, results-oriented, humorous, and extroverted/introverted.\n\nOthers describe me as hardworking, team player, go-getter, intelligent and perceptive. I can be a little impatient and stubborn especially when something I truly believe in isn\u2019t working out or there are unnecessary delays.\n\n7. As part of your parting shot, what will you tell your 25-year-old self?\n\nAll trees are judged by the quality of fruits they produce. But little attention is given to the amount it takes to nurture and entrench the tree\u2019s roots to make it produce. Similarly, a lot of time effort, and resources go into the process of setting up a foundation of a house, which is usually buried on the ground. But once it is done, the focus is usually given to other aspects that people can see and what is beneficial to them. In short, preparing for a future you want may be costly, lonely, and often thankless, but the fruits will be worthwhile. You must do your part; leave the rest to God.", "articleBodyHtml": "<article>\n\n<p>In our segment of #KenyaWomenSeries, we feature, Dinnah Ondari.\u00a0A Political Scientist and Journalist with 16 years of experience; 13 of which have been in the newsroom.</p>\n\n<p>She describes herself as a village girl who by God\u2019s grace continues to survive the odds that life throws at her, by utilizing opportunities and taking risks while ensuring that her life is meaningful and positively contributes to societal well-being.</p>\n\n<p>She is fearless; once she was summoned to Parliament after she and a colleague wrote investigative stories exposing corruption among members of Parliament. Today, she is the Press Freedom, Safety, and Advocacy Manager at the Media Council of Kenya.</p>\n\n<p>Dinnah Ondari\u2019s career in journalism began in 2004 after graduating with a Diploma in Journalism and Mass Communication. \u201cOne year later, I got an internship opportunity at the People Daily Newspaper. Those early days of my career were the most challenging, partly because I had zero networks in the media industry. In addition, my knowledge of the city was non-existent. I recall having a hard time tracing the building where I was to report for my internship. Finally, I made my way there.</p>\n\n<p>After six months of the internship, they absorbed me as a correspondent. But even the change of position did not make things any better for me. As a correspondent, salaries never came on time; however, our employer always ensured we had Ksh. 700 at the end of every week for transport to work.</p>\n\n<p>Despite these financial problems, the newsroom I worked for had a vibrant environment for the development of talent. Emerging from an astute reputation as a bold weekly that delivered earth-shattering stories in the 90\u2019s, the People Daily newspaper attracted some of the best brains in journalism whose mentorship I benefitted from as a young journalist.</p>\n\n<p>Most of the senior and acclaimed journalists began their careers at this point. Out of interest to report on issues of governance, I was assigned to join the parliamentary team in 2006.</p>\n\n<p>This is when I made the connection between politics and life. Having interacted with legislative reporting, observed political processes and the role of media in setting the agenda on issues of governance, I felt challenged to further my education to enable me to make sense of life around me. I graduated from the University of Nairobi (UoN) in December 2009 with a double major in Journalism and Political Science.</p>\n\n<p>My thirst for education took me back to UoN in 2010 to pursue Masters in Political Science and Public Administration. By this time, the financial fortunes of my employer had improved, and I had also grown through the ranks to become a Deputy News Editor.</p>\n\n<p>I had had a stint on TV where I did news analysis, and I led the newspapers, parliamentary team.</p>\n\n<p><img src=\"https://www.nairobileo.co.ke/uploads/posts/IMG-20210915175746.jpeg\"><br></p>\n\n<p><em>File image of Dinnah Ondari</em></p>\n\n<p>After more than a decade in the newsroom and having graduated with my Master\u2019s degree in 2016, I started introspecting on the future of my career.</p>\n\n<p>My heart yearned for more. Even though I had previously attempted to leave the newsroom unsuccessfully, this time round the urge was overwhelming. In 2018, in my incessant search for a new job, a friend shared a job advertisement. I applied and as they say, the rest is history.</p>\n\n<p>My current job has offered the challenges I had anticipated, and more, which means that the levels of satisfaction have been surpassed.

An award-winning Kenyan film maker/TV Producer, Director, and Screenwriter.\n\nShe is also a PhD candidate studying Communications at Jomo Kenyatta University of Agriculture and Technology (JKUAT).\n\nShe has produced over 70 documentaries and shows including Churchill Live Show and written scripts for popular Kenyan TV shows including Tahidi High, Mother-in-Law among others. Some of her documentaries are research tools on disability in Africa, in Harvard and YALE universities.\n\nShe has produced a short film called Brother Brother that saw her travel to five continents attending film festivals where it was showcased.\n\nSheila Mulinya began her career journey at the Kenya Institute of Mass Communication (KIMC) where she enrolled for a Diploma in Film Production.\n\n\u201cDespite passing several interviews I could not get an admission in other institutions; and when I did, the only available vacancy was in the Film class. I had no idea what Film was though I had watched many movies before. All I knew was that I wanted to study at KIMC, so I settled in albeit three days to the end of the first semester. Still, I emerged among the top three students in the class at the end of that semester. As they say, the rest is history.\n\nUkweli Video Productions which by then was the largest Christian Video Production House in Africa gave me a launching pad even without any professional experience. My beloved boss then, the Late Rev. Fr. Richard J. Quinn, who owned Ukweli production, was impressed that I went back to thank him with a copy of my school project as he had given me some footage to include in the video that I produced for examination at KIMC. That day he offered me the job. I was both scared and excited that I only told my parents about it 6 days later!\n\nUnder the mentorship of Fr. Richard, I was able to produce, direct, write and voice over 58 documentaries on a number of social and topical issues. We produced documentaries ranging from Evangelizing, Health, Social, and Development issues. Many of our films were based on reproductive health, abortion, HIV/AIDS, tuberculosis, diabetes, farming to name but a few.\n\nAfter an illustrious six years, I left Ukweli as an all-rounded producer at a time when Fr. Richard was going into retirement. I started working on local television shows and had to be adaptable. Coming from a day job into independent practice needed adjusting which had its own rigours but I managed. I worked as a Production coordinator for the then Churchill Live Show with Bob Nyanja at Cinematic Solutions where I had an opportunity to produce a Wedding Show titled Ndoa that aired on NTV. Njanja was different; he was very keen to detail.\n\nMy stint at the Churchill show saw me manage the welfare of a team of over 40 crew members. I collected shooting equipment from suppliers, oversaw the whole production process, and delivered equipment to suppliers. This kept me on my toes. I sharpened live recording skills and the demands of producing such a high cluster kind of a show. Churchill was at that time the most-watched TV show in East Africa; a high pressure show to produce but very exciting.\n\nI then joined Tahidi High as a novice Scriptwriter. Working with Producer Catherine Wamuyu whose patience and consistency saw me write for the show for over two years when she had turned me back over six times because my scripts weren\u2019t good enough, was quite an experience. She simply never gave up on me and I soon started writing some of my most memorable scripts. Each episode I wrote was an enthralling experience as I saw stories take shape and get their own life. The network I created at Tahidi High saw me write Inspekta Mwala and Mother-In \u2013Law TV shows too.\n\nThen, it was time to return to school. I went to Moi University for my Bachelor of Science in Communication with a major in Public Relations, then to the University of Nairobi for my Master of Arts in Communication studies, and to Harvard for my Copyright Law Certificate. I am currently writing my proposal for my PhD studies in Mass Communication. Perhaps, I will do another Masters, this time round, in policy.\n\n1. With your experience in teaching at various institutions of higher learning in Kenya, how would you describe the status of women lecturers in Kenya?\n\nWhat are some of the challenges that women face when climbing up the career ladder within the academic circles and how best can they navigate these challenges?\n\nI have taught at KIMC and St. Paul\u2019s University and currently, I teach Film as a part-time lecturer at USIU-Africa. Mentoring budding filmmakers through my classes that are usually experience-based has presented a great opportunity for me to build my CV, my public speaking skills, and an opportunity to impact and inspire my students.\n\nWomen lecturers in Kenya especially in technical film courses are few. I hope that there will be a change in the future. Many countries are eyeing a creative economy and this is a role many women should be a part of. Some of the challenges that women face while climbing the career ladder within academic circles are that they must balance many other responsibilities like motherhood, stereotypes that only men can teach technical courses like camerawork and sound. But this isn\u2019t true.\n\nTo navigate these challenges, women need to be aggressive, hands on and to look at the bigger picture that includes the balance in opportunities that the film industry presents to all of us. Determination should be the ultimate driver for any woman who is looking to join the academic circle.\n\n2. You have spent many years of your career doing productions. What are some of the lessons you\u2019ve learnt that can be helpful to those aspiring to join the media industry, especially in production?\n\n\uf0fc Audience is king. Sometimes the back stories make up for more exciting stories than the main stories that I produce. Ultimately, I am a storyteller and it is something that I keep going back to. Telling stories through TV shows is highly addictive to me and it never seems to go out of fashion in my world. Keeping your audience entertained or informed is very fulfilling.\n\n\uf0fc Teamwork, honesty, patience, consistency get you the success. It is never easy to get a TV show on air as an independent content producer. Respect and listen to everyone on your team they all know something you don't know. TV Production is like a bicycle chain, one bad link and you're stuck. Don\u2019t give up on your vocabulary; sometimes success comes after several attempts.\n\n\uf0fc There will be lots of sacrifices. I have had to get logbook loans from shylocks to shoot pilots and we know how that goes. I have asked my parents for money to sustain some of my shows. I have had to cook breakfast for my cast and crew when I had limited funds to pay for catering services. I have had to multitask, wake up early and sleep very late just to keep some of my shows running. I am grateful to be surrounded by friends who believe in my dreams and support me whenever I call upon them for a new project.\n\n3. What does the future look like for women in production? Do we have many women behind the camera now compared to when you were starting out? What is your take on leveling the ground? Please share your experience with us.\n\nThere is hope! Technological advancements and the internet are promising for women in production. Look at all the YouTubers and Vloggers with their cameras that keep churning tones and tones of great content to the masses. Today many newsrooms have female news directors, but this was not the case before. More women are getting behind the camera and creating great content that is competing evenly with that of their male counterparts.\n\nI am proud of all the women who defy stereotypes in storytelling and fly back home with those international nominations and awards. That says that in the coming days, we shall all share in the piece of cake that will come with a vibrant creative economy for TV and Film producers. We are all leaving an indelible mark on the canvas of local television content creation.\n\nIn the course of her work, Sheila has received some awards and global recognitions. These include;\n\n\uf0d8 Ghana Students International Film Festival and Israel Film festival.\n\n\uf0d8 Harvard and Yale; some of her documentaries are research tools on disability in Africa.\n\n\uf0d8 Chicago Film Festival for a short film for kids.\n\n\uf0d8 Durban best pitch for a Documentary Film that she will be producing soon.\n\n\uf0d8 Meeting the pope during one of her assignments in Australia.\n\nSheila Joy Mulinya\n\n5. Given an opportunity to re-imagine the world (for women and girls), is there is anything you would change?\n\nYes. I would change the notion that men are better than women in technical jobs. Given the same level playground, women perform just as well as men. Women are capable and times continue to show us that indeed, yes they are and can be trusted just like men.\n\n6. What role has each of the following aspects played in your career experiences?\n\n\u2022 Pursuing your passion. Without distance there is no journey. Had I not followed my passion, I wouldn\u2019t be where I am today. I urge all of us to grasp every opportunity to learn something new with zeal and determination. Attempt to unlearn any habits that deter you from improving yourself. Walk out of completed projects with honour and decorum. Renewed contracts have a propensity to join a link that properly connects to a previous connection that worked successfully.\n\n\u2022 Forging network. The universe is not an island and none of us has it all. Value your networks as links that will sell your brand and optimize your capabilities. It is in forging great networks that we can have what we do not have. I literally have a fall back plan for whichever need that arises whenever I am engaged in a production thanks to the great networks that I have forged.\n\n\u2022 Taking risks. Business persons must be able to have a nose for good opportunities and the tendency to cherry pick engagements that will translate into profits. Take risks however always do a risk analysis first. When the deal is too good think twice.\n\n\u2022 Mentorship. For growth to occur, we have to look up to those who have been there before us and transformed what we hope to transform. Walk tall in the shadows of those who inspire you. There is that gratifying element of joy in learning from others.\n\n7. If you were to choose two values that are most important to you that shape the way you work and live, what would they be and why?\n\nI value time keeping, writing and speaking good grammar and hard work. People who keep time and write good grammar will always stick out as neat, professional, and easy to trust. Those impeccable work ethics define and guide me. I don\u2019t stop until the job is done and done well. It is a virtue that earns me referrals for new jobs and connections.\n\n8. Any parting shot?\n\nIt is appalling that in 2021 as a country we are yet to achieve the required 40 per cent quota on local television content within 2 years of opening the channel and 60 per cent soon after. I don\u2019t understand the obsession for foreign content and politics when we haven\u2019t even scratched the surface in telling our own stories.\n\nPolitics has its space in shaping the society we live in but a creative economy has a lot to offer particularly to the super talented Kenyans while offering job opportunities to the thousands who are training and graduating to join it.\n\nWe have a rich cultural heritage that needs to be shared with the world. We might not as a country provide jobs for everyone but I feel that the local television content production sector would cover a lot of these gaps with focus and finances fully invested into it. Let\u2019s be wise about how well we want to utilise and optimise the talents that God has bestowed unto us.", "articleBodyHtml": "<article>\n\n<p>In our segment of #KenyaWomenSeries, we feature, Sheila Joy Mulinya.\u00a0An award-winning Kenyan film maker/TV Producer, Director, and Screenwriter.</p>\n\n<p>She is also a PhD candidate studying Communications at Jomo Kenyatta University of Agriculture and Technology (JKUAT).</p>\n\n<p>She has produced over 70 documentaries and shows including Churchill Live Show and written scripts for popular Kenyan TV shows including Tahidi High, Mother-in-Law among others. Some of her documentaries are research tools on disability in Africa, in Harvard and YALE universities.</p>\n\n<p>She has produced a short film called Brother Brother that saw her  travel to five continents attending film festivals where it was showcased.</p>\n\n<p>Sheila Mulinya began her career journey at the Kenya Institute of Mass Communication (KIMC) where she enrolled for a Diploma in Film Production.</p>\n\n<p>\u201cDespite passing several interviews I could not get an admission in other institutions; and when I did, the only available vacancy was in the Film class. I had no idea what Film was though I had watched many movies before. All I knew was that I wanted to study at KIMC, so I settled in albeit three days to the end of the first semester. Still, I emerged among the top three students in the class at the end of that semester. As they say, the rest is history.</p>\n\n<p>Ukweli Video Productions which by then was the largest Christian Video Production House in Africa gave me a launching pad even without any professional experience. My beloved boss then, the Late Rev. Fr. Richard J. Quinn, who owned Ukweli production, was impressed that I went back to thank him with a copy of my school project as he had given me some footage to include in the video that I produced for examination at KIMC. That day he offered me the job.  I was both scared and excited that I only told my parents about it 6 days later!</p>\n\n<p>Under the mentorship of Fr. Richard, I was able to produce, direct, write and voice over 58 documentaries on a number of social and topical issues. We produced documentaries ranging from Evangelizing, Health, Social, and Development issues. Many of our films were based on reproductive health, abortion, HIV/AIDS, tuberculosis, diabetes, farming to name but a few.</p>\n\n<figure><p><img src=\"https://www.nairobileo.co.ke/uploads/posts/IMG-20210908192150.jpeg\"><br></p><figcaption><p><em>Sheila Joy Mulinya</em></p></figcaption></figure>\n\n<p>After an illustrious six years, I left Ukweli as an all-rounded producer at a time when Fr. Richard was going into retirement. I started working on local television shows and had to be adaptable. Coming from a day job into independent practice needed adjusting which had its own rigours but I managed. I worked as a Production coordinator for the then Churchill Live Show with Bob Nyanja at Cinematic Solutions where I had an opportunity to produce a Wedding Show titled Ndoa that aired on NTV. Njanja was different; he was very keen to detail.</p>\n\n<p>My stint at the Churchill show saw me manage the welfare of a team of over 40 crew members. I collected shooting equipment from suppliers, oversaw the whole production process, and delivered equipment to suppliers. This kept me on my toes. I sharpened live recording skills and the demands of producing such a high cluster kind of a show. Churchill was at that time the most-watched TV show in East Africa; a high pressure show to produce but very exciting.</p>\n\n<p>I then joined Tahidi High as a novice Scriptwriter. Working with Producer Catherine Wamuyu whose patience and consistency saw me write for the show for over two years when she had turned me back over six times because my scripts weren\u2019t good enough, was quite an experience. She simply never gave up on me and I soon started writing some of my most memorable scripts. Each episode I wrote was an enthralling experience as I saw stories take shape and get their own life. The network I created at Tahidi High saw me write Inspekta Mwala and Mother-In \u2013Law TV shows too.</p>\n\n<p>Then, it was time to return to school. I went to Moi University for my Bachelor of Science in Communication with a major in Public Relations, then to the University of Nairobi for my Master of Arts in Communication studies, and to Harvard for my Copyright Law Certificate. I am currently writing my proposal for my PhD studies in Mass Communication. Perhaps, I will do another Masters, this time round, in policy.</p>\n\n<p>1.<strong> With your experience in teaching at various institutions of higher learning in Kenya, how would you describe the status of women lecturers in Kenya? \n</strong></p>\n\n<p>What are some of the challenges that women face when climbing up the career ladder within the academic circles and how best can they navigate these challenges?</p>\n\n<p>I have taught at KIMC and St. Paul\u2019s University and currently, I teach Film as a part-time lecturer at USIU-Africa. Mentoring budding filmmakers through my classes that are usually experience-based has presented a great opportunity for me to build my CV, my public speaking skills, and an opportunity to impact and inspire my students.</p>\n\n<p>Women lecturers in Kenya especially in technical film courses are few. I hope that there will be a change in the future. Many countries are eyeing a creative economy and this is a role many women should be a part of. Some of the challenges that women face while climbing the career ladder within academic circles are that they must balance many other responsibilities like motherhood, stereotypes that only men can teach technical courses like camerawork and sound. But this isn\u2019t true.</p>\n\n<figure><p><img src=\"https://www.nairobileo.co.ke/uploads/posts/IMG-20210908191237.jpeg\"><br></p><p><figcaption><em>Sheila Joy Mulinya</em></figcaption></p></figure>\n\n<p>To navigate these challenges, women need to be aggressive, hands on and to look at the bigger picture that includes the balance in opportunities that the film industry presents to all of us. Determination should be the ultimate driver for any woman who is looking to join the academic circle.</p>\n\n<p>2. <strong>You have spent many years of your career doing productions. What are some of the lessons you\u2019ve learnt that can be helpful to those aspiring to join the media industry, especially in production?\n</strong></p>\n\n<p>\uf0fc\tAudience is king. Sometimes the back stories make up for more exciting stories than the main stories that I produce. Ultimately, I am a storyteller and it is something that I keep going back to. Telling stories through TV shows is highly addictive to me and it never seems to go out of fashion in my world. Keeping  your audience entertained or informed is very fulfilling.</p>\n\n<p>\uf0fc\tTeamwork, honesty, patience, consistency get you the success. It is never easy to get a TV show on air as an independent content producer. Respect and listen to everyone on your team they all know something you don't know. TV Production is like a bicycle chain, one bad link and you're stuck. Don\u2019t give up on your vocabulary; sometimes success comes after several attempts.</p>\n\n<p>\uf0fc\tThere will be lots of sacrifices. I have had to get logbook loans from shylocks to shoot pilots and we know how that goes. I have asked my parents for money to sustain some of my shows. I have had to cook breakfast for my cast and crew when I had limited funds to pay for catering services. I have had to multitask, wake up early and sleep very late just to keep some of my shows running. I am grateful to be surrounded by friends who believe in my dreams and support me whenever I call upon them for a new project.</p>\n\n<p>3.<strong> What does the future look like for women in production? Do we have many women behind the camera now compared to when you were starting out? What is your take on leveling the ground? Please share your experience with us.\n</strong></p>\n\n<p>There is hope! Technological advancements and the internet are promising for women in production. Look at all the YouTubers and Vloggers with their cameras that keep churning tones and tones of great content to the masses. Today many newsrooms have female news directors, but this was not the case before. More women are getting behind the camera and creating great content that is competing evenly with that of their male counterparts.</p>\n\n<p>I am proud of all the women who defy stereotypes in storytelling and fly back home with those international nominations and awards. That says that in the coming days, we shall all share in the piece of cake that will come with a vibrant creative economy for TV and Film producers. We are all leaving an indelible mark on the canvas of local television content creation.</p>\n\n<p>In the course of her work, Sheila has received some awards and global recognitions. These include;</p>\n\n<p>\uf0d8\tGhana Students International Film Festival and Israel Film festival.</p>\n\n<p>\uf0d8\tHarvard and Yale; some of her documentaries are research tools on disability in Africa.</p>\n\n<p>\uf0d8\tChicago Film Festival for a short film for kids.</p>\n\n<p>\uf0d8\tDurban best pitch for a Documentary Film that she will be producing soon.</p>\n\n<p>\uf0d8\tMeeting the pope during one of her assignments in Australia.</p>\n\n<p><img src=\"https://www.nairobileo.co.ke/uploads/posts/IMG-20210908192128.jpeg\"><br></p>\n\n<p><em>Sheila Joy Mulinya</em></p>\n\n<p>5.<strong> Given an opportunity to re-imagine the world (for women and girls), is there is anything you would change? \n</strong></p>\n\n<p>Yes. I would change the notion that men are better than women in technical jobs. Given the same level playground, women perform just as well as men. Women are capable and times continue to show us that indeed, yes they are and can be trusted just like men.</p>\n\n<p><strong>6. What role has each of the following aspects played in your career experiences?\n</strong></p>\n\n<p>\u2022\tPursuing your passion. Without distance there is no journey. Had I not followed my passion, I wouldn\u2019t be where I am today. I urge all of us to grasp every opportunity to learn something new with zeal and determination. Attempt to unlearn any habits that deter you from improving yourself. Walk out of completed projects with honour and decorum. Renewed contracts have a propensity to join a link that properly connects to a previous connection that worked successfully.</p>\n\n<p>\u2022\tForging network. The universe is not an island and none of us has it all.  Value your networks as links that will sell your brand and optimize your capabilities. It is in forging great networks that we can have what we do not have. I literally have a fall back plan for whichever need that arises whenever I am engaged in a production thanks to the great networks that I have forged.</p>\n\n<p>\u2022\tTaking risks. Business persons must be able to have a nose for good opportunities and the tendency to cherry pick engagements that will translate into profits. Take risks however always do a risk analysis first. When the deal is too good think twice.</p>\n\n<p>\u2022\tMentorship. For growth to occur, we have to look up to those who have been there before us and transformed what we hope to transform. Walk tall in the shadows of those who inspire you. There is that gratifying element of joy in learning from others.</p>\n\n<p>7.\tIf you were to choose two values that are most important to you that shape the way you work and live, what would they be and why?</p>\n\n<p>I value time keeping, writing and speaking good grammar and hard work. People who keep time and write good grammar will always stick out as neat, professional, and easy to trust. Those impeccable work ethics define and guide me. I don\u2019t stop until the job is done and done well. It is a virtue that earns me referrals for new jobs and connections.</p>\n\n<p><strong>8.\tAny parting shot?\n</strong></p>\n\n<p>It is appalling that in 2021 as a country we are yet to achieve the required 40 per cent quota on local television content within 2 years of opening the channel and 60 per cent soon after. I don\u2019t understand the obsession for foreign content and politics when we haven\u2019t even scratched the surface in telling our own stories.</p>\n\n<p>Politics has its space in shaping the society we live in but a creative economy has a lot to offer particularly to the super talented Kenyans while offering job opportunities to the thousands who are training and graduating to join it.</p>\n\n<p>We have a rich cultural heritage that needs to be shared with the world. We might not as a country provide jobs for everyone but I feel that the local television content production sector would cover a lot of these gaps with focus and finances fully invested into it. Let\u2019s be wise about how well we want to utilise and optimise the talents that God has bestowed unto us.</p>\n\n</article>", "canonicalUrl": "https://www.nairobileo.co.ke/opinions/4273/sheilah-joy-mulinya-film-guru-behind-scripting-of-tahidi-high-other-top-kenyan-series"},{"url": "https://www.nairobileo.co.ke/opinions/4203/relocating-to-kenya-and-conquering-the-broadcast-world-untold-story-of-ugandas-joy-doreen-biira", "probability": 0.9908825, "headline": "Relocating to Kenya and Conquering the Broadcast world; Untold Story of Uganda's Joy Doreen Biira", "datePublished": "2021-09-15T09:34:14.330154", "datePublishedRaw": "3 months ago", "author": "Nairobi Leo", "authorsList": ["Nairobi Leo"], "inLanguage": "en", "breadcrumbs": [{"name": "Home", "link": "https://www.nairobileo.co.ke/"}, {"name": "Opinions", "link": "https://www.nairobileo.co.ke/opinions"}, {"name": "Relocating to Kenya and Conquering the Broadcast world; Untold Story of Uganda's Joy Doreen Biira"}], "mainImage": "https://www.nairobileo.co.ke/uploads/posts/IMG-20210901190255.jpeg", "images": ["https://www.nairobileo.co.ke/uploads/posts/IMG-20210901190255.jpeg", "https://www.nairobileo.co.ke/uploads/posts/IMG-20210901175215.jpeg", "https://www.nairobileo.co.ke/uploads/posts/IMG-20210901175315.jpeg", "https://www.nairobileo.co.ke/uploads/posts/IMG-20210901173621.jpeg", "https://www.nairobileo.co.ke/uploads/posts/IMG-20210901175245.jpeg"], "description": "In our segment of #KenyaWomenSeries, we feature, Joy Doreen Biira.

A media personality, strategic communicator, moderator, speaker, and content curator with over ten years of experience in the media industry (TV, Radio, Electronic, and Digital Media). She is living her dream of telling stories.\n\nBeing a child of two worlds; Kenya and Uganda, she hopes to author a book one day, where she tells her story of growing up in a town in Uganda that was mostly guarded by the military because of its proximity to the Democratic Republic of Congo border.\n\nShe describes herself as every woman \u2013 charismatic, dreamer and doer, lover of simple things in life. A risk-taker, a family-oriented human, mother of the most fabulous boys in town, spouse, mentor, and believer in God. Others describe her as intelligent, professional, and fun at the same time.\n\n1. Please tell us how did your childhood shape you for a career in the media while highlighting some of your major achievements and the events that have shaped it.\n\n\u201cGrowing up, my parents taught my siblings and I to stand up for what we believe in, cherish the value of work, be independent, value integrity, guard our dignity and be as truthful as we could before anything else. You see, no matter how sweet the lie sounds, the truth is mostly regal. And when you think deep, that\u2019s actually what a successful media career is about.\n\nWhile some people go to school to study so as to pursue a career, I was trained into my career. At age 16, during my form 4 vacation, I read my very first news bulletin at Messiah Radio, a local radio station in my hometown: Kasese, Uganda. I was paid under a dollar a day (should that count as a wage?).\n\nBiira adds that most of her high school education was under a merit scholarship by - forum for African women educationalists (FAWE ). She notes that the scholarship came at a time her parents were going through a financial recession.\n\nAs for my TV career began in my 2nd year at Makerere University in Uganda when I was a BSc. Information Technology undergraduate. I was trained on the job on the fundamentals of Journalism shortly before I was cast into the limelight on the country\u2019s premier morning show as co-host and prime-time News Anchor at NBS TV.\n\nNine months after I joined TV, I auditioned for a weekend radio job and got it. At 20, I was one of the \u2018lucky youth\u2019 walking about with two jobs. I did TV Monday to Friday and Radio Saturday and Sunday while still doing school. The knowledge I gained saw me grow into an events moderator and speaker and eventually a strategic Communicator in due time. In addition, I trained Members of parliament on how to leverage technology and the media. After four years on TV and radio, I left Uganda for Kenya.\n\nDuring this transition period, I had two job offers: one at KTN Kenya and Ghana\u2019s TV3. I weighed my options - career growth, proximity to home, cost of living in the two countries, and remuneration. I needed career growth, so I chose Kenya, and that\u2019s the best decision I made.\n\nI started work in the media in Kenya in 2012. My employer and colleagues at the Standard Group were very receptive. I spread my wings from being a Prime-time anchor and reporter to curating, hosting, and co-producing shows such as Africa Speaks, Business Focus, and Business Today. I also hosted Deutsche Welle\u2019s Eco-At-Africa magazine show that was a collaboration between DW & KTN.\n\nThen in 2017, I took a break from full-time broadcast media work. I had been through a near-death experience in 2016 so I made a deliberate decision to take a break for my mental well-being, intending to go back after I felt like myself again. However, months after I did, I was offered a role as Strategic Communications Advisor for an Extractives Facility Project run by DFID and UNDP linked to the new Ministry of Petroleum & Mining. The role allowed me to strengthen my abilities as a strategic communicator.\n\nTogether with the team I worked with at the Ministry, we packaged and branded Kenya\u2019s portfolio globally on its valuable mineral resources. The project ended in 2018.\n\nSince then, I have continued to build my capacity as a strategic communicator at my consultancy Africa Speaks Limited, working with organizations across the globe. We help organizations, individuals and companies strategically communicate at an external level. From media correspondence to content curation, report writing, among others.\n\nI also do media appearances as a contributor for DW Business Africa. I moderate the Kenya edition of EdTech Mondays, a series of Mastercard Foundation\u2019s conversations bringing together EdTech Stakeholders to leverage on education-technology to advance teaching and learning in the country.\n\nIt\u2019s taken a village \u2013 a mix of experienced journalists, media practitioners, mentors and life coaches, a supportive family to get me to where I am today. And I\u2019m ever so grateful to everyone who\u2019s played a part in my career growth. So, I\u2019d say, as you build your career, you\u2019re going to meet so many people \u2013 don\u2019t just pile up your contact list; build a network pool of opportunity.\n\n2. Having worked in different local, regional and international media houses; NBS TV in Uganda, Capital FM Radio in Uganda, KTN News in Kenya and Deutsche Welle. Please tell us about your experience as a woman in media and share lessons on how women can position themselves for opportunities up the ladder in the media industry?\n\n\uf0d8 Attitude is Everything. Understanding that your abilities are not necessarily dependent on your gender is important. It allows the mindset of maturity to work without limits. That is the attitude you need to manage a male-dominated workspace.\n\n\uf0d8 Don\u2019t settle for less. When I started my career in the media, I was the only female among male colleagues on the morning crew of the show we worked on. Then, it was evident that male colleagues did the big interviews. It took persistently proving beyond reasonable doubt that I, too, was capable of doing those same interviews. It took hard work, practice, widening the scope of knowledge and grabbing opportunities. Learn to negotiate.\n\n\uf0d8 Guard your Integrity. There is so much expectation (or lack thereof) on females from both the audience and the media industry itself. The perception of women\u2019s role at all levels is questioned. Did they deserve it? How did they get there? So, guard your focus and integrity. Keep rising with integrity.\n\n\uf0d8 Upgrade your skills. The best thing you can do for your career is to learn something new every so often. Expand your knowledge meter. It is the best gift you can give to your future self. It is the obvious gateway way to better opportunities.\n\n\uf0d8 Focus on the rewards, not the awards. Journalism and the media industry, in general, is about impact. When work is rewarding in terms of fulfilment, it is the beginning of success.\n\n\uf0d8 Never burn bridges. The media is a large yet small space. Today you\u2019re here and tomorrow, the transfer window takes you to another media house. How you navigate your transfers should not be at the cost of your reputation. Always leave a clean slate.\n\n3. How have the following impacted your career life?\n\n\u2022 Personal Branding: The world perceives us by how we introduce ourselves; the reputation we leave behind, and the inspiration we exude before entering a room. Meet and exceed those expectations when you step in or out of a room. Show up as a better version of who the world expects you to be. I\u2019m still getting better at it as I advance in my career.\n\n\u2022 Forging networks: Networks are the best way to build social capital. Be unashamed to say you don\u2019t know how to network and open enough to learn and capitalize on your networks. Some of my best work ideas have come from listening to the most unusual stories in networking spaces. Having transitioned from media to Communication consultancy, I have learnt that one has to have a great pool of networks, social capital, dynamism and the right expertise.\n\n\u2022 Taking up new challenges: I\u2019ve never been the kind to shy away from new challenges. I take them on afraid (very afraid, I might add) and with an open mind. We are unaware of many of our abilities because of the fear of the unknown, and it isn\u2019t until we are uprooted and planted elsewhere that we are forced to adjust. So bloom where you\u2019re planted. Pack a bag, move to another town, city, country \u2013 start over, whatever it is, just do it. Your best achievements are stuck between you and being stuck in the same race.\n\n\u2022 Mentorship. I\u2019m honoured to have been mentored by people who have changed my mindset, reorganized my thoughts and raised confidence in my abilities.\n\n4. Given an opportunity to re-imagine the world, is there is anything you would change? If yes, what will it be and why?\n\nThe world is perfect as it is with imperfect humans in it. That said, I wish the creativity of young Africans would be harnessed better. Having practised as a broadcast business media personality for years, I would change how we treat our ageing population and our young population, which I consider the demographic dividend. It almost feels like African governments don\u2019t quite know what to do with young people. Governments are caught between not knowing what to do with retirees at age 60 and above and young people below 35.\n\n5. If you were to choose the two most important values that you live by and that keep you grounded and shape the way you work and live, what would they be and why?\n\n\uf0fc Integrity. For my present self, my future self, and me in the future past. That when I\u2019m old and grey, above and beyond all achievements, that I am & was a human of integrity before God and to humanity.\n\n\uf0fc Attitude. Attitude is altitude; it is a house of cards. I\u2019m only ever going to be what I set my attitude to be. So I choose to stay positive most days.\n\nAny parting shot?\n\nTo fellow young career women; normalize taking career breaks to re-energize and even take care of your young family. Part of the reason I took fewer work hours was to spend more time with my very young family. Work has diversified; we can now do work online with flexible hours. We can study online while working and spend time with family. It\u2019s not the hours you spend in the workspace. It\u2019s more about the value and merit you bring to the table.\n\nAlso, Vehicles have engines, trees have roots, and human beings have dual power\u2013the mind and the heart. So may we learn to ignite our hearts to be full of the joys of life and our minds to go after what we are passionate about; this is the key to being.", "articleBodyHtml": "<article>\n\n<p>In our segment of #KenyaWomenSeries, we feature, Joy Doreen Biira.

So, I\u2019d say, as you build your career, you\u2019re going to meet so many people \u2013 don\u2019t just pile up your contact list; build a network pool of opportunity.</p>\n\n<p>2. <strong>Having worked in different local, regional and international media houses; NBS TV in Uganda, Capital FM Radio in Uganda, KTN News in Kenya and Deutsche Welle. Please tell us about your experience as a woman in media and share lessons on how women can position themselves for opportunities up the ladder in the media industry?\n</strong></p>\n\n<p>\uf0d8\tAttitude is Everything. Understanding that your abilities are not necessarily dependent on your gender is important. It allows the mindset of maturity to work without limits. That is the attitude you need to manage a male-dominated workspace.</p>\n\n<p>\uf0d8\tDon\u2019t settle for less. When I started my career in the media, I was the only female among male colleagues on the morning crew of the show we worked on. Then, it was evident that male colleagues did the big interviews. It took persistently proving beyond reasonable doubt that I, too, was capable of doing those same interviews. It took hard work, practice, widening the scope of knowledge and grabbing opportunities. Learn to negotiate.</p>\n\n<p>\uf0d8\t Guard your Integrity. There is so much expectation (or lack thereof) on females from both the audience and the media industry itself. The perception of women\u2019s role at all levels is questioned. Did they deserve it? How did they get there? So, guard your focus and integrity. Keep rising with integrity.</p>\n\n<p>\uf0d8\tUpgrade your skills. The best thing you can do for your career is to learn something new every so often. Expand your knowledge meter. It is the best gift you can give to your future self. It is the obvious gateway way to better opportunities.</p>\n\n<p>\uf0d8\t Focus on the rewards, not the awards. Journalism and the media industry, in general, is about impact. When work is rewarding in terms of fulfilment, it is the beginning of success.</p>\n\n<p>\uf0d8\t Never burn bridges. The media is a large yet small space. Today you\u2019re here and tomorrow, the transfer window takes you to another media house. How you navigate your transfers should not be at the cost of your reputation. Always leave a clean slate.</p>\n\n<p><img src=\"https://www.nairobileo.co.ke/uploads/posts/IMG-20210901175245.jpeg\"><br></p>\n\n<p>3. <strong>How have the following impacted your career life?\n</strong></p>\n\n<p>\u2022\tPersonal Branding: The world perceives us by how we introduce ourselves; the reputation we leave behind, and the inspiration we exude before entering a room. Meet and exceed those expectations when you step in or out of a room. Show up as a better version of who the world expects you to be. I\u2019m still getting better at it as I advance in my career.</p>\n\n<p>\u2022\tForging networks: Networks are the best way to build social capital. Be unashamed to say you don\u2019t know how to network and open enough to learn and capitalize on your networks. Some of my best work ideas have come from listening to the most unusual stories in networking spaces. Having transitioned from media to Communication consultancy, I have learnt that one has to have a great pool of networks, social capital, dynamism and the right expertise.</p>\n\n<p>\u2022\tTaking up new challenges: I\u2019ve never been the kind to shy away from new challenges. I take them on afraid (very afraid, I might add) and with an open mind. We are unaware of many of our abilities because of the fear of the unknown, and it isn\u2019t until we are uprooted and planted elsewhere that we are forced to adjust. So bloom where you\u2019re planted. Pack a bag, move to another town, city, country \u2013 start over, whatever it is, just do it. Your best achievements are stuck between you and being stuck in the same race.</p>\n\n<p>\u2022\tMentorship. I\u2019m honoured to have been mentored by people who have changed my mindset, reorganized my thoughts and raised confidence in my abilities.</p>\n\n<p>4. <strong>Given an opportunity to re-imagine the world, is there is anything you would change? If yes, what will it be and why? \n</strong></p>\n\n<p>The world is perfect as it is with imperfect humans in it. That said, I wish the creativity of young Africans would be harnessed better. Having practised as a broadcast business media personality for years, I would change how we treat our ageing population and our young population, which I consider the demographic dividend. It almost feels like African governments don\u2019t quite know what to do with young people. Governments are caught between not knowing what to do with retirees at age 60 and above and young people below 35.</p>\n\n<p>5. If you were to choose the two most important values that you live by and that keep you grounded and shape the way you work and live, what would they be and why?</p>\n\n<p>\uf0fc\tIntegrity. For my present self, my future self, and me in the future past. That when I\u2019m old and grey, above and beyond all achievements, that I am &amp; was a human of integrity before God and to humanity.</p>\n\n<p>\uf0fc\tAttitude. Attitude is altitude; it is a house of cards. I\u2019m only ever going to be what I set my attitude to be. So I choose to stay positive most days.</p>\n\n<p><img src=\"https://www.nairobileo.co.ke/uploads/posts/IMG-20210901175315.jpeg\"><br></p>\n\n<p><strong>Any parting shot?\n</strong></p>\n\n<p>To fellow young career women; normalize taking career breaks to re-energize and even take care of your young family. Part of the reason I took fewer work hours was to spend more time with my very young family. Work has diversified; we can now do work online with flexible hours. We can study online while working and spend time with family. It\u2019s not the hours you spend in the workspace. It\u2019s more about the value and merit you bring to the table.</p>\n\n<p>Also, Vehicles have engines, trees have roots, and human beings have dual power\u2013the mind and the heart. So may we learn to ignite our hearts to be full of the joys of life and our minds to go after what we are passionate about; this is the key to being.</p>\n\n</article>", "canonicalUrl": "https://www.nairobileo.co.ke/opinions/4203/relocating-to-kenya-and-conquering-the-broadcast-world-untold-story-of-ugandas-joy-doreen-biira"},{"url": "https://www.nairobileo.co.ke/opinions/4431/grace-njiru-founder-of-chesed-healthcare-providing-quality-home-based-care", "probability": 0.98941296, "headline": "Grace Njiru: Founder of Chesed Healthcare Providing Quality Home-based Care", "datePublished": "2021-10-15T09:34:14.758444", "datePublishedRaw": "2 months ago", "author": "Nairobi Leo", "authorsList": ["Nairobi Leo"], "inLanguage": "en", "breadcrumbs": [{"name": "Home", "link": "https://www.nairobileo.co.ke/"}, {"name": "Opinions", "link": "https://www.nairobileo.co.ke/opinions"}, {"name": "Grace Njiru: Founder of Chesed Healthcare Providing Quality Home-based Care"}], "mainImage": "https://www.nairobileo.co.ke/uploads/posts/IMG-20210922211553.JPG", "images": ["https://www.nairobileo.co.ke/uploads/posts/IMG-20210922211553.JPG", "https://www.nairobileo.co.ke/uploads/posts/IMG-20210922211712.jpeg", "https://www.nairobileo.co.ke/uploads/posts/IMG-20210922212029.jpeg", "https://www.nairobileo.co.ke/uploads/posts/IMG-20210922212709.jpeg", "https://www.nairobileo.co.ke/uploads/posts/IMG-20210922212648.jpeg"], "description": "In our segment of #KenyaWomenSeries, we feature, Grace Njiru.

As a young girl, Grace always wanted to be a nurse. Her caring persona finally aligned with her profession. Grace has over 16 years of experience ranging from the clinical setting, teaching, research, and management.\n\nShe is also a mother of one and describes herself as strong-willed and a go-getter who stops at nothing to get what she desires.\n\nAfter her education journey, she transited to a mission institution for humanitarian work with a faith-based organization and later with an international Non- Governmental Organization. \u201cServing the vulnerable populations in South Sudan was quite a fulfilling and rewarding journey at a personal and professional level.\u201d She said.\n\nAt some point in her career, she took a deliberate rest from formal employment to think about the direction that God wanted for her. She prayerfully looked at the gaps in the healthcare system in Kenya. She then noticed that chronic care was unexploited.\n\nToday, Grace is the founder at Chesed Home Healthcare, a nursing agency committed to providing quality home-based care for clients from all walks of life.\n\nI was keen to study nursing, and so upon completion of high school, I enrolled for a Diploma in nursing at the Kenya Medical Training College \u2013 Nyeri campus. My career in nursing began at the Nazareth Hospital, where I took up tutorial roles at the Nazareth Medical College for four years.\n\nThen, I transited to the mission institution for humanitarian work with a faith-based organization and later with an International Non- Governmental Organization. Serving the vulnerable populations in South Sudan was a pretty fulfilling and rewarding journey at a personal and professional level.\n\nDuring this period, one of my greatest joys was leading different actors in the pilot study of the field guide for Newborn Care in the Humanitarian setting; a tool that will be used globally to reduce neonatal morbidity and mortality.\n\nI never saw myself going into private practice at any point in my career. It was not until I took a deliberate rest from formal employment to seek God\u2019s direction into my future. Prayerfully, I looked at gaps in the healthcare system in Kenya. I noticed that chronic care was unexploited. I had also helped to care for relatives and friends who had different illnesses at different times.\n\nThis led to the birth of Chesed Home Healthcare, a nursing agency committed to providing quality home-based care for clients from all walks of life.\n\nHowever, what stirred me was the experience my grandparents went through in their last days. Although our families gave the best they could, I felt the need to do more for persons with long-term illnesses to enjoy optimal health and comfort.\n\nAt Chesed Home Healthcare, we offer a wide range of services including;\n\n\uf076 Basic daily living activities- these are chores that one cannot do independently in the presence of illness e.g bathing, grooming, feeding etc.\n\n\uf076 Wound care and management.\n\n\uf076 Palliative and hospice care.\n\n\uf076 Nutritional support.\n\n\uf076 Elimination support- Catheter care and colostomy care.\n\nI wish more people understood that home health services have many benefits to all those involved, including the hospitals and families. For example, hospitals would make better use of the extra bed occupancy to care for acute conditions rather than have patients who are at risk of getting infections due to prolonged hospital stays.\n\nOn the other hand, families get to go about their business while we care for their loved ones cost-effectively. Patients, too, get a chance to recuperate in a familiar environment.\n\nBoth the hospital and the home health agencies have an integral role in healthcare. We can only leverage the strengths of each part. At Chesed, compassion sets us apart. We want to walk the journey; go the extra mile to ensure the family feels they can count on us.\n\n1. Please talk to us about some of the client\u2019s challenges you\u2019ve encountered along the way and how have you managed to solve the same?\n\nWe have faced two main challenges: Most of our clients are not aware of the existence of structured home healthcare services in Kenya, and those who know, assume that it is costly. We are therefore seizing any opportunity to create awareness and sensitize the public on different modalities of care.\n\nThe other challenge we encounter is family dynamics, whereby some families do not value end-of-life care when caring for the elderly. While the dying deserves respectful and dignified transitions, some feel there is no need of spending resources on them. We try and encourage families to have open discussions about death and care of the dying. In addition to that, saving up for the dependency phase for the elderly can help ease the burden of care.\n\n2. Home healthcare venture is seen as a new concept in Kenya. What does the future look like?\n\nBeing a new venture means that, as the baby boomer population ages, there is an increased demand for home healthcare services. People are likely to embrace homes for the elderly where collective care can be provided cost-effectively. We see several agencies coming up in the major towns; this is quite encouraging. It means that there is a need, and we are here to serve and meet the need with lots of compassion.\n\nTo realize our mission and vision, we would like to partner with hospitals that are keen to see the continuity of quality care for chronic cases. Most families are just asked to look for a caregiver, yet they don\u2019t know where to start from. Additionally, we would like to partner with people and organizations who would like to help deserving cases with equipment or in-kind since we get the cases and we are not able to address all their issues.\n\n3. What are some of the lessons you\u2019ve learnt that can be helpful to those aspiring to join this kind of venture, especially for those outside major cities like Nairobi?\n\nFor the visionary who would like to venture into the sector, I would encourage them to start small with what they have as they progressively grow their businesses. In addition, partnerships with other health players would be variable. However, they need to remain alive to unregulated practice as this is also a common phenomenon that can lead to endangering lives. It is within our moral obligation to protect the practice.\n\n4. Tell us what role has each of the following aspects played in your career life-giving brief real-life experiences?\n\n\u2022 Pursuing your passion. \u201cThe crowning of a man is to be born to some pursuit which finds him employment and happiness, whether it is through making baskets, or broadswords or canals or statues, or songs,\u201d Ralph Waldo Emerson. So it pays off to align ourselves with what we can do effortlessly, or better still, what we are born to do. I am glad I have followed my passion. By serving others, I have found lots of fulfilment in life.\n\n\u2022 Forging networks. Peter Gale once said that our net worth is the value of our network. It takes time and resources to invest in networks, and if done correctly, the benefits can outlive us.\n\n\u2022 Taking risks. I describe myself as a moderate risk taker, but the many times I have taken a risk, right there, I have found turning points in my life that would otherwise never have materialized. Here is the question I always ask myself: What is the worst if I take the risk? Often after asking this question, I am ready to take the jump.\n\n\u2022 Mentorship. All business or life\u2019s journey requires mentorship. Whether at a personal level or corporate, there is the need to have people who have walked the journey ahead, to guide us.\n\n5. If you were to choose one value that is most important to you that shape the way you work and run Chesed Home Healthcare, what will they be and why?\n\n\u2022 Integrity is a value I hold close in all that I do, and this is not any different in my business. I deal with human life, and I cannot compromise the standards of care for anything. It is something I try to instill in my staff and all those that I come into contact with.\n\n\u2022 Compassion and Empathy- I have learnt the art of wearing other people\u2019s shoes to understand their pain points. I am passionate about caring for individuals, families, and communities so that they can attain, maintain and recover optimal health and quality care.

A media practitioner who has made a mark in the media industry, having worked at it for about 20 years.

Be very clear about this. Media sets the agenda for what Kenyans are discussing and thinking about.

I have learned to leap for the things I want and learn what it will take to deliver in that new role. This has grown my confidence and allowed me to reach for more things. I am clear that I am a quick learner and a hard worker.\n\n\uf076 Networking. Many people think of networking as meeting people, but actually it is giving. The best way to go about it is to build relationships by giving of your ideas, your networks, and your time. Be generous and add value it always pays off.\n\n\uf076 Work-life balance. This one is a myth! About 2 weeks in a year I get it right with work-life balance; spend time with God, my family, put in 100% at work, work out, have alone time. But if I am being honest the rest of the year I\u2019m frequently re-evaluating my priorities.\n\nThe COVID-19 pandemic showed us all how little control we have and how our daily activities do not necessarily align with what brings us joy and fulfillment. I have since adjusted my life to include more time with God, family time, personal time, exercise etc\n\n\uf076 Mentorship.

", "articleBody": "In our segment of #KenyaWomenSeries, we feature, Rachel Ombaka. A journalist and online Sub-editor, with 12 years in media and who Is articulate and meticulous when it comes to detail. She describes herself as a woman's woman; she stands in the gap and uses her voice to amplify the achievements of outstanding women as well as the challenges they face. She is audacious, unapologetic, and always willing to go the extra mile.\n\nOmbaka's career began in the media industry despite training in Information Systems & Technology. She interned as an online sub-editor at Nation Media Group (NMG) in 2007 before joining Citizen TV later on in 2018.\n\nBut how did she gain entry into media? We asked her.\n\n\" I was in my final year at USIU-Africa when Nation Media Group launched its first Media Lab program. Soon after they began seeking qualified applicants and I gave it a shot. I was among the six Kenyans who were selected for training alongside other students from Uganda and Tanzania. It is there that I honed my journalistic skills.\n\nWorking at NMG prepares you to work anywhere else in the world and it is because of this experience that I got to work at Citizen TV and currently at Jeune Afrique Media Group, with the Africa Report team. At Citizen TV, I worked under Philip Mwaniki (head of digital) and he was very instrumental in my career growth. He challenged me:\n\n\uf0fc To take charge of the digital reporters and social media.\n\uf0fc To take up opportunities for training such as the Women in News leadership program.\n\uf0fc To speak at conferences and speak up against challenges that emerge when working in a newsroom setup.\nDoing so opened numerous doors and set the trajectory of my career on an upward trend.\n\n1. You are very passionate and vocal about issues affecting female journalists and have spoken at many conferences about sexual harassment in newsrooms. Tell us more about this as you share your experiences as a female journalist who has suffered from sexual harassment.\n\nI have spoken at several conferences: the African Women in Media conference (AWiM 2019); the commemoration of the International Day to End Impunity and Crimes against Journalists (IDEI 2020) and the World Press Freedom Day 2021 conference that was organized by the Media Council of Kenya (MCK).\n\nMost recently, during the Digital Media Africa 2021 conference, I was in a panel with editors from Malawi, Rwanda, and Zimbabwe where a report was released showing that women don't tell anyone when they are sexually harassed in the newsroom because of a fear of retaliation and lack of faith that their organisations will do anything about it. Additionally, two out of five times, the perpetrator is a person in authority.\n\nSexual harassment is about power and patriarchy provides an enabling environment for this behaviour to thrive. Most Kenyan newsrooms are male-dominated, so you find that when it is a woman speaking up against this vice, they see the women and don't hear the message, and society is conditioned to listen more to men than to women.\n\nThere has also been a debate on how one can label a romantic approach as sexual harassment yet it could be a genuine pursuit. I also kept being asked why women take small issues so seriously and how are men supposed to get wives if we start restraining them.\n\nGetting perpetrators to understand that sexual harassment is based on how the person on the receiving end feels about the behaviour remains a big challenge. We have to continue speaking about it to help people understand that one cannot be comfortable or thrive in the workplace if they constantly feel violated.\n\n2. How did you find your voice in speaking about it and why is it important that we address sexual harassment in media?\n\nIt was through the Women in News (WiN) Leadership Accelerator programme where sexual harassment was one of the training modules. Regular engagements with Jane Godia, who is now the director for Africa; MCK's Christine Nguku, who was my coach at the time; Mildred Ngesa, a leadership coach; and female journalists who went through the WiN program before me is what dropped the scales from my eyes, so to speak.\n\nSexual harassment is misunderstood as a fight between men and women, yet it is very personal and centred on wielding power over those seen to be at a lower level.\n\nViolating someone takes all forms, just to mention a few:\n\n\u2022 Lewd messages on texts or social media\n\n\u2022 Catcalling\n\n\u2022 Sexist jokes\n\n\u2022 Inappropriate touching/hugging\n\n\u2022 Comments about intimate parts of the body\n\nThe list is endless.\n\nIt has led to people leaving their jobs or writing off the media industry as a whole, poor performance in the workplace, mental anguish, lowered self-esteem and the media industry's image gets tainted.\n\nWith corporates now analysing sexual harassment and gender equity, we will start seeing advertisers pulling out or declining to be linked with media organisations that are perceived to be perpetuating the vice. Sexual harassment is bad for business and nipping it in the bud isn't just valuable for employees, but also necessary for maintaining relationships with organisations that partner with the media.\n\n3. You are part of the team working with the Kenya Media Sector Working Group to deal with sexual harassment in newsrooms (MCK, AMWIK, Article 19, JHR, Women in News and The Woman's Newsroom Foundation). Tell us about your experience working on this project and some of the impact you envision will be a result of this.\n\nWe have had several meetings to assess what the situation on the ground is, what each organization is doing to combat sexual harassment, what is hampering victims from reporting and where we can come in to strengthen willing organizations as well as existing policies.\n\nWhat we have realized is that most organizations have sexual harassment policies to tick boxes but they are not implementing them. Additionally, there are no clear reporting structures, neither is their support for those who report such cases.\n\nTherefore, we are identifying legal channels that can help in this area and setting up structures that will offer guidance on reporting mechanisms. We will also be working with universities to train students on sexual harassment so that when they join media organizations as interns, they know how to identify the vice, report and ward off perpetrators.\n\nb) Will you share some practical tips that journalists can apply if they encounter sexual harassment in the newsroom?\n\nWhat has worked for me is the Women in News practical guide for employers and employees.\n\nFor an employee, there are six steps that one can choose to address:\n\nI. Identify how you are being sexually harassed.\n\nII. If you feel able to, inform your harasser that the behaviour is unwanted.\n\nIII. Keep yourself safe at work.\n\nIV. Keep and gather evidence.\n\nV. Make a complaint; and\n\nVI. Seek support.\n\nFor employers, the guide has eight key points:\n\nI. Treat all complaints seriously.\n\nII. Have both informal and formal complaints procedures.\n\nIII. Enable anonymous disclosures.\n\nIV. Appoint a designated person to deal with and investigate cases of sexual harassment.\n\nV. Bring in assistance or expertise - in some situations where it may be necessary - to ensure a fair, impartial and objective investigation.\n\nVI. Report sexual assault to the police if the case involves sexual assault (including rape)\n\nVII. Consider the option of suspension, in more serious cases such as sexual assault, as the organization (or the police) complete investigation; and\n\nVIII. Explain your procedure in your policy to employees as well as managers so that there is no confusion about what is involved.\n\n4. With such tremendous growth in her career, we asked Rachel how what role the following have played in her career.\n\nMentorship. It sounds like such a complicated word but it's not. I sought out women in my career who were where I wanted to be and who were doing what I aspired to do.\n\nSome of them don't even know that I look up to them. I either interact with them on social media or ask them out for coffee or lunch, once in a blue moon. Intentional conversation \u2013 online or offline \u2013 is powerful. I get to see my life through someone else's eyes and then make changes where need be.\n\nPersonal Branding. I could write a whole book about personal branding. Aside from speaking up against social harassment, I have been asked to speak about social media and mental health by the Chiromo Hospital Group, gender-based violence by Amnesty International Kenya and I have done several projects with Oxfam Kenya.\n\nIf you look at my timelines on social media, you will notice that I use social media as a tool: to pass on a message, support a cause, connect with like-minded individuals, offer support and get encouragement.\n\nI have learnt that people, including potential employers, may not engage with you on a day-to-day basis, but when they need someone to work with, your brand is what will set you apart from the rest. And people can only know your brand if you constantly speak about it, authentically.\n\nTaking up new challenges. I rarely shy away from new opportunities or tough conversations even when they seem scary, and somehow they have always paid off. Even when I am afraid, I still take the leap.\n\nLife can get overwhelming if we only stick to what we know, and one can never know if we can be good at something if we don't try. Wondering 'what if' is not my cup of tea: I would rather look back and say, at least I tried.\n\nForging networks. I have met and worked with people who I never thought would cross my path. I did this by joining organisations such as AMWIK and Amnesty International Kenya; plugging into online conversations such as the hosted by VOA's Kennedy Wandera on Twitter Spaces, signing up for a Thomson Reuters Foundation health reporting training and reaching out to people whose work I want to amplify. Doing this has given me several opportunities to learn, unlearn, get interviewees and showcase my work.\n\n5. Given an opportunity to re-imagine the world (for women and girls), is there is anything you would change? If yes, what will it be and why?\n\nYes. Not everyone has the opportunity or the ability to speak up for themselves when aggrieved, which is why we cannot always assume that we are all the same. We are all going through life at a different pace and everyone's journey is different. I would change the fact that we often have to speak up or fight for our rights, based on our identity. We need a world where everyone is respected and valued irrespective of who they are.\n\n6. If you were to choose two values that are most important to you that shape the way you work and live, what would they be and why?\n\n\uf076 Authenticity: When you are true to who you are, living life genuinely, not comparing yourself or focusing on others' perception of you, somehow the wind will always rise beneath your wings.\n\n\uf076 Being intentional about physical and mental health, how you engage with friends and family and what you post on social media. You do yourself a disservice when you just go through the motions, without thinking of the bigger picture. Be the energy you want to attract.\n\n7.

Regular engagements with Jane Godia, who is now the director for Africa; MCK's Christine Nguku, who was my coach at the time; Mildred Ngesa, a leadership coach; and female journalists who went through the WiN program before me is what dropped the scales from my eyes, so to speak.</p>\n\n<p>Sexual harassment is misunderstood as a fight between men and women, yet it is very personal and centred on wielding power over those seen to be at a lower level.</p>\n\n<p>Violating someone takes all forms, just to mention a few:</p>\n\n<p>\u2022\tLewd messages on texts or social media</p>\n\n<p>\u2022\tCatcalling</p>\n\n<p>\u2022\tSexist jokes</p>\n\n<p>\u2022\tInappropriate touching/hugging</p>\n\n<p>\u2022\tComments about intimate parts of the body</p>\n\n<p>The list is endless.</p>\n\n<p>It has led to people leaving their jobs or writing off the media industry as a whole, poor performance in the workplace, mental anguish, lowered self-esteem and the media industry's image gets tainted.</p>\n\n<p>With corporates now analysing sexual harassment and gender equity, we will start seeing advertisers pulling out or declining to be linked with media organisations that are perceived to be perpetuating the vice. Sexual harassment is bad for business and nipping it in the bud isn't just valuable for employees, but also necessary for maintaining relationships with organisations that partner with the media.</p>\n\n<p>3.\t<strong>You are part of the team working with the Kenya Media Sector Working Group to deal with sexual harassment in newsrooms (MCK, AMWIK, Article 19, JHR, Women in News and The Woman's Newsroom Foundation). Tell us about your experience working on this project and some of the impact you envision will be a result of this.\n</strong></p>\n\n<p>We have had several meetings to assess what the situation on the ground is, what each organization is doing to combat sexual harassment, what is hampering victims from reporting and where we can come in to strengthen willing organizations as well as existing policies.</p>\n\n<p>What we have realized is that most organizations have sexual harassment policies to tick boxes but they are not implementing them. Additionally, there are no clear reporting structures, neither is their support for those who report such cases.</p>\n\n<p>Therefore, we are identifying legal channels that can help in this area and setting up structures that will offer guidance on reporting mechanisms. We will also be working with universities to train students on sexual harassment so that when they join media organizations as interns, they know how to identify the vice, report and ward off perpetrators.</p>\n\n<p><img src=\"https://www.nairobileo.co.ke/uploads/posts/IMG-20210728212404.jpeg\"><br></p>\n\n<p>b) <strong>Will you share some practical tips that journalists can apply if they encounter sexual harassment in the newsroom?\n</strong></p>\n\n<p>What has worked for me is the Women in News practical guide for employers and employees.</p>\n\n<p>For an employee, there are six steps that one can choose to address:</p>\n\n<p>I.\tIdentify how you are being sexually harassed.</p>\n\n<p>II.\tIf you feel able to, inform your harasser that the behaviour is unwanted.</p>\n\n<p>III.\tKeep yourself safe at work.</p>\n\n<p>IV.\tKeep and gather evidence.</p>\n\n<p>V.\tMake a complaint; and</p>\n\n<p>VI.\tSeek support.</p>\n\n<p>For employers, the guide has eight key points:</p>\n\n<p>I.\tTreat all complaints seriously.</p>\n\n<p>II.\tHave both informal and formal complaints procedures.</p>\n\n<p>III.\tEnable anonymous disclosures.</p>\n\n<p>IV.\tAppoint a designated person to deal with and investigate cases of sexual harassment.</p>\n\n<p>V.\tBring in assistance or expertise - in some situations where it may be necessary - to ensure a fair, impartial and objective investigation.</p>\n\n<p>VI.\tReport sexual assault to the police if the case involves sexual assault (including rape)</p>\n\n<p>VII.\tConsider the option of suspension, in more serious cases such as sexual assault, as the organization (or the police) complete investigation;  and</p>\n\n<p>VIII.\tExplain your procedure in your policy to employees as well as managers so that there is no confusion about what is involved.</p>\n\n<p>4.\t<strong>With such tremendous growth in her career, we asked Rachel how what role the following have played in her career.\n</strong></p>\n\n<p>Mentorship. It sounds like such a complicated word but it's not. I sought out women in my career who were where I wanted to be and who were doing what I aspired to do.</p>\n\n<p>Some of them don't even know that I look up to them. I either interact with them on social media or ask them out for coffee or lunch, once in a blue moon. Intentional conversation \u2013 online or offline \u2013 is powerful. I get to see my life through someone else's eyes and then make changes where need be.</p>\n\n<p>Personal Branding. I could write a whole book about personal branding. Aside from speaking up against social harassment, I have been asked to speak about social media and mental health by the Chiromo Hospital Group, gender-based violence by Amnesty International Kenya and I have done several projects with Oxfam Kenya.<br></p>\n\n<p>If you look at my timelines on social media, you will notice that I use social media as a tool: to pass on a message, support a cause, connect with like-minded individuals, offer support and get encouragement.</p>\n\n<p>I have learnt that people, including potential employers, may not engage with you on a day-to-day basis, but when they need someone to work with, your brand is what will set you apart from the rest. And people can only know your brand if you constantly speak about it, authentically.</p>\n\n<p>Taking up new challenges. I rarely shy away from new opportunities or tough conversations even when they seem scary, and somehow they have always paid off. Even when I am afraid, I still take the leap.</p>\n\n<p>Life can get overwhelming if we only stick to what we know, and one can never know if we can be good at something if we don't try. Wondering 'what if' is not my cup of tea: I would rather look back and say, at least I tried.</p>\n\n<p>Forging networks. I have met and worked with people who I never thought would cross my path. I did this by joining organisations such as AMWIK and Amnesty International Kenya; plugging into online conversations such as the hosted by VOA's Kennedy Wandera on Twitter Spaces, signing up for a Thomson Reuters Foundation health reporting training and reaching out to people whose work I want to amplify. Doing this has given me several opportunities to learn, unlearn, get interviewees and showcase my work.</p>\n\n<p><br><img src=\"https://www.nairobileo.co.ke/uploads/posts/IMG-20210728212016.jpeg\"></p>\n\n<p>5. <strong>Given an opportunity to re-imagine the world (for women and girls), is there is anything you would change? If yes, what will it be and why? \n</strong></p>\n\n<p>Yes. Not everyone has the opportunity or the ability to speak up for themselves when aggrieved, which is why we cannot always assume that we are all the same. We are all going through life at a different pace and everyone's journey is different. I would change the fact that we often have to speak up or fight for our rights, based on our identity. We need a world where everyone is respected and valued irrespective of who they are.</p>\n\n<p>6. <strong>If you were to choose two values that are most important to you that shape the way you work and live, what would they be and why?\n</strong></p>\n\n<p>\uf076\tAuthenticity: When you are true to who you are, living life genuinely, not comparing yourself or focusing on others' perception of you, somehow the wind will always rise beneath your wings.</p>\n\n<p>\uf076\tBeing intentional about physical and mental health, how you engage with friends and family and what you post on social media. You do yourself a disservice when you just go through the motions, without thinking of the bigger picture. Be the energy you want to attract.</p>\n\n<p>7. <strong>Any parting shot? \n</strong></p>\n\n</article>", "canonicalUrl": "https://www.nairobileo.co.ke/opinions/3801/rachael-ombaka-journalist-leading-fight-against-sexual-harassment-in-kenyan-newsrooms"},{"url": "https://www.nairobileo.co.ke/opinions/3888/how-judie-kaberia-moved-from-intern-at-radio-waumini-to-executive-director-at-amwik", "probability": 0.9946361, "headline": "How Judie Kaberia Moved from Intern at Radio Waumini to Executive Director at AMWIK", "datePublished": "2021-08-15T09:34:29.914586", "datePublishedRaw": "4 months ago", "author": "Nairobi Leo", "authorsList": ["Nairobi Leo"], "inLanguage": "en", "breadcrumbs": [{"name": "Home", "link": "https://www.nairobileo.co.ke/"}, {"name": "Opinions", "link": "https://www.nairobileo.co.ke/opinions"}, {"name": "How Judie Kaberia Moved from Intern at Radio Waumini to Executive Director at AMWIK"}], "mainImage": "https://www.nairobileo.co.ke/uploads/posts/IMG-20210804223842.JPG", "images": ["https://www.nairobileo.co.ke/uploads/posts/IMG-20210804223842.JPG", "https://www.nairobileo.co.ke/uploads/posts/IMG-20210804221020.jpeg", "https://www.nairobileo.co.ke/uploads/posts/IMG-20210804220933.jpeg", "https://www.nairobileo.co.ke/uploads/posts/IMG-20210804221047.jpeg", "https://www.nairobileo.co.ke/uploads/posts/IMG-20210804221120.jpeg"], "description": "In our segment of #KenyaWomenSeries, we feature, Judie Kaberia.

Kaberia has eleven awards to her name as a multimedia journalist, she is an accomplished media trainer and mentor, with over 15 years of experience in journalism.\n\nRecently, she was appointed Executive Director of the Association of Media Women in Media (AMWIK). Judie Kaberia\u2019s career in the media began at Radio Waumini as a reporter, producer, and later as an editor.\n\n\u201cI was a rookie when I joined Radio Waumini, which provided me with the platform to make all the mistakes and learn from them. With my heavy Kimeru accent, I could hardly pronounce Bs and Ds without inserting M or N before words. To me books were mbooks,\" she says.\n\nStill, I wanted to be a broadcast journalist. I got advice to concentrate on print but I hang on to my dream to speak on radio or TV. A friend encouraged me to work on my accent by writing many words with Bs and Ds, and short sentences, practice reading them aloud for hours, record and listen. I spent lots of time working on this and improving.\n\nIn 2004, I left Radio Waumini for Germany and interned at Hellweg Radio in Soest in North-Rhine Westphalia. By this time I had sharpened speaking in German and could comfortably communicate.\n\nTwo years later I returned to Kenya and joined Capital FM; yet another opportunity for me to hone my skills in journalism. Chris Kirubi, may his soul rest in peace, was a man with a vision and alert to technological advancements.\n\nHe was talking about convergence in 2006 as the future of media and encouraged me to try a hand at print and television. I did and became an excellent multimedia journalist.\n\nThen I got into feature writing and investigative reporting and maximized on impact and solution-oriented journalism. I discovered the power I have as a journalist; through stories, I could influence policies, spur public debates on important issues and bring impact such as the establishment of health centres for women to deliver their babies in hospitals, availability of family planning methods, and many others.\n\nYet another defining moment in my career was the Kenyan cases at the International Criminal Court (ICC). I learnt about specialized journalism which introduced me to international criminal law. This expanded my knowledge and skills in reporting on international crimes, international and regional judicial systems.\n\nBefore the Kenyan cases started at the ICC, I met two excellent friends, whom I look up to. Bettina Ambach, a former German journalist and now Wayamo Foundation\u2019s director and Roberts Mensah \u2013 formerly Chief of Un Radio and Ag. Deputy Chief of Public Information for the United Nations in Liberia introduced me to media training, the donor world and projects. Together, we registered Wayamo Foundation becoming the main contact and training organization for Kenyan journalists reporting on the ICC.\n\nWe later expanded to capacity building for prosecutors, investigators, and judges in East Africa intending to enhance their skills and knowledge to address transnational organized crimes such as terrorism, money laundering, wildlife crimes, cybercrime, and among others human trafficking. I was the East Africa coordinator of the project which also incorporated East African media as a key partner. Later, we expanded our network to training the military in Nigeria in Wayamo\u2019s quest to address the eyesore of the Boko Haram.\n\nIn 2020, I was among the 10 fellows who won the Resilience Fellowship of the Global Initiative against Transnational Organized Crime (GI-TOC), Austria. Until June this year, I have been reporting and researching on human trafficking and harvesting of human body organs in East Africa.\n\nAnd through this reporting, in December 2020, I won the Labour Migration Awards for the Migration and Health category due to my role in exploring the safety of victims of human trafficking during the covid-19 pandemic.\n\nThe awards were organized by the African Women in Media in partnership with the African Union, International Labour Organisation, and the International Organization for Migration (IOM).\n\nOther defining moments in my career are participation in the U.S sponsored Edward R. Murrow Programme which enhanced my skills in leadership and excellence in journalism. It shaped my leadership in journalism as a mentor of the U.S Embassy-sponsored programmes for female journalism university students and training of vernacular radio journalists across Kenya.\n\nIn 2020, I also joined Journalists for Human Rights (JHR), Canada World: Voice for Women and Girls\u2019 Rights Kenya as a Gender Media Trainer.\n\nThis has been my springboard to living the dream of what I have always wanted to do- train and mentor journalists on how to report on gender with a link to human rights. To report on gender requires journalists to link their reports to human rights to give issues on gender context and also demonstrate the seriousness of violating them.\n\n1. That\u2019s an amazing journey and congratulations on your recent appointment as the Executive Director at AMWIK! What does this position mean to you and why do you believe that having more women in the C-Suite is so impactful?\n\nThis position is important to me, to female journalists and the entire media industry. It means that I have more influence, support and the leeway to push for a gender-equal society that I have been doing as a journalist and media trainer.\n\nI have trained different groups to push for an inclusive society in political leadership, economic development, and recognition that men and women are equal partners whose contribution to society matters. I believe it is important to interrogate inwardly as the media because we cannot push for gender equality in society yet we are suffering from the same inadequacies.\n\nThough we have made commendable strides, the number of women at the decision-making table in our media organizations is still low. The ripple effect of having fewer women in the newsroom and deciding on the content, prioritization of news, and determining who the sources are suffers similar inefficiencies. This leads to poor coverage of women and issues that affect them hence undermining their capability as important news sources in political and economic matters.\n\nNot having their voices heard means issues that undermine women, violate their rights, and block them from equal opportunities will continue to interfere with their lives and muzzle their opinions which count and contribute positively to the economy, democracy, and societal development. I have the opportunity to lead AMWIK to build on existing networks and diversify to reach out to other like-minded organizations in our quest for a gender-equal society.\n\n2. What should we be looking for in your leadership?\n\nMy experience in journalism, media training, and project management of donor-funded programmes are one of the approaches I intend to leverage to expand AMWIK\u2019s base of partners and galvanize the existing ones.\n\nSo far, I have received overwhelming support from stakeholders in the media, AMWIK members, partners, and organizations that I have worked with before and this means that their support is integral in the implementation of AMWIK\u2019s programmes. I appreciate the Media Council of Kenya, the Kenya Editors Guild, and the Kenya Union of Journalists, among many other organizations, for pledging to support AMWIK.\n\nI intend to diversify AMWIK\u2019s areas of focus to capture emerging issues that undermine the fight for gender equity. As we look at elections in 2022, AMWIK has a big role to play not only to support female political aspirants but to also highlight challenges that they face and interrogate ways in which they can be addressed.\n\n3. Having worked in the Media in Kenya and Germany, in NGOs and participated in international conferences, please share some ways women can best position themselves for opportunities and rise the ranks?\n\n\uf076 Don\u2019t give up on your dreams. Never allow your limitations to deter you from going after your dreams e.g In my case the heavy Kimeru accent. Do whatever it takes to overcome the hurdle and attain your dreams.\n\n\uf076 Be willing to do things differently. Focus on adding value. Whether it is story ideas or projects, I strive to identify what will make my work unique and stand out especially in addressing unresolved issues and pushing for impact. It is not easy, it requires a lot of research and reading to have local and international perspectives, but it is doable.\n\n\uf076 Network! I can never overemphasize this. I am one of those people who will go anywhere without any allowance or pay for the sake of networking. Sometimes I give pro-bono training with the bigger picture-to network and establish long-term solid networks. I look at it as an opportunity to advertise my skills and prove that I can do it. After some time, I always reap big as a professional and an important partner with the organizations I interact with.\n\n\uf076 Strive for impact. I don\u2019t trade perfection for anything. I remain professional and leave a lasting memory by doing tasks assigned to me to the best of my ability. This has enabled me to continue to work with reputable institutions and organizations locally and internationally. And while at it, never forgo opportunities because they seem hard, just try.\n\n4. As an award-winning journalist with 11 awards, tell us what these awards mean to you and other young women who look up to you. Any tips for young journalists hoping to excel in the media industry?\n\nThe awards remind me that there is a reward for sacrifices made; by getting out of the comfort zone to sometimes risk my life to tell stories of ordinary people, to highlight their issues, expose the gaps and offer solutions that could close these gaps.\n\nThe awards encourage me to practice journalism that is people-centered \u2013 always for the public good. To do this, being ethical is mandatory because all reputable organizations prefer to work with professionals who understand the job, how it is done, and in the right way.\n\nI have used this rich experience in journalism to mentor many journalists in the 100s either directly or through training. I keep urging them to sharpen their skills and strive to be unique. They should never get tired of attending fellowships, training and any other opportunities because these open doors to excellence and career progression.\n\nWith adequate knowledge and skills, we can drop the stereotypical and patriarchal tags that block female journalists from reporting on difficult subjects and also rising to the decision-making level. These insulate us from challenges such as sexual favours accorded to cover up for our inadequacies. We don\u2019t need favours, we want to be given jobs because we can deliver because we are good at it - this should be the motto. Our defence is professionalism.\n\nJudie Kaberia\n\n5. You are the board chair of Africa Check Foundation in Kenya, a subsidiary of Africa Check Trust, Africa\u2019s leading independent fact-checking organization. What does it take to run this board?\n\nI oversee the statutory umbrella operations in Africa check, in Kenya. Also, in my oversight role, I get to mainstream conversations about fact-checking and the need for accurate information.\n\nThe reason I emphasize the importance for public figures or persons in authority to speak based on evidence and give information based on facts. I provoke conversations to influence policy so that leaders are aware that they have a responsibility to be honest whenever they make public statements. Misinformation and disinformation can affect people\u2019s lives negatively because they rely on information to make decisions about their health, their investments and basically about their lives.\n\n6. None of us can achieve success without some help along the way. Is there a particular person(s) who you are grateful to who held your hand along your career journey?\n\nI have many mentors, some are my peers or even younger than me. I have a strong support system, - a friend who is more than a sister. She is visionary and she insists on having a complete life that balances our spiritual, family, economic, and career lives. Betsy Warui has been that person that helps me strike a balance in my life, through her advice and sharing.\n\nProfessor Nancy Booker believed I could become a good media trainer when I didn\u2019t believe in myself. She paved way for me to become an accomplished media trainer and share my knowledge and skills in journalism with others.\n\nPamela Sittoni, Bettina Ambach, Christine Nguku, Alphonse Shiundu, Njeri Rugene, Jim Onyango, Njeri Kabeberi are other mentors I look up to. I am grateful that they have inspired me to excel in my career by also giving me a chance to exhibit my skills as a media trainer and seasoned journalist.\n\nFor the last four years, I have also been a mentor of the International Association of Women in Radio and Television (IAWRT) where we have prepared over 50 female students studying journalism for the job market. We also discuss challenges they are likely to face in the media and give them tips on how to overcome them and focus on their careers and also rise to excellence.\n\n7. With such a flourishing career we asked Judie what values keep you grounded and shape the way you work and live?\n\n\uf0fc Integrity. This has made me become a well-respected journalist and an accomplished media trainer. Journalism is also about leadership; being responsible knowing that the public trusts us to lead them through the information or reports we do. Integrity has borne excellence especially in my leadership and management of people.\n\n\uf0fc Discernment. I always pray for a spirit of discernment. I have gone through a rough terrain, at some point I didn\u2019t know if I would ever lift myself because I made wrong decisions. But this has helped me learn from my mistakes which is the reason why I am keen and take my time before passing judgments, whether it is about myself or others. I don\u2019t discredit people, cut them out, let them into my life or trust them with assignments or certain information. This reduces the chances of falling into deep pits in my personal and career life. It is good to have personal boundaries and know up where do we let people in our lives, and which people.\n\n8. Lastly, given an opportunity to re-imagine the world (for women and girls), is there is anything you would change? If yes, what will it be and why?\n\nFirst I would empower them to believe in themselves, their capabilities, and that there is nothing that limits them from becoming who they want to be.\n\nI would want them to know what their rights are. Because when they are aware of their rights, they will fight for their place. They will not be silenced when they want to speak about violations and when they want to participate in any debates, whether simple or complex. They have all it takes and it is their right to participate actively.\n\nI would want them to know that culture is good but bad practices that demean and hurt them are not important and it is their right to rebuke them. This is why 2022 is a year to watch as Kenya nears its deadline to end Female Genital Mutilation.\n\nIt should be mandatory for girls and women to go to school and ensure policies are formulated and implemented to ensure their right to education is not violated no matter the situation. This is why we need to push the duty bearer to fully implement the return to school policy for teen mothers, and demand for resources to be allocated for affected girls to continue with their education without stigma.\n\n2022 is also important because we want to see a change in political leadership in Kenya. Though we have made progress, we cannot sit comfortably when female representation in political leadership is not near 50%. We have to actively encourage and support women to participate as candidates and voters by removing hurdles that deny them the right to participate in the democratic process. They too can lead and have what it takes to lead Kenya into economic, political and social stability.", "articleBodyHtml": "<article>\n\n<p>In our segment of #KenyaWomenSeries, we feature, Judie Kaberia.\u00a0Kaberia has eleven awards to her name as a multimedia journalist, she is an accomplished media trainer and mentor, with over 15 years of experience in journalism.</p>\n\n<p>Recently, she was appointed Executive Director of the Association of Media Women in Media (AMWIK).\u00a0Judie Kaberia\u2019s career in the media began at Radio Waumini as a reporter, producer, and later as an editor.</p>\n\n<p>\u201cI was a rookie when I joined Radio Waumini, which provided me with the platform to make all the mistakes and learn from them.

This leads to poor coverage of women and issues that affect them hence undermining their capability as important news sources in political and economic matters.</p>\n\n<p>Not having their voices heard means issues that undermine women, violate their rights, and block them from equal opportunities will continue to interfere with their lives and muzzle their opinions which count and contribute positively to the economy, democracy, and societal development. I have the opportunity to lead AMWIK to build on existing networks and diversify to reach out to other like-minded organizations in our quest for a gender-equal society.</p>\n\n<p>2. <strong>What should we be looking for in your leadership?\n</strong></p>\n\n<p>My experience in journalism, media training, and project management of donor-funded programmes are one of the approaches I intend to leverage to expand AMWIK\u2019s base of partners and galvanize the existing ones.</p>\n\n<p>So far, I have received overwhelming support from stakeholders in the media, AMWIK members, partners, and organizations that I have worked with before and this means that their support is integral in the implementation of AMWIK\u2019s programmes. I appreciate the Media Council of Kenya, the Kenya Editors Guild, and the Kenya Union of Journalists, among many other organizations, for pledging to support AMWIK.</p>\n\n<p>I intend to diversify AMWIK\u2019s areas of focus to capture emerging issues that undermine the fight for gender equity. As we look at elections in 2022, AMWIK has a big role to play not only to support female political aspirants but to also highlight challenges that they face and interrogate ways in which they can be addressed.</p>\n\n<p>3. <strong>Having worked in the Media in Kenya and Germany, in NGOs and participated in international conferences, please share some ways women can best position themselves for opportunities and rise the ranks? \n</strong></p>\n\n<p>\uf076\tDon\u2019t give up on your dreams. Never allow your limitations to deter you from going after your dreams e.g In my case the heavy Kimeru accent. Do whatever it takes to overcome the hurdle and attain your dreams.</p>\n\n<p>\uf076\t Be willing to do things differently. Focus on adding value. Whether it is story ideas or projects, I strive to identify what will make my work unique and stand out especially in addressing unresolved issues and pushing for impact. It is not easy, it requires a lot of research and reading to have local and international perspectives, but it is doable.</p>\n\n<p>\uf076\t Network! I can never overemphasize this. I am one of those people who will go anywhere without any allowance or pay for the sake of networking. Sometimes I give pro-bono training with the bigger picture-to network and establish long-term solid networks. I look at it as an opportunity to advertise my skills and prove that I can do it. After some time, I always reap big as a professional and an important partner with the organizations I interact with.</p>\n\n<p>\uf076\t Strive for impact. I don\u2019t trade perfection for anything. I remain professional and leave a lasting memory by doing tasks assigned to me to the best of my ability. This has enabled me to continue to work with reputable institutions and organizations locally and internationally. And while at it, never forgo opportunities because they seem hard, just try.</p>\n\n<p>4. <strong>As an award-winning journalist with 11 awards, tell us what these awards mean to you and other young women who look up to you. Any tips for young journalists hoping to excel in the media industry? \n</strong></p>\n\n<p>The awards remind me that there is a reward for sacrifices made; by getting out of the comfort zone to sometimes risk my life to tell stories of ordinary people, to highlight their issues, expose the gaps and offer solutions that could close these gaps.</p>\n\n<p>The awards encourage me to practice journalism that is people-centered \u2013 always for the public good. To do this, being ethical is mandatory because all reputable organizations prefer to work with professionals who understand the job, how it is done, and in the right way.</p>\n\n<p>I have used this rich experience in journalism to mentor many journalists in the 100s either directly or through training. I keep urging them to sharpen their skills and strive to be unique. They should never get tired of attending fellowships, training and any other opportunities because these open doors to excellence and career progression.</p>\n\n<p>With adequate knowledge and skills, we can drop the stereotypical and patriarchal tags that block female journalists from reporting on difficult subjects and also rising to the decision-making level. These insulate us from challenges such as sexual favours accorded to cover up for our inadequacies. We don\u2019t need favours, we want to be given jobs because we can deliver because we are good at it - this should be the motto. Our defence is professionalism.</p>\n\n<p><img src=\"https://www.nairobileo.co.ke/uploads/posts/IMG-20210804221047.jpeg\"><br></p>\n\n<p><em>Judie Kaberia\u00a0</em></p>\n\n<p>5. <strong>You are the board chair of Africa Check Foundation in Kenya, a subsidiary of Africa Check Trust, Africa\u2019s leading independent fact-checking organization. What does it take to run this board?  \n</strong></p>\n\n<p>I oversee the statutory umbrella operations in Africa check, in Kenya. Also, in my oversight role, I get to mainstream conversations about fact-checking and the need for accurate information.</p>\n\n<p>The reason I emphasize the importance for public figures or persons in authority to speak based on evidence and give information based on facts. I provoke conversations to influence policy so that leaders are aware that they have a responsibility to be honest whenever they make public statements. Misinformation and disinformation can affect people\u2019s lives negatively because they rely on information to make decisions about their health, their investments and basically about their lives.</p>\n\n<p>6. <strong>None of us can achieve success without some help along the way. Is there a particular person(s) who you are grateful to who held your hand along your career journey?  \n</strong></p>\n\n<p>I have many mentors, some are my peers or even younger than me. I have a strong support system, - a friend who is more than a sister. She is visionary and she insists on having a complete life that balances our spiritual, family, economic, and career lives. Betsy Warui has been that person that helps me strike a balance in my life, through her advice and sharing.</p>\n\n<p>Professor Nancy Booker believed I could become a good media trainer when I didn\u2019t believe in myself. She paved way for me to become an accomplished media trainer and share my knowledge and skills in journalism with others.</p>\n\n<p>Pamela Sittoni, Bettina Ambach, Christine Nguku, Alphonse Shiundu, Njeri Rugene, Jim Onyango, Njeri Kabeberi are other mentors I look up to. I am grateful that they have inspired me to excel in my career by also giving me a chance to exhibit my skills as a media trainer and seasoned journalist.</p>\n\n<p>For the last four years, I have also been a mentor of the International Association of Women in Radio and Television (IAWRT) where we have prepared over 50 female students studying journalism for the job market. We also discuss challenges they are likely to face in the media and give them tips on how to overcome them and focus on their careers and also rise to excellence.</p>\n\n<p>7. <strong>With such a flourishing career we asked Judie what values keep you grounded and shape the way you work and live? \n</strong></p>\n\n<p>\uf0fc\tIntegrity. This has made me become a well-respected journalist and an accomplished media trainer. Journalism is also about leadership; being responsible knowing that the public trusts us to lead them through the information or reports we do. Integrity has borne excellence especially in my leadership and management of people.</p>\n\n<p>\uf0fc\tDiscernment. I always pray for a spirit of discernment. I have gone through a rough terrain, at some point I didn\u2019t know if I would ever lift myself because I made wrong decisions. But this has helped me learn from my mistakes which is the reason why I am keen and take my time before passing judgments, whether it is about myself or others. I don\u2019t discredit people, cut them out, let them into my life or trust them with assignments or certain information. This reduces the chances of falling into deep pits in my personal and career life. It is good to have personal boundaries and know up where do we let people in our lives, and which people.</p>\n\n<p><img src=\"https://www.nairobileo.co.ke/uploads/posts/IMG-20210804221120.jpeg\"><br></p>\n\n<p>8. <strong>Lastly, given an opportunity to re-imagine the world (for women and girls), is there is anything you would change? If yes, what will it be and why?\n</strong></p>\n\n<p>First I would empower them to believe in themselves, their capabilities, and that there is nothing that limits them from becoming who they want to be.</p>\n\n<p>I would want them to know what their rights are. Because when they are aware of their rights, they will fight for their place. They will not be silenced when they want to speak about violations and when they want to participate in any debates, whether simple or complex. They have all it takes and it is their right to participate actively.</p>\n\n<p>I would want them to know that culture is good but bad practices that demean and hurt them are not important and it is their right to rebuke them. This is why 2022 is a year to watch as Kenya nears its deadline to end Female Genital Mutilation.</p>\n\n<p>It should be mandatory for girls and women to go to school and ensure policies are formulated and implemented to ensure their right to education is not violated no matter the situation. This is why we need to push the duty bearer to fully implement the return to school policy for teen mothers, and demand for resources to be allocated for affected girls to continue with their education without stigma.</p>\n\n<p>2022 is also important because we want to see a change in political leadership in Kenya. Though we have made progress, we cannot sit comfortably when female representation in political leadership is not near 50%. We have to actively encourage and support women to participate as candidates and voters by removing hurdles that deny them the right to participate in the democratic process. They too can lead and have what it takes to lead Kenya into economic, political and social stability.</p>\n\n</article>", "canonicalUrl": "https://www.nairobileo.co.ke/opinions/3888/how-judie-kaberia-moved-from-intern-at-radio-waumini-to-executive-director-at-amwik"},{"url": "https://www.nairobileo.co.ke/opinions/3632/wanja-maina-founder-of-friends-of-wanja-initiative-empowering-learners-with-disabilities", "probability": 0.9905371, "headline": "Wanja Maina: Founder of \u2018Friends of Wanja Initiative\u2019 Empowering Learners with Disabilities", "datePublished": "2021-07-15T09:34:30.034385", "datePublishedRaw": "5 months ago", "author": "Nairobi Leo", "authorsList": ["Nairobi Leo"], "inLanguage": "en", "breadcrumbs": [{"name": "Home", "link": "https://www.nairobileo.co.ke/"}, {"name": "Opinions", "link": "https://www.nairobileo.co.ke/opinions"}, {"name": "Wanja Maina: Founder of \u2018Friends of Wanja Initiative\u2019 Empowering Learners with Disabilities"}], "mainImage": "https://www.nairobileo.co.ke/uploads/posts/IMG-20210714203353.JPG", "images": ["https://www.nairobileo.co.ke/uploads/posts/IMG-20210714203353.JPG", "https://www.nairobileo.co.ke/uploads/posts/IMG-20210714202116.jpeg", "https://www.nairobileo.co.ke/uploads/posts/IMG-20210714202305.jpeg", "https://www.nairobileo.co.ke/uploads/posts/IMG-20210714202039.jpeg", "https://www.nairobileo.co.ke/uploads/posts/IMG-20210714202155.jpeg"], "description": "In our segment of #KenyaWomenSeries, we feature, Wanja Maina.

An inclusion advocate and the founder of \u201cFriends of Wanja Initiative, a mentorship programme at Joy-Town Primary School that supports learners with disabilities to feel empowered to learn. Others describe her as the influential face behind Hummingbird+.\n\nWell, she describes herself as a global citizen and sees the world as a place of unlimited possibilities where we are all called, not only to improve our lives, but also the lives of those around us.\n\nShe has defied all odds by showing that persons living with disabilities are not objects of pity who always need to be helped. Her activism around inclusion of persons with disabilities has been celebrated, nationally and internationally, earning her several titles under her name.\n\nShe enjoys travelling, cooking, creating, and consuming great content.\n\n\u201cI started the \u201cFriends of Wanja Initiative\u201d when I was in my second year at the University. The aim was and still is, to successfully get people on a weekend to spend time with students with disabilities for mentorship. The intention is to bridge the existing gap in terms of people who deliberately mentor and hold the hands of students with disabilities because, often society acts like it does not expect them to succeed as much.\n\nSince its inception, the initiative has touched the lives of over 2,000 learners with disabilities and their parents. Parents of people with disabilities require mentorship too and encouragement so that they can see their children as people who have a future. I love doing it because I know too well, I have come this far because of mentors and people who inspire me and make me see the world in a positive light.\n\nNo one really chooses to be different in life. It is easier when you are like everyone else and when you blend in and be just like your peers. You see, I was born a normal child but at the age of four, I became unwell. It was described as normal fevers that are common with all other children. Then I was taken to the hospital and an injection gone wrong led to my disability. This is what we call professional and medical negligence. Sadly, there are so many people who have suffered through this path.\n\n1. You run a Facebook page called the Hummingbird+ that has a huge following and where you share stories that impact lives. What was the inspiration behind starting the page. Any impact so far?\n\nThe page is my brainchild. I love to create content and to have an outlet where I can write the things I care about. It has grown organically to over 250,000 followers and going strong. I also started the page because I noticed there are many stories out there that never see the light of day on mainstream media.\n\nSometimes these stories on Hummingbird+ catch the eye of mainstream media who pick it and run with it. I like to write about people\u2019s achievements, gender-related topics, and inspiring figures in our community.\n\nThe page is also an avenue for me to share stories about myself. If you look at the media both mainstream and social media, people with disabilities are portrayed as objects of pity and people who always need to be helped; The danger of a single story by Chimamanda.\n\nI am a Kenyan, young urbanite woman who is living boldly despite my challenges. It is self-advocacy in a way. I would like to see media represent diverse people. We all have a role in questioning why people looking differently are not featured on media. Representation is very important in my view.\n\n2. Having been in mainstream disability activism for the past 12 years, what are some of your proudest moments and the events that have shaped these?\n\nWhen you have a disability of whatever form, you start feeling and seeing life differently from a young age. While in Primary school; a special school in Thika called Joytown Primary School, I started a \u201cquiet revolution\u201d questioning why our friends who used wheelchairs were sitting together in a secluded room in the dining hall while the rest of us were seated in the hall. It did not make sense to me. I felt that all students should sit wherever they wanted.\n\nThis revolution worked magic. I started by bringing one of my friends to sit with us during lunchtime, and before we knew it, the secluded room was almost empty. For me being an activist/advocate is not a profession but a way of life. We live in a world that oppresses people, especially women and there is a need for us to push back and say hell no!\n\nMy activism work has been appreciated and awarded by different organizations including the United Nation agencies and the Government of Kenya. There are many people who know me and appreciate my bold, outspoken nature. A few weeks ago I was featured in the Daily Nation as one of the young women advocates on inclusion. In April 2021 I was voted as the most prominent and influential young person with a disability.\n\nMy proudest moment at the end of the day is that when I sit and curl up in my little grey sofa in my apartment, I know that I have used my voice as a force for good and that someone out there is getting educated or living an improved life because I chose to speak up.\n\n3. With the onset of COVID-19 in Kenya in March 2020, you began coordinating a disability and COVID-19 loose network of 25 organisations of people with disabilities across Kenya. Please share with us your experience coordinating this and some of the challenges and lessons learnt.\n\nAs we came to terms with the reality that COVID-19 was here with us people started organizing, getting food donations and cash transfers. But I realized no one was planning or pushing for people with disabilities to get food, money etc. I took the opportunity and set up a team and we immediately put our heads to work, luckily, our coordinated efforts unlocked resources.\n\nAMREF Kenya trained PWDs in nine Counties on Coronavirus and prevention, as well as donating Personal Protective Equipment. UNFPA gave girls and women with disabilities some dignity packs and the National Youth council gave food and sanitizers to PWDs. Many PWDs were quickly added to the cash transfer lists by the government. I am happy because I learnt one lesson; not to think that others should take lead, if it is important to you wake up and take the lead.\n\n4. Please enlighten us about some of the ways we can support disability inclusion in the COVID-19 response?\n\nThe Government and others involved should worry about the \u201cweakest link\u201d. We are as strong as the weakest link. Why are people with disabilities not on top of the list of priorities when it comes to people being vaccinated? It is sad as PWDs are among the most at risk if you look at it critically.\n\nThere is also a big need for programming around sexual and gender-based violence that touches on women and girls with disabilities. The cases are so many and almost normalized which should never be the case. We need dedicated resources towards curbing this vice.\n\nLastly, you cannot shave a man in his absence. How comes not many PWDs sit on decision-making committees and tables?\n\n5. You have served on several boards, please tell us about some of them and your experience serving there.\n\n\uf0d8 The National Government Affirmative action fund Nairobi County. I learnt the sad reality that PWDs are often left behind in terms of access to funds meant for affirmative groups. When I served there, I pushed to have more PWDs get affirmative funds and bursaries. I am happy that many people were able to benefit and many kids were able to access education because I was in the room and spoke.\n\n\uf0d8 The Nairobi County Youth Board (2013 to 2017) under Governor Evans Kidero. I was very instrumental in voicing challenges of PWDs to the office of the Governor. I lobbied and pushed names of students to be on the bursary list where the Governor was sponsoring them at 100 per cent. One of those that I pushed for is now in second year doing Actuarial Science at a local University.\n\n\uf0d8 UNFPA Youth Advisory Panel; an organ advising UNFPA Kenya on how their programming can be more youth and disability friendly. I travelled and got an opportunity to bring others along which was instrumental as travel opens one\u2019s mind and breaks down preconceived stereotypes. It remains my proudest moment to know that all is not lost and that our voices matter.\n\n\uf0d8 Karuri Gakure Secondary Board of Management. This year we have taken one student to the university. It has taken us six years to get here. Considering the entry behaviour with students who have scored less than 200 marks in KCPE, we count that as success.\n\n\uf0d8 African youth and adolescents\u2019 network. I sit in the executive committee and contribute effectively on youth matters in the East and Southern African region.\n\n6. Please talk to us about \u2018The Global Diva Ambassador Program (GDAP)\u2019 an outreach program that seeks to shape the perception of what \u201cdisability\u201d looks like by promoting women of colour through various media platforms, and which you are one of their ambassadors.\n\nThis program was started by Dr. Donna Rena Walton a prominent woman with a disability in America. She is well respected in many circles including Hollywood circles. She asks why certain people are never considered for advertising and in movies. Why for example don\u2019t we see a person with a disability in Kenya advertising a fizzled drink or a fast-moving consumer good or a restaurant?\n\nWhy is it that on media people with disabilities are beggars and often portrayed as seeking or in need of pity? In my role as an ambassador, I am fighting against this seclusion. I hope and pray that soon I will be able to talk about products I love because I am a consumer i.e marketing and influencing them.\n\nIt is great to be part of this program as I have become more critical and more aware of representation. I have also interacted with Americans who are black/ people of colour and yes, racism and this seclusion is very much alive in 2021. We need a big change!\n\n7. If you were to choose two values that are most important to you that you live by and keep you grounded and shape the way you work and live, what would they be and why?\n\n\uf0fc Authenticity. I like to be real. What you see is what you get. I like to speak and write about what I feel and what I am convinced about without worry that the world is judging me. Sometimes adulting comes with lots of fakeness and the need to conform. I pray that I remain authentic, real and strong without the pressure to pretend.\n\n\uf0fc Faith. In a world where I am likely to be overlooked and passed by when it comes to opportunities, I choose faith in myself, in my action and my day-to-day life. Faith comes with the boldness to say that I am equally deserving and capable, and I am in the room as an equal, and not as a tokenism gesture.\n\n8. How do you describe yourself, and how do others describe you?\n\nI am a strong-willed person who believes that my voice matters, one who sees good in others. I am scared of failure. This is my biggest weakness, but I am working on it.\n\nOthers say I am bold, confident and capable of much more. However, they point that I am not very patient especially when I do not see the light or when something does not make sense to me. I am working on building the virtue of patience.\n\n9. Any parting shot?\n\nWhen one has a disability and is a woman, they experience double marginalization. Constantly pushing boundaries and advocating for self and others can leave one stretched too thin and drained. I, therefore, wish to emphasize the need for mental health and well-being for activists and advocates because one cannot pour from an empty cup.\n\nKenya has a huge population of people with disabilities who are consumers of goods and services across all sectors. Therefore, there is a need for marketers and advertising agencies to look at this population from an economic perspective and tap into it.\n\nLastly, I urge all young women with disabilities to be bold and to speak up, as well as seek opportunities to advance their education. They should horn their skills because they have to be twice as good to be considered which means they will be twice as good in skills.", "articleBodyHtml": "<article>\n\n<p>In our segment of #KenyaWomenSeries, we feature, Wanja Maina.

How comes not many PWDs sit on decision-making committees and tables?</p>\n\n<p>5. <strong>You have served on several boards, please tell us about some of them and your experience serving there.\n</strong></p>\n\n<p>\uf0d8\tThe National Government Affirmative action fund Nairobi County. I learnt the sad reality that PWDs are often left behind in terms of access to funds meant for affirmative groups. When I served there, I pushed to have more PWDs get affirmative funds and bursaries. I am happy that many people were able to benefit and many kids were able to access education because I was in the room and spoke.</p>\n\n<p>\uf0d8\tThe Nairobi County Youth Board (2013 to 2017) under Governor Evans Kidero. I was very instrumental in voicing challenges of PWDs to the office of the Governor. I lobbied and pushed names of students to be on the bursary list where the Governor was sponsoring them at 100 per cent. One of those that I pushed for is now in second year doing Actuarial Science at a local University.</p>\n\n<p>\uf0d8\tUNFPA Youth Advisory Panel; an organ advising UNFPA Kenya on how their programming can be more youth and disability friendly. I travelled and got an opportunity to bring others along which was instrumental as travel opens one\u2019s mind and breaks down preconceived stereotypes. It remains my proudest moment to know that all is not lost and that our voices matter.</p>\n\n<p>\uf0d8\tKaruri Gakure Secondary Board of Management. This year we have taken one student to the university. It has taken us six years to get here. Considering the entry behaviour with students who have scored less than 200 marks in KCPE, we count that as success.</p>\n\n<p>\uf0d8\tAfrican youth and adolescents\u2019 network. I sit in the executive committee and contribute effectively on youth matters in the East and Southern African region.</p>\n\n<figure><p><br><img src=\"https://www.nairobileo.co.ke/uploads/posts/IMG-20210714202155.jpeg\"></p><figcaption><p><em>File Image of Wanja Maina.\u00a0</em></p></figcaption></figure>\n\n<p>6. <strong>Please talk to us about \u2018The Global Diva Ambassador Program (GDAP)\u2019 an outreach program that seeks to shape the perception of what \u201cdisability\u201d looks like by promoting women of colour through various media platforms, and which you are one of their ambassadors.\n</strong></p>\n\n<p>This program was started by Dr. Donna Rena Walton a prominent woman with a disability in America. She is well respected in many circles including Hollywood circles. She asks why certain people are never considered for advertising and in movies. Why for example don\u2019t we see a person with a disability in Kenya advertising a fizzled drink or a fast-moving consumer good or a restaurant?</p>\n\n<p>Why is it that on media people with disabilities are beggars and often portrayed as seeking or in need of pity? In my role as an ambassador, I am  fighting against this seclusion. I hope and pray that soon I will be able to talk about products I love because I am a consumer i.e marketing and influencing them.</p>\n\n<p>It is great to be part of this program as I have become more critical and more aware of representation. I have also interacted with Americans who are black/ people of colour and yes, racism and this seclusion is very much alive in 2021. We need a big change!</p>\n\n<p>7.<strong> If you were to choose two values that are most important to you that you live by and keep you grounded and shape the way you work and live, what would they be and why?\n</strong></p>\n\n<p>\uf0fc\tAuthenticity. I like to be real. What you see is what you get. I like to speak and write about what I feel and what I am convinced about without worry that the world is judging me. Sometimes adulting comes with lots of fakeness and the need to conform. I pray that I remain authentic, real and strong without the pressure to pretend.</p>\n\n<p>\uf0fc\tFaith. In a world where I am likely to be overlooked and passed by when it comes to opportunities, I choose faith in myself, in my action and my day-to-day life. Faith comes with the boldness to say that I am equally deserving and capable, and I am in the room as an equal, and not as a tokenism gesture.</p>\n\n<p>8. <strong>How do you describe yourself, and how do others describe you?\n</strong></p>\n\n<p>I am a strong-willed person who believes that my voice matters, one who sees good in others. I am scared of failure. This is my biggest weakness, but I am working on it.</p>\n\n<p>Others say I am bold, confident and capable of much more. However, they point that I am not very patient especially when I do not see the light or when something does not make sense to me. I am working on building the virtue of patience.</p>\n\n<figure><p><img src=\"https://www.nairobileo.co.ke/uploads/posts/IMG-20210714202305.jpeg\"><br></p><figcaption><p><em>File Image of Wanja Maina.\u00a0</em></p></figcaption></figure>\n\n<p>9.<strong> Any parting shot?\n</strong></p>\n\n<p>When one has a disability and is a woman, they experience double marginalization. Constantly pushing boundaries and advocating for self and others can leave one stretched too thin and drained. I, therefore, wish to emphasize the need for mental health and well-being for activists and advocates because one cannot pour from an empty cup.</p>\n\n<p>Kenya has a huge population of people with disabilities who are consumers of goods and services across all sectors. Therefore, there is a need for marketers and advertising agencies to look at this population from an economic perspective and tap into it.</p>\n\n<p>Lastly, I urge all young women with disabilities to be bold and to speak up, as well as seek opportunities to advance their education. They should horn their skills because they have to be twice as good to be considered which means they will be twice as good in skills.</p>\n\n</article>", "canonicalUrl": "https://www.nairobileo.co.ke/opinions/3632/wanja-maina-founder-of-friends-of-wanja-initiative-empowering-learners-with-disabilities"},{"url": "https://www.nairobileo.co.ke/opinions/3973/cynthia-kimola-kenyan-voice-over-artist-making-boss-moves-locally-and-abroad", "probability": 0.9885513, "headline": "Cynthia Kimola: Kenyan Voice over Artist Making Boss Moves Locally and Abroad", "datePublished": "2021-08-15T09:34:30.127354", "datePublishedRaw": "4 months ago", "author": "Nairobi Leo", "authorsList": ["Nairobi Leo"], "inLanguage": "en", "breadcrumbs": [{"name": "Home", "link": "https://www.nairobileo.co.ke/"}, {"name": "Opinions", "link": "https://www.nairobileo.co.ke/opinions"}, {"name": "Cynthia Kimola: Kenyan Voice over Artist Making Boss Moves Locally and Abroad"}], "mainImage": "https://www.nairobileo.co.ke/uploads/posts/IMG-20210811183054.jpeg", "images": ["https://www.nairobileo.co.ke/uploads/posts/IMG-20210811183054.jpeg", "https://www.nairobileo.co.ke/uploads/posts/IMG-20210811183450.jpeg", "https://www.nairobileo.co.ke/uploads/posts/IMG-20210811183418.jpeg", "https://www.nairobileo.co.ke/uploads/posts/IMG-20210811183338.jpeg"], "description": "In our segment of #KenyaWomenSeries, we feature, Cynthia Kimola.

A journalist, communication consultant, and voice-over artist who recently voiced a promotional piece for US singer Khalid. She considers herself a connector of people because her interactions and notable milestones have arisen from networking in her life.\n\nCynthia Kimola\u2019s distinct voice is one you\u2019ve probably heard; if not on a Kenyan radio, maybe in on an advert. She was the voice behind Kenya\u2019s most memorable Ads as a coastal cow for the KCC Maziwa Origi TV ad. Remember the Ad?\n\nCynthia\u2019s journey in media started at Radio Africa Group as a radio news anchor at Classic 105 and Kiss 100. \u201cWhile in campus at Daystar University, I volunteered my time and skills at the university radio station; 103.1 Shine FM. This helped me amass experience, which I used as my portfolio when applying for the position at Radio Africa Group.\n\nFrom this experience, I always encourage young people to thrust themselves into activities beyond the classroom because you get to network, activate your passions and refine your skills, which will eventually make you stand out amongst your peers.\n\nMy stint in radio lasted about five years before I transitioned into Public Relations and Communication. I was drawn to assist clients to clarify and target their messaging appropriately for greater impact. I am always grateful to Tell-Em Public Relations, an agency that became my first PR home. It was a great learning ground for me and assisted me in refining my skills.\n\nI got to work on various campaigns, a notable one for me being launching MyDawa into the Kenyan market. Working in a team always has challenges, but I learnt that you need to focus on an individual\u2019s strengths and synergy within the team, especially where behaviour change is concerned. I also learnt how to handle people because I would interact with different clients with different temperaments.\n\n1. With your stint in radio, how has this experience shaped the person you are today?\n\nRadio is powerful and has always been my first love. I love the creativity and production that goes into it, especially in radio shows and how strategic things get done. It can hold the audience\u2019s attention and turn them into loyal listeners. Radio is not only for the ear, but it\u2019s a theatre of the mind; you help your listeners to form images through the descriptive nature of your words.\n\nWhile working in radio, I learnt the value of time. A second in radio is quantifiable, and you can either lose or gain a listener with one move. Dead air is a no-no as someone can just switch over to another channel quickly. Also, a second can enable me to edit an audio, a script just before the top of the hour. I learnt to work fast and precisely so as to minimise on-air mistakes.\n\nAnchoring news on a daily basis can also take its toll on your voice; so I learnt how to take care of my voice so that I don\u2019t get sick and lose it. I also grew into myself, became confident in who I am, and was not swayed by people\u2019s expectations because they consider radio personalities as celebrities. The public sometimes can hold you to such high standards. However, the truth is, you are also figuring out life as you go by, only that you are doing life in the limelight.\n\n2. Talk to us about your transition to PR and Communications, and also about you being a professional English and Kiswahili voice-over artist specialising in regional and international TV & radio ads.\n\nIn 2016, I left radio news to pursue PR & Communications because I loved strategy and helping companies and individuals to package messages correctly for their target audiences. So far, it has been amazing, and I\u2019m still pursuing it.\n\nAs a child, I was always fascinated by voice-overs in radio & TV ads and documentaries. While at the University radio station, I would do ads for my show, the station and other people\u2019s shows. In 2012, I got my big break with voice over on TV with the KCC Maziwa Oriji ad. I then started pursuing voice-overs on and off and landed several local jobs over the years.\n\nHowever, in 2020, I re-evaluated my life, and I realised among the things that I liked to do included voice-overs. So I started handling it seriously and referring to it as a business. It has been amazing so far as I have managed to work with several local, regional and international companies. Recently, I voiced a promotional piece for US singer Khalid\u2019s new single dubbed New Normal, which was really exciting.\n\nI love using my voice to turn ideas into life. This path has been quite fulfilling as I have worked with notable brands such as Google, YouTube, UNICEF, Safaricom, WHO, KCB Bank, Standard Chartered Bank, L\u2019Oreal, Canadian Red Cross, Microsoft and much more.\n\n3. You are a #Chevening alumnus of 2018/2019; briefly tell us about your experience as a Chevener and some things that have arisen from this experience?\n\nA chance meeting, an interaction brought about by the meshing of ideas, has always led me to connect with people who share similar interests. Through that, I have also benefited from their referrals when the time arose. The Chevening Scholarship was one of those.\n\nI was introduced to the idea of studying abroad and scholarships in the UK through a friend. Upon further research, I was captivated by the values and offering of the Chevening Scholarship, so I applied for it. This leap of faith led me to the most memorable two years of my late 20s.\n\nThe application experience helped me to reflect on my life journey so far, the achievements I had garnered, and the trajectory I wanted my life to take in my 30\u2019s. It also fast-tracked my self-confidence and self-belief because, for those who know, the scholarship application period can really take a toll on you and awaken fears and doubts that you had buried in the abyss. But self-belief, affirmations, prayer and determination coupled with adequate preparation helped me emerge victoriously.\n\nI made global friendships whilst in the UK, adapted to a new culture, a completely shocking climate and enjoyed a new way of life - I found out that I was resilient and adaptive to change. I also realised that universal morals like kindness, love, decency are the same throughout and that I am not a lesser person just because I was born in Africa. In fact, I became more secure in my identity.\n\nAs a way to give back, I started a YouTube channel and website. The goal is to guide African students who have the desire to study abroad. They also get to see someone who looks like them who did it and offer tips to make their application journey a bit easier.\n\nWe are living in a global village, and everything is interconnected. So choose where most opportunities for growth lie for you. If you decide to study abroad, don\u2019t feel pressured to come back home because it is \u2018noble\u2019 - do what feels right for you. If you want to come back and pass on the knowledge or localise what you have learnt, then go ahead and do so; if you\u2019re going to stay back and experience life as a professional there, then do so if permitted. We all have individual paths to pursue, and it\u2019s important to stay true to you.\n\n4. Drawing from your personal experience, please tell us what role each of the following has played in your career journey.\n\n\uf0d8 Confidence. It has also helped me to be true to myself. So if I don\u2019t know something, I know that doesn\u2019t devalue me in any way, and I can be confident enough to train, learn, seek help or research if needed. Confidence has also helped me go after opportunities that I may not be qualified 100% for, but I have transferable skills that I am sure will help me succeed in the role.\n\n\uf0d8 Networking. I am where I am because of networking. From my first job to the job I hold now, to scholarships I won, conferences and awards I have been invited to, I have all been made aware of them because of the circles I am in. Talking to people within and outside my field has really helped me to be on people\u2019s radar when anything that fits my profile crops up. Social media is also the new way to network. So use it strategically as it has more reach. You can now easily network with people globally and access people who otherwise would have been inaccessible, like CEOs. Just be respectful and empathetic when you do so, and you will open yourself up to opportunities beyond your imagination.\n\n\uf0d8 Positive attitude. It\u2019s the foundation of all success. It opens you up to try out new things. The positive and can-do attitude helped me to step out of my comfort zone and learn new skills \u2013from a news anchor to a PR & Communications professional and now a voice-over artist.\n\n\uf0d8 Mentorship. My approach has been to select a person whose ideal appeals to me, whose work I look up to, emulate and study them to know what drives them, what makes them tick, their values and I apply them in my life. In terms of guiding others, I do my best whenever I can. I like working with self-driven people who are determined in their life quests and not just waiting to be spoon-fed. I like people who have the willpower to do some self-discovery and then come back for assistance with decision making, weighing options etc. Those who actually apply the lessons, the ideas we discuss and make progress really motivate me to keep helping others out. This is the essence of mentorship.\n\n6. For young people hoping to venture into voicing as a profession, what does it take to be a voice-over artist, how does one market themselves, or even source for clients?\n\n\uf0fc Be eloquent, passionate and have a sincere desire to be one.\n\n\uf0fc Be patient. The jobs may come in slowly, and sometimes, your big break may take a while.\n\n\uf0fc Be trainable. You don\u2019t need to have a stunning voice. You can be trained. I also noticed that clients are nowadays gravitating towards a conversational read. But if you have a great voice, you are already one step up!\n\n\uf0fc Create a portfolio. Do DIY demos by voicing some of your favourite ads or grab them off YouTube and start practising.\n\nAs for marketing\u2026\n\n\uf076 Tell people you are a voice-over artist. Say it like you mean it.\n\n\uf076 Reach out to agencies locally, production companies and even do some things pro-bono as you start.\n\n\uf076 Social media is a great place to market yourself to a broader audience and will increase your visibility if done correctly.\n\n\uf076 Do random cold call or cold emails to clients and let them know of your services and how it will benefit their business.\n\n8. Which is your favourite book, and what are some of its nuggets that apply to the Kenyan professional woman?\n\nThe Richest Man in Babylon by George S. Clason as I am really into financial literacy. We may work so hard and go up the career ladder, but if we don\u2019t have smart money goals and learn to let our money work for us, then all this may be in vain. The book offers financial literacy on saving, increasing your income, diversifying that income, and investing it so that the money continues to grow. I also love Myles Munroe\u2019s book; Understanding your Potential. It helps you to be aware of and maximise the potential of the God-given gifts and talents within you.\n\n8. Your values are the things you believe are important in how you live and work. What two values define you?\n\na) Empathy. This has helped me emotionally understand what other people feel, see things from their point of view, and imagine myself in their place. It has also helped me to be a good communicator and speak to the core of a person.\n\nb) Authenticity. Being true to yourself, your journey, and your values really goes a long way to guide and propel one in decision-making, choosing a career, etc.\n\n9. Any parting shot?\n\nWe all have different paths in life, you may want to get there faster, but there are lessons in the journey that we must learn so that when we reach the top, we can genuinely say we overcame them and made it despite it all.\n\nBe careful and aware of the thoughts you entertain; they guide your life. For example, if you constantly torture yourself by saying that you are not good enough, that is a crutch that will hold you back from ever trying anything.\n\nResist comparison. There is only one of your kind. You are incredible just the way you are. You can aspire for more but do it because it is something that will make you better and not because you want to be like someone else, because you think they are better than you.\n\nAlways pause and smell the roses. Take time out to enjoy yourself, don\u2019t lose touch with the child-like spirit inside of you. That\u2019s the part that makes you dream and activate your imagination, don\u2019t ever lose that.", "articleBodyHtml": "<article>\n\n<p>In our segment of #KenyaWomenSeries, we feature, Cynthia Kimola.

The jobs may come in slowly, and sometimes, your big break may take a while.</p>\n\n<p>\uf0fc\tBe trainable. You don\u2019t need to have a stunning voice. You can be trained. I also noticed that clients are nowadays gravitating towards a conversational read. But if you have a great voice, you are already one step up!</p>\n\n<p>\uf0fc\tCreate a portfolio. Do DIY demos by voicing some of your favourite ads or grab them off YouTube and start practising.</p>\n\n<p>As for marketing\u2026</p>\n\n<p>\uf076\tTell people you are a voice-over artist. Say it like you mean it.</p>\n\n<p>\uf076\t Reach out to agencies locally, production companies and even do some things pro-bono as you start.</p>\n\n<p>\uf076\tSocial media is a great place to market yourself to a broader audience and will increase your visibility if done correctly.</p>\n\n<p>\uf076\tDo random cold call or cold emails to clients and let them know of your services and how it will benefit their business.</p>\n\n<figure><p><img src=\"https://www.nairobileo.co.ke/uploads/posts/IMG-20210811183450.jpeg\"><br></p><figcaption><p><em>Cynthia Kimola\u00a0</em></p></figcaption></figure>\n\n<p>8.<strong> Which is your favourite book, and what are some of its nuggets that apply to the Kenyan professional woman? \n</strong></p>\n\n<p>The Richest Man in Babylon by George S. Clason as I am really into financial literacy. We may work so hard and go up the career ladder, but if we don\u2019t have smart money goals and learn to let our money work for us, then all this may be in vain. The book offers financial literacy on saving, increasing your income, diversifying that income, and investing it so that the money continues to grow. I also love Myles Munroe\u2019s book; Understanding your Potential. It helps you to be aware of and maximise the potential of the God-given gifts and talents within you.</p>\n\n<p>8. <strong>Your values are the things you believe are important in how you live and work. What two values define you?\n</strong></p>\n\n<p>a)\tEmpathy. This has helped me emotionally understand what other people feel, see things from their point of view, and imagine myself in their place. It has also helped me to be a good communicator and speak to the core of a person.</p>\n\n<p>b)\tAuthenticity. Being true to yourself, your journey, and your values really goes a long way to guide and propel one in decision-making, choosing a career, etc.</p>\n\n<p>9. Any parting shot?</p>\n\n<p>We all have different paths in life, you may want to get there faster, but there are lessons in the journey that we must learn so that when we reach the top, we can genuinely say we overcame them and made it despite it all.</p>\n\n<p>Be careful and aware of the thoughts you entertain; they guide your life. For example, if you constantly torture yourself by saying that you are not good enough, that is a crutch that will hold you back from ever trying anything.</p>\n\n<p>Resist comparison. There is only one of your kind. You are incredible just the way you are. You can aspire for more but do it because it is something that will make you better and not because you want to be like someone else, because you think they are better than you.</p>\n\n<p>Always pause and smell the roses. Take time out to enjoy yourself, don\u2019t lose touch with the child-like spirit inside of you. That\u2019s the part that makes you dream and activate your imagination, don\u2019t ever lose that.</p>\n\n</article>", "canonicalUrl": "https://www.nairobileo.co.ke/opinions/3973/cynthia-kimola-kenyan-voice-over-artist-making-boss-moves-locally-and-abroad"},{"url": "https://www.nairobileo.co.ke/news/1848/kenya-records-152-new-covid-19-cases-4-succumb-to-the-disease-cs-mutahi-kagwe", "probability": 0.9820265, "headline": "Kenya Records 152 New Covid-19 Cases, 4 Succumb to the Disease", "datePublished": "2021-03-15T09:34:30.292340", "datePublishedRaw": "9 months ago", "author": "Nairobi Leo", "authorsList": ["Nairobi Leo"], "inLanguage": "en", "breadcrumbs": [{"name": "Home", "link": "https://www.nairobileo.co.ke/"}, {"name": "News", "link": "https://www.nairobileo.co.ke/news"}, {"name": "Kenya Records 152 New Covid-19 Cases, 4 Succumb to the Disease"}], "mainImage": "https://www.nairobileo.co.ke/uploads/posts/IMG-20201124124510.jpg", "images": ["https://www.nairobileo.co.ke/uploads/posts/IMG-20201124124510.jpg"], "description": "152 people have tested positive for the coronavirus in the last 24 hours bringing the country's caseload to 103,993.", "articleBody": "152 people have tested positive for the coronavirus in the last 24 hours bringing the country's caseload to 103,993.\n\nIn a statement, Health CS Mutahi Kagwe confirmed that this was from a sample size of 3734.

", "articleBody": "In our segment of #KenyaWomenSeries, we feature, Lorraine Kirigia. A lady whose life embodies what it means to reset one\u2019s life. At 40 years, she finally aligned her personality with her purpose, and when she did, there was no stopping. She has turned her passion for celebrating life events into business and is the Chief Visionary Officer of Epic Lorraine Life Events (ELLE). She believes she has a calling, to be of service to the community. She is also an avid reader and the incoming President of the Rotary Club of Karen.\n\n\u201cFor the longest time, I struggled to find my purpose. I tried a hand at many things. In 2021, I turned 40years. My prayer was this would be my year to reap. Then on January 8th, I lost a very close friend, and it threw our lives into indescribable pain. From this pain, ELLE was born, after a week of many plans to give our loved one a befitting send-off.\n\nA few friends from the corporate world sat me down in my best friend\u2019s backyard. \u201cIt is time to do events for a living. It is who you are,\u201d they said. These expert ladies wrote a list of things I do so well; organizing epic events, bringing people together whether for business, social, or for a worthy cause- it all comes effortlessly to me. After experimenting with different names looking at my key strengths, ELLE was born, complete with a strategy.\n\nIn February 2021, we registered it and in March we did our first event as ELLE; a charity memorial golf in honour of our friend who passed away in January. It was a resounding success! We have since held Mother\u2019s Day in May for mums in heaven in partnership with Stanbic Bank, Father\u2019s day in June in partnership with Safaricom, July we had Pan African Women\u2019s Day, and just this past week, we hosted a four-day webinar with amazing speakers as we marked the International Youth Week. My biggest wins are having so many people participate in our events and having big brands endorse our events.\n\n1. Currently you serve as the President-Elect of the Rotary Club of Karen (June 2022). Tell us your experience serving in the Rotary club, some of the biggest lessons you have learnt, projects you have been part of and what members of the Rotary Club of Karen should expect from you as the president once you assume office.\n\nGiving back to the community has been at the core of who I am. It is where I find my greatest joy. In 2007 I registered Xmas Torch; an organization that treats and gifts the less privileged, persons with disabilities, those living with HIV & AIDS, and the orphaned children to a Christmas party. Since its inception, we have gifted over 5,000 children countrywide.\n\nA friend who knows my passion for giving invited me to attend a Rotary meeting in 2017 and I completely fell in love with their motto of Service above Self. I was hooked and since then I have served in different roles at my club, The Rotary Club of Karen. I am honoured to be the incoming President.\n\nOne of my greatest experiences as a Rotarian was during the COVID-19 outbreak in 2020. We embarked on a mission to help the surrounding community. We visited the Gataka Village in Karen intending to donate water tanks for hand washing as one way of maintaining hygiene to reduce the Covid-19 transmission. An elderly woman asked us some very pertinent questions. \u201cWell done for bringing us water tanks how kind of you, but have you brought the water with you? Do you know how much I buy a litre of water? So will I buy water to wash my hands or maize flour to feed my grandchildren?\u201d She asked.\n\nBefore we left the village, we bought food for her and a few others. Later, we mobilized the club and shopped for over 100 families within that community. As givers, it is very easy to assume you know what the community needs. This experience emphasized the importance of always carrying out a needs assessment.\n\nAs the incoming President, I plan to use my networking skills and contacts to bring together the business community around us as a club to implement impactful projects around us. We would love to have many business owners join Rotary so we can do more collaboratively.\n\n2. You are a firm believer in celebrating life events. Tell us why you are so passionate about this.\n\nI resonate with this quote by BJ Neblett. \u201cWe are the sum of our experiences. Those experiences \u2013 be they positive or negative \u2013 make us the person we are, at any given point in our lives. And like a flowing river, those same experiences and those yet to come, continue to influence and reshape the person we are, and the person we become. None of us is the same as we were yesterday, nor will be tomorrow.\u201d\n\nI based the ELLE philosophy firmly on the cycle of life. We host memorable events that celebrate, honour or mark significant life moments. We do Bursary Fund Management where we help organizations manage their bursary funds by ensuring needy children access education, mentorship among other benefits.\n\nDuring reunions, the empowered beneficiaries meet and look back on their lives. They celebrate their successes and keep the cycle of life running. The mentees become mentors and give back that which they receive. These we call Look Back events. Reunions aren\u2019t necessarily just for bursary recipients. In 2020, we organized a 50-year reunion for a class that was celebrating 50 years since they joined the Medical School at the University of Nairobi.\n\n3. What are some ways that COVID-19 pandemic has affected the business community? And how can people partner with you?\n\nCOVID-19 has forced us to reset, stop and sit still. I look at the partnerships ELLE has had, for example, they were all purely based on the Ubuntu spirit. We had no numbers to promise these big corporates as a return on investment. Our first two events were purely emotional events- Mother\u2019s and Father\u2019s day. They were all about these companies reminding the country that they care; they feel their pain and are here to celebrate this significant day with them.\n\nELLE is focusing on celebrating days in the calendar that are marked globally. We do it in unique ways and are open to partner with you not just to celebrate the day but to show why it is significant and worth celebrating if at all.\n\n4. Drawing from your personal experience, please tell us what role each of the following has played in your career journey.\n\na). Confidence and Networking.\n\nI started my career selling insurance at a time when insurance sales agents were no one\u2019s favourite. To sell insurance as a young girl from Meru County meant relying heavily on referrals. I am who I am today thanks to this experience. It built my confidence and made me learn to approach anyone, the worst thing a person can tell you is No.\n\nI treasure relationships and I have kept the same networks for over 20 years. The best way this has played out was when I was planning the 2021 International Youth Week. Each day we had different keynote speakers and a minimum of three panellists. Everyone keeps asking me how I did it. Well, I went back to my networks who referred me to different people and made it happen which has now expanded my networks even further!\n\nb). Collaborations and taking risks.\n\nI am a firm believer in co-elevation and collaboration because none of us can succeed alone. There\u2019s power in unity. Unfortunately, most collaborations are not authentic. We fail because of the mentality; what is in it for me moneywise? My advice is that with each collaboration look at what each partner\u2019s strength /value is beyond money.\n\nFor example, for the longest time what I could put on the table wasn\u2019t monetary, it was my skills and networks. I have had some successful outcomes with those who appreciated this, and we built amazing things together. It has also meant having to walk away from many other opportunities. Since ELLE was born, I have had amazing collaborations that have left a significant impact on people\u2019s lives.\n\nThe Alchemist by Paulo Coelho is a book I love. My favourite quote in the book is \u201cWhen you want something the entire universe conspires to help you.\u201d It is not enough to just dream, be that which you want to be and that means taking risks. I have taken enormous risks in life. Sometimes it pays off but even when it doesn\u2019t there is always a lesson; it\u2019s a win-win.\n\n5. If you were to choose the two most important values that you live by and keep you grounded and shape the way you work and live, what would they be and why?\n\n\uf0fc Dependability. I don\u2019t take on anything I can\u2019t give my full attention to. I give my all to people and things I love. You can always count on me 100%.\n\n\uf0fc Visionary. I am the type of person who could be watching something on TV or reading a book and get an AHA moment, and I will spontaneously act on it. This explains why my title is the Chief Visionary Officer of ELLE. I carry the vision which means it comes through me to inspire me but also others. I visualize and dream bigger.\n\n6. As an avid reader, which is your favourite book, and what are some of its nuggets that apply to the Kenyan professional woman?\n\nI have several favorites. Two of them compete for the absolute favourite position. The Outlier is one but when narrowed to one book it has to be; How to Win Friends and Influence People. It gives fundamental tools of how to deal with people which is key in our lives both professionally and socially. My biggest lesson in this book remains the need to be genuinely interested in other people. I live by this and it has gotten me to be where and who I am today.\n\nAny parting shot?\n\nThis has been a year full of mixed feelings. I have had way too many losses (death) people I love and care about or friends of loved ones. But I also took a risk and started ELLE. Recently, I came across this powerful read and it sums it all about where I am.\n\nFollow your Bliss by Joseph Campbell.\n\n\u201cFollow your bliss. If you do follow your bliss, you put yourself on a kind of track that has been there all the while waiting for you, and the life you ought to be living is the one you are living. When you can see that, you begin to meet people who are in the field of your bliss and they open the doors to you. I say follow your bliss and don't be afraid, and doors will open where you didn't know they were going to be. If you follow your bliss, doors will open for you that wouldn't have opened for anyone else.\u201d", "articleBodyHtml": "<article>\n\n<p>In our segment of #KenyaWomenSeries, we feature, Lorraine Kirigia.\u00a0A lady whose life embodies what it means to reset one\u2019s life.

I have had way too many losses (death) people I love and care about or friends of loved ones. But I also took a risk and started ELLE. Recently, I came across this powerful read and it sums it all about where I am.</p>\n\n<p>Follow your Bliss by Joseph Campbell.</p>\n\n<p>\u201cFollow your bliss. If you do follow your bliss, you put yourself on a kind of track that has been there all the while waiting for you, and the life you ought to be living is the one you are living. When you can see that, you begin to meet people who are in the field of your bliss and they open the doors to you. I say follow your bliss and don't be afraid, and doors will open where you didn't know they were going to be. If you follow your bliss, doors will open for you that wouldn't have opened for anyone else.\u201d</p>\n\n</article>", "canonicalUrl": "https://www.nairobileo.co.ke/opinions/4055/lorraine-kirigia-incoming-karen-rotary-club-president-reaping-big-from-passion-of-celebrating-life-events"},{"url": "https://www.nairobileo.co.ke/opinions/3713/crystal-asige-opens-up-on-losing-sight-topping-uk-music-charts-and-mapability-project", "probability": 0.99068147, "headline": "Losing Sight, Topping UK Music Charts and Championing Rights of the Disabled: Moving Story of Crystal Asige", "datePublished": "2021-08-15T09:34:31.115880", "datePublishedRaw": "4 months ago", "author": "Nairobi Leo", "authorsList": ["Nairobi Leo"], "inLanguage": "en", "breadcrumbs": [{"name": "Home", "link": "https://www.nairobileo.co.ke/"}, {"name": "Opinions", "link": "https://www.nairobileo.co.ke/opinions"}, {"name": "Losing Sight, Topping UK Music Charts and Championing Rights of the Disabled: Moving Story of Crystal Asige"}], "mainImage": "https://www.nairobileo.co.ke/uploads/posts/IMG-20210721214508.JPG", "images": ["https://www.nairobileo.co.ke/uploads/posts/IMG-20210721214508.JPG", "https://www.nairobileo.co.ke/uploads/posts/IMG-20210721215536.jpeg", "https://www.nairobileo.co.ke/uploads/posts/IMG-20210721215636.jpeg", "https://www.nairobileo.co.ke/uploads/posts/IMG-20210721215443.jpeg"], "description": "In our segment of #KenyaWomenSeries, we feature, Crystal Asige, an award-winning Artist, YouTuber, and public speaker. ", "articleBody": "In our segment of #KenyaWomenSeries, we feature, Crystal Asige. A lady who after years of trying to figure out her place in the world, finally found her niche which presently reads: An award-winning Artist, Amnesty International Kenya Board member, visual arts trained disability and inclusion champion, YouTuber and public speaker who happens to be blind.\n\nIt is hard to miss Crystal Asige\u2019s great sense of humour. She describes herself as crazy about music, expression, rights and freedoms, diversity and inclusion, as well as a champion for accessibility for all; no matter one\u2019s ability or disability.\n\n\u201c I seek to create awareness around the intersectionalities of being a young, black-African, female entrepreneur and leader with an invisible disability. I endeavor to set up models that disrupt negative perceptions, with the hope that I will have exponential impact in society at large.\n\nHer love with the arts began at an early age when she understood her ability to, and the importance of, standing alone. Inventing songs in my head to express how the bullies in nursery school made me feel sad and lonely at age 3 may have been \u2018cute\u2019 to my mum at the time, but in retrospect Art saves people. Art has the power to transform my sorrows into beauty and to turn my despair into hope.\n\nBrenne Brown puts it this way: music gives our most heart-wrenching pain voice, language and form so that it can be recognized and shared. Even having no way to articulate it as well as she did, somehow I had that deep knowing somewhere inside of me when I sang about the bullies as a little girl to my mum. Isn\u2019t that incredible? Apart from that very significant event, others have been:\n\n\uf0fc Performing internationally.\n\n\uf0fc My music reaching #1 in a UK chart show.\n\n\uf0fc Writing and performing with some of the biggest musicians in East Africa.\n\nBut the most significant to me is being brave enough to dream something and achieving it.\n\n1. Please tell us more about how you lost your sight and your passion for disability rights.\n\nNo one wants to live a life without basic human rights, dignity, integrity, autonomy, or a life where you are invisible, and persons with disabilities are no different.\n\nBecause I wasn\u2019t born like this, my perspective is from both sides of the coin and that\u2019s why I\u2019m so passionate about it. Since High School, my eyesight steadily declined because of glaucoma aka the \u2018silent thief of sight.\u2019\n\nGlaucoma is an eye condition that causes damage to the optic nerve which is important for your vision. With my white cane which I lovingly named Faith (because I walk by faith and not by sight), I now live as a visually impaired person, but personally prefer the term VIP!\n\n2. Tell us some of your experience through this #COVID19, lessons learnt so far and ways we can support disability inclusion in the COVID-19 response.\n\nAs a community, we have been disproportionately affected by the pandemic because our needs and abilities are incredibly more nuanced than the non-disabled. Kenya\u2019s environment was already disabling for us, but now there are massive gaps in the medical facilities such as training of medical staff on how to care for Persons with Disabilities (PWDs). Additionally, there are gaps in accessibility of public transport, building of e-learning platforms, accurate national data on PWDs, sufficient budget allocations, access to information, protection against violence and sexual abuse towards women and girls with disabilities, and sustainable programs to benefit our community, which continue to leave us more vulnerable than ever. I believe Gandhi said a great Nation is measured by how it treats its weakest members.\n\nMy personal challenges have been around these questions:\n\n\uf076 How do I continue checkups with my glaucoma doctors in hospitals that are full?\n\n\uf076 How can I afford to pay for myself and my sighted guide on public transport when prices aren\u2019t being regulated?\n\n\uf076 How can I even social distance at all if I need to grab someone\u2019s elbow to assist me to get around?\n\nWorking online is also challenging because it ends up being a very visual means of communication when others forget there is a visually impaired person in the meeting. Online Government platforms are also very inaccessible for me to navigate. If you ask me, ability mainstreaming must be prioritized otherwise we may be in danger of a very non-inclusive, post-Covid world.\n\n3. You run a YouTube channel Blind Girl Manenoz (BGM). What was the inspiration to start the YouTube channel and what content do you share on it?\n\nBGM came about when I returned home to Mombasa from studying abroad and people that knew me from High School noticed my eyesight had declined much further. They would ask me many questions like how did you finish University? How do you cook? How do you clean? How do you go shopping? How do you travel? What do you do now for fun? I got exhausted answering everyone\u2019s questions individually because of constantly repeating myself, so I decided to put my film and theatre degree into use and start making YouTube videos showing people the ways in which I have adapted.\n\n4. You were part of the project behind MapAbility, a tool that has been created through the Open Institute, to assess how accessible the buildings in Nairobi are for everyone, especially for people with disabilities. How was it working on this project and what impact do you see as a result of it?\n\nMapability\u2019s bottom line was about universal design. It brought awareness to the general public, for the very first time in most cases, that being an inclusive society doesn\u2019t just mean building a ramp at a door, and more importantly, it isn\u2019t only useful to PWDs. The disabled community is the biggest minority group in the world.\n\nApproximately 15% of the global population identify with some kind of disability. This implies people with less \u2018traditional\u2019 disabilities would benefit from universally designed environments.\n\nFor example, if a pavement is built correctly and maintained regularly on par with global standards, it wouldn\u2019t just benefit a wheelchair user using that pavement. Children could use it and be safe, mothers with baby stroller too, people pulling their heavy trolley bags and suitcases, VIPs with their white Keynes who need to avoid obstacles, passengers getting on and off public transport at a bus stop; the elderly, people with injuries like a sprained ankle, so on and so forth.\n\nWhen governments prioritize universal design of its environments, every single person lives easier because of it, no matter their ability or disability. The work that we did resulted in a lot of civic engagement of people interested in a more inclusive society, acknowledgment from the Ministry of Social Protection and Labour, engineers, manufacturers, and designers applying this in their work, and a continued effort from private building owners and implementing long-term strategies to this effect.\n\n5. We asked Crystal what values are most important to her that she lives by.\n\nI. Empathy. Always remember that the other person could be you. When you can remember that your loved one, your neighbour, a work colleague, the shopkeeper, the courier guy, your doctor, the kids in your apartment building aren\u2019t so different to you at all, then you remember that they are searching for love, respect, belonging, significance, growth, adventure and a sense of certainty just like you are.\n\nRemembering this helps me move through the world with more compassion, kindness and understanding even when people may not extend the same to me in that moment.\n\nII. True-to-Self; Another value is remembering who I am and not conforming. Because whenever I conform to please another, I am enabling that person to believe that I am willing to put their happiness over my own. Whenever we choose \u2018fitting in\u2019 over belonging to ourselves, it disempowers us. That is a deep pain to bear.\n\n6. So how do you describe yourself, and how do others describe you?\n\nI am a dreamer, a student of life, a powerful creator who also enjoys laughing, feeling good, peace, and simplicity. I think I came here with this mountain so that I can show others that it can be moved. As of how others describe me, that is less of my business really. Whatever they say is alright regardless.\n\n7. Talk to us about your little tribe known as patreon.\n\nBeing an independent female artist with a disability in Africa isn\u2019t easy, if Who I am and what I stand for resonates, I would love you to join my little tribe over on www.patreon.com/crystalasige.\n\nPatreon is used by creatives like myself to build a community of supporters who really believe in their favourite artists\u2019 craft, and want to get behind them moving from strength to strength! Think of it as you contributing to my \u201csuccess kitty jar\u201d every month with whatever you can, allowing me to remain creatively independent and financially sustained, making it easier on me to give you even more great music and edu-tainment. The direct support helps artists like myself to continue creating without constantly pinching pennies, or even worse giving up altogether for lack of resources, and instead helps us to focus on being of service through our art!\n\nNow, I am not suggesting that you frivolously add to your already long list of expenses, because this is obviously a tough time for us all. What I would like to give in return for joining my Patreon are some great benefits and exclusive content you wouldn\u2019t get anywhere else including access to a chat platform of superfans only, behind the scenes passes, monthly virtual calls with me where I will do all sorts to better connect with you on a personal level, special offers to Patreons only and more yummy perks in store. My wish is to make sure this is not just another transactional type of platform for you. I want it to be meaningful, inclusive, and just good old fun.", "articleBodyHtml": "<article>\n\n<p>In our segment of #KenyaWomenSeries, we feature, Crystal Asige.\u00a0\u00a0A lady who after years of trying to figure out her place in the world, finally found her niche which presently reads: An award-winning Artist, Amnesty International Kenya Board member, visual arts trained disability and inclusion champion, YouTuber and public speaker who happens to be blind.</p>\n\n<p>It is hard to miss Crystal Asige\u2019s great sense of humour.
