Even though the party was a success on Vera\u2019s side, it wasn\u2019t on the service providers\u2019 side.\n\nThe comedian was not enlisted to perform but to provide Vera with the sound system. He was however forced to unleash his angst expressed his rage on Instagram, claiming he hasn\u2019t received the Sh5K balance. He could let the issue slide, but his team was mishandled during the event.\n\n\u201cFor some of us, it\u2019s the \u2018small money that makes a difference in our livelihoods. I\u2019m kindly asking you to pay me my balance of 5,000/= Which rightfully belongs to me! \u2026\n\nUpon finishing my end of the bargain which was at 9 Pm I asked for my balance only for her to now assume she doesn\u2019t know who we are and instead sent a team of bouncers/Security, A group of her already drunk Lady friends, and some guy by the name Victor to whisk us away making all sorts of insults at us\u2026\n\nVERA Trust me, I\u2019d let the 5k slide but it\u2019s the disrespect that you showed me and my team last night that makes me do this. Imagine leaving the venue at 1 am past curfew hours, Makarau ndio hao na sisi. To cut the long story short even the 10k you paid me ended up going down the drain. Now I\u2019m in arrears coz now my team also are demanding payment from me.

He is free to drive it home. But the reality of winning a Renault Kwid, off of a nine-match betting slip courtesy of Mozzart Bet \u2019s Omoka na Moti Promotion is yet to sink in for Duncan Lumumba.\n\nRenault describes the car as an enhanced SUV-inspired design with details and next-gen technology. Bolder, more stylish and well-equipped than ever before. New signature lighting, a stylish grille and bigger muscular multi-spoke wheels elevate its imposing stance and Lumumba is set to drive his way to car ownership in the said model.\n\nOn a normal-looking Tuesday 7 December morning, the 26-year old barber got up to his normal routine of tending to his clientele at the \u2018Black Shade\u2019 barbershop at the heart of Naivasha town, but first a quick trip to the Mozzart Bet portal to place his daily Ksh 50 bet.\n\nMaybe he forgot about his bet as he went about his day, or not. But Lumumba went to sleep as usual but was rudely interrupted by his messaging tone from deep sleep on the wee hours of Wednesday morning.\n\n\u201cAt 3 am the message came in and my phone message tone is so loud, given the nature of my job, it woke me up. My Tuesday bet slip had won me Ksh 145,577. I never went back to sleep after that. The highest amount I had previously won from my six months of betting through Mozzart Bet is Ksh 15,000. You can imagine my excitement, thinking of how this windfall was going to change my life,\u201d narrates Lumumba.\n\nArmed with a loaded pocket, the second born in a family of four embarked on a journey to Nairobi on Wednesday 8 December as he had a pre-arranged meeting with his youngest brother who is getting settled ready to join college. But the not-so-rude interruptions kept flowing.\n\n\u201cI was to spend the day helping him get settled in then get back to Naivasha. I received a call from the MozzartBet office informing me that I was the winner of a car. I could not believe it. I shared the news with my brother and he too was sceptical. A meeting was set for Thursday at the leading betting firm\u2019s main office and it wasn\u2019t until I got there that the feeling of someone playing a bad joke or a con game on me started fading away. I cannot thank MozzartBet enough. They have changed my life,\u201d said an elated Lumumba.\n\nAfter getting numerous assurances from the Mozzart Bet office that he was not being scammed and he actually is the seventh winner of the month-long promotion that he has diligently participated in since its launch, Lumumba is looking forward to expanding his barber business to include a salon and offer more services to his growing clientele.\n\n\u201cIt has always been my dream to own a big barbershop and incorporate a salon and that dream is coming true sooner than I expected. The bet slip payout will go towards that. As for the car, I am looking at doing business with it to supplement my barbershop income,\u201d he offered.\n\nMozzartbet have two promotions running concurrently: Urban Cruiser and Omoka na Moti with a combined value of Ksh50 million.\n\nUrban Cruiser Promotion\n\nThe Urban Cruiser Promotion is a one-off reward for a lucky punter who will have strung together the longest winning multi-bet by 19th December 2021.\n\nThe only conditions tied to Urban Cruiser Promotion is every entry in the bet slip must have 1.35 odds and above with a stake not less than Ksh50.\n\nSo far one punter has led the chase for this Urban Cruiser for over two weeks having mustered a 26-game winning ticket with the closest pursuer stuck on 24 games.\n\nOmoka na Moti Promotion\n\nOmoka na Moti Promotion on the other hand gives a car daily to one punter who conjures a winning ticket with the highest accumulation of odds each day. The only conditions attached to this promotion is a fifty bob stake or more for one to qualify.\n\nHow to participate in the Omoka Na Moti promotion\n\nPromotion duration: from 1.12.2021 (00:01 h) to 31.12.2021 (23:59 h)\nThe beginning of all sports events on the ticket must not be earlier than 00:01, December 1st, 2021. Otherwise, the ticket is not taken into account. I.e., it does not meet the conditions for participation in the promotion.\nAll bet slips must be from that promotional day.

I have been betting for a while but it did not hit me that there is a day I would own a car from only 50 bob. I will not stop at the car, I will continue betting because I know I can win more than that. Anyone can transform their 50 shillings to a car with Mozzartbet just like I did,\u201d an elated Airo said. Airo\n\n\u201cHe comes in the morning, picks the fixtures and goes to analyze then comes back later to stake. On Saturday, after staking he became a bit hesitant on his pick in the Westham and Chelsea game and even wanted to cancel the bet but time did not allow. He wanted to bet on Chelsea as opposed to Westham. On Sunday, he came to collect his winnings in the morning and I served him because I was the one at the main counter. At that time, we did not know that he was the winner for the previous day but later the main office called and notified us that the person we had paid was the winner for the day. We counterchecked the time stamp of when we had paid him against the CCTV image and started looking for him, luckily it was easy because there was someone around who knew him,\u201d Achieng narrated. Achieng\n\nKawangware Mozzartbet Shop manager Brian Kibichii congratulated Airo and urged punters to continue playing with Mozzartbet now that they had experienced the reality of the promotion in their own backyard.\n\n\u201cYou have seen that the promotion is very real and Simo will be walking away with a brand new Proton Saga. You could be the next one who walks away with this car or even the 9 million Kenya shillings house,\u201d Kibichii said. Brian Kibichii\n\nMozzartbet have two promotions running concurrently: Urban Cruiser and Omoka na Moti with a combined value of Ksh50 million.\n\nThe Urban Cruiser Promotion is a one-off reward for a lucky punter who will have strung together the longest winning multi-bet by 19th December 2021.\n\nThe only conditions tied to Urban Cruiser Promotion is every entry in the bet slip must have 1.35 odds and above with a stake not less than Ksh50.\n\nSo far one punter has led the chase for this Urban Cruiser for over two weeks having mustered a 26-game winning ticket with the closest pursuer stuck on 24 games.\n\nOmoka na Moti Promotion on the other hand gives a car daily to one punter who conjures a winning ticket with the highest accumulation of odds each day. The only conditions attached to this promotion is a fifty bob stake or more for one to qualify.\n\nPromotion duration: from 1.12.2021 (00:01 h) to 31.12.2021 (23:59 h)\nThe beginning of all sports events on the ticket must not be earlier than 00:01, December 1st, 2021. Otherwise, the ticket is not taken into account. I.e., it does not meet the conditions for participation in the promotion.\nAll bet slips must be from that promotional day.

At that time, we did not know that he was the winner for the previous day but later the main office called and notified us that the person we had paid was the winner for the day.

Most of the officers who spoke to The Standard said he was a \u201cquiet man, whose mind you couldn\u2019t easily read.\u201d\n\nThe officers told of an incident in September when Imbatu and Carol got into an argument that saw him pull out her hair. Carol reported the incident at the station, but the matter was sorted out of court and the two reconciled.\n\nPolice believe that Imbatu\u2019s range was triggered by the suspicion that Carol was cheating on him. They began dating in September when Imbatu met Carol, who worked at his favourite drinking joint.\n\nHe won her heart and she moved in with him at an apartment in Kangemi, where he had moved on November 12.\n\nAs their love blossomed, Imbatu opened a bar for Carol. Then mistrust set in with claims that Carol was seeing a DJ. And while she reassured Imbatu of her commitment to him, but the police constable still harbored reservation.\n\n\u201cHe is the kind of man you couldn\u2019t understand. At times a small joke would turn ugly even with his colleagues,\u201d said an officer.\n\nThey also recalled an incident in 2018 when Imbatu is reported to have attacked and injured a man who was engaged in a dispute over rent with his landlord.\n\nImbatu confronted the rent defaulter and punched him so badly that he had to be rushed to the hospital.\n\nThe matter is said to have been reported to the Independent Policing Oversight Authority and is still under investigation.\n\nEye-witnesses claim that Imbatu stormed the bar he co-owned with Carol where he caused a commotion as he taunted customers with his gun.\n\nHe fired five bullets into the bar, destroying a TV set.\n\nThe owner of the building where Imbatu began his shooting spree said the policeman arrived home a few minutes past midnight in the company of Carol and another officer.\n\n\u201cHe dropped her at the apartment and thereafter took his colleague home. Several minutes later, he returned and demanded that he parks his vehicle inside the compound.\n\nThe night guards told him that the parking slots were fully occupied. He got angry and told the guards to \u2018create space for me inside, or else I shoot you dead.\u201d\n\n\u201cIt took a lot of convincing to make him park the car outside the compound,\u201d said the landlord, who requested anonymity.\n\n\u201cAfter parking his car, he stormed into the apartment. He was visibly angry. Minutes later, the guards said they heard a gunshot from one of the houses.

Most of the officers who spoke to The Standard said he was a \u201cquiet man, whose mind you couldn\u2019t easily read.\u201d</p>\n\n<p>The officers told of an incident in September when Imbatu and Carol got into an argument that saw him pull out her hair. Carol reported the incident at the station, but the matter was sorted out of court and the two reconciled.</p>\n\n<p>Police believe that Imbatu\u2019s range was triggered by the suspicion that Carol was cheating on him. They began dating in\u00a0September when Imbatu met Carol, who worked at his favourite drinking joint.</p>\n\n<p>He won her heart and she moved in with him at an apartment in Kangemi, where he had moved on November 12.</p>\n\n<p>As their love blossomed, Imbatu opened a bar for Carol. Then mistrust set in with claims that Carol was seeing a DJ. And while she reassured Imbatu of her commitment to him, but the police constable still harbored reservation.</p>\n\n<p>\u201cHe is the kind of man you couldn\u2019t understand. At times a small joke would turn ugly even with his colleagues,\u201d said an officer.</p>\n\n<p>They also recalled an incident in 2018 when Imbatu is reported to have attacked and injured a man who was engaged in a dispute over rent with his landlord.</p>\n\n<p>Imbatu confronted the rent defaulter and punched him so badly that he had to be rushed to the hospital.</p>\n\n<p>The matter is said to have been reported to the Independent Policing Oversight Authority and is still under investigation.</p>\n\n<p>Eye-witnesses claim that Imbatu stormed the bar he co-owned with Carol where he caused a commotion as he taunted customers with his gun.</p>\n\n<p>He fired five bullets into the bar, destroying a TV set.</p>\n\n<p>The owner of the building where Imbatu began his shooting spree said the policeman arrived home a few minutes past midnight in the company of Carol and another officer.</p>\n\n<p>\u201cHe dropped her at the apartment and thereafter took his colleague home. Several minutes later, he returned and demanded that he parks his vehicle inside the compound.</p>\n\n<p>The night guards told him that the parking slots were fully occupied. He got angry and told the guards to \u2018create space for me inside, or else I shoot you dead.\u201d</p>\n\n<p>\u201cIt took a lot of convincing to make him park the car outside the compound,\u201d said the landlord, who requested anonymity.</p>\n\n<p>\u201cAfter parking his car, he stormed into the apartment. He was visibly angry. Minutes later, the guards said they heard a gunshot from one of the houses. Upon rushing to the scene, they found a fire had started engulfing Imbatu\u2019s house and the body of his girlfriend was on the floor.\u201d</p>\n\n<p>Imbatu had already left the house.</p>\n\n<p>The gunshot had attracted boda boda riders to the scene.
