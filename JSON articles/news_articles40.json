testing for Covid-19.", "articleBody": "More by this Author\n\nRwanda has tightened rules on gatherings, including a ban on night clubs, after health officials recorded six cases of the highly transmissible Covid variant, Omicron.\n\nAccording to the Ministry of Health, the cases were confirmed through genomic sequencing of samples collected from travellers and their contacts.\n\nRestrictions\n\nA Cabinet meeting chaired by President Paul Kagame Tuesday revised virus rules, imposing restrictions on crowds, and calling for vaccination and regular testing as part of efforts to slow transmission of the new variant ahead of the end year festive season.\n\nThe new virus preventive measures, which come into effect starting December 16, will remain in place for one month but may be reviewed at any time.\n\nIn particular, the Cabinet suspended all night clubs as well as live band entertainment in other venues, while organised concerts will be subjected to approval on case by case basis by relevant government officials.\n\nRecreational and entertainment venues, like other events and gatherings such as concerts, exhibitions and festivals, had earlier been reopened for vaccinated and tested participants at 50 per cent of venue capacity.\n\nPublic and private sector offices, which had recalled workers and were operating at 75 per cent and full capacity, respectively, have been urged to operate at no more than 30 per cent and 50 per cent capacity, respectively.\n\nAll arriving passengers must quarantine for three days at designated hotels for three days with a PCR test taken on arrival, and additional test taken on day three and on day seven at own cost.\n\nRestrictions have been imposed on other events such as parties in homes, weddings and burial ceremonies all of which will be attended by restricted number of people with proof of negative Covid-19 test and full vaccination, as well as seeking authorisation in the latter case.\n\n\u201cThe new Covid-19 preventive measures announced by Cabinet are intended to contain the spread of Omicron. The variant has shown to spread rapidly,\u201d Health Minister Daniel Ngamije said in an announcement released Tuesday.\n\nVaccine\n\nThe ministry urged citizens and residents aged 12 and older to get fully vaccinated.

after health officials recorded six cases of the highly transmissible Covid variant,\u00a0Omicron.</p>\n\n<p>According to the Ministry of Health, the cases were confirmed through genomic sequencing of samples collected from travellers and their contacts.</p>\n\n<h2>Restrictions</h2>\n\n<p>A Cabinet meeting chaired by President Paul Kagame Tuesday revised virus rules, imposing restrictions on crowds, and calling for vaccination and regular testing as part of efforts to slow transmission of the new variant ahead of the end year festive season.</p>\n\n<p>The new virus preventive measures, which come into effect starting December 16, will remain in place for one month but may be reviewed at any time.</p>\n\n<p>In particular, the Cabinet suspended all night clubs as well as live band entertainment in other venues, while organised concerts will be subjected to approval on case by case basis by relevant government officials.</p>\n\n<p>Recreational and entertainment venues, like other events and gatherings such as concerts, exhibitions and festivals, had earlier been reopened for vaccinated and tested participants at 50 per cent of venue capacity.</p>\n\n<p>Public and private sector offices, which had recalled workers and were operating at 75 per cent and full capacity, respectively, have been urged to operate at no more than 30 per cent and 50 per cent capacity, respectively.</p>\n\n<p>All arriving passengers must quarantine for three days at designated hotels for three days with a PCR test taken on arrival, and additional test taken on day three and on day seven at own cost.</p>\n\n<p>Restrictions have been imposed on other events such as parties in homes, weddings and burial ceremonies all of which will be attended by restricted number of people with proof of negative Covid-19 test and full vaccination, as well as seeking authorisation in the latter case.</p>\n\n<p>\u201cThe new Covid-19 preventive measures announced by Cabinet are intended to contain the spread of Omicron. The variant has shown to spread rapidly,\u201d Health Minister Daniel Ngamije said in an announcement released Tuesday.</p>\n\n<h2>Vaccine</h2>\n\n<p>The ministry urged citizens and residents aged 12 and older to get fully vaccinated. It also encouraged all adults who received their full dose at least six months ago to get booster doses, especially those aged 50 and above and those with underlying health conditions.</p>\n\n<p>More than 4.2 million people in the country were fully vaccinated, while another 6.9 million had received the first dose of the Covid jab as at December 14, Health ministry data indicates.

to more rural and country side locations.</p>\n\n<p>Real estate consultancy Knight Frank in its latest Global Survey 2021 indicates that majority of people are now keen to move to spacious and more eco-friendly homes.</p>\n\n<p>The Knight Frank survey reveals a desire amongst African respondents for green homes and the suburbs.</p>\n\n<p>\u201cThe pandemic has fueled aspirations for bigger homes, both in the Africa, Middle East and in other parts of the world,\u201d said Faisal Durrani, a partner at Knight Frank and Head of Middle East Research.</p>\n\n<p>The survey indicates that about a third of all buyers interviewed said they are now more likely to buy a second home as a safe haven from the pandemic if restrictions return, up from 26 percent last year.</p>\n\n<p>Of those looking to buy a second home, 23 percent say the pandemic has influenced where they want to buy and 22 percent say it has delayed their purchase plans.</p>\n\n<p>\u2018\u2018The pandemic has induced buyers to reassess their buyer preferences and this is driving some fascinating changes in home buyers\u2019 attitudes,\u2019\u2019 said Durrani.</p>\n\n<p>Climate concerns</p>\n\n<p>The Global Buyer Survey that was conducted among over 900 Knight Frank clients across more than 40 countries showed that good air quality, proximity to green space and access to good healthcare were unsurprisingly ranked the most important location features to home buyers.</p>\n\n<p>Senior analyst at Knight Frank Tilda Mwai said the new findings send a strong signal to developers.</p>\n\n<p>\u201cThe just concluded November Climate Change Conference (COP 26) in Glasgow, has helped to cement the growing importance of sustainable led residential developments. This survey provides us with a timely glimpse on how investors and buyers are zeroing in on the sustainability agenda across Africa,\u201d said Mr Mwai.</p>\n\n<p>The report also indicated that remote working influenced the choice of a home. A home office, access to broadband internet and outdoor space topped the list of the most preferred property feat.</p>\n\n</article>", "canonicalUrl": "https://www.theeastafrican.co.ke/tea/business/buyers-now-opting-for-green-homes-suburbs-3652308"},{"url": "https://www.theeastafrican.co.ke/tea/oped/comment/we-lost-chance-to-clear-menace-on-kampala-roads-3652800", "probability": 0.9752567, "headline": "We lost chance to clear boda, taxi, VIP menace on Kampala roads", "datePublished": "2021-12-14T14:00:00+00:00", "datePublishedRaw": "2021-12-14T14:00:00Z", "dateModified": "2021-12-14T15:01:27+00:00", "dateModifiedRaw": "2021-12-14T15:01:27Z", "author": "JOACHIM BUWEMBO", "authorsList": ["JOACHIM BUWEMBO"], "inLanguage": "en", "breadcrumbs": [{"name": "Home", "link": "https://www.theeastafrican.co.ke/tea"}, {"name": "Opinion", "link": "https://www.theeastafrican.co.ke/tea/oped"}, {"name": "Comment", "link": "https://www.theeastafrican.co.ke/tea/oped/comment"}], "mainImage": "https://www.theeastafrican.co.ke/resource/blob/3652816/2bd95fab78da85d1bd0794a85a4ec902/road-data.jpg", "description": "\nThe season of empty roads, which happened the Covid lockdowns, should have been used to fix the traffic system.

More than any other continental institution, Afriexim Bank has poured massive sums into personal protective equipment (PPE) and Covid-19 vaccines.\n\nOpposite the Africa Trade House, a little worse for wear, is Cedi House, a 14-storey building that houses the Bank of Ghana and the Ghana Stock Exchange. Next to Cedi House is another of new age complexes, home to South African giant First National Bank (FNB) and other financial institutions. Then, directly across the road from FNB, is the well-appointed National Theatre.\n\nIt is the perfect setting to beg the question; if you had to take a play across the road to the stage at the National Theatre about the dream of a pan-African market and the possibilities for the money people to make a fortune, what story would you tell?\n\nAfCFTA aims to create the largest free trade area in the world measured by the number of countries participating, bringing 1.4 billion people across with a combined gross domestic product (GDP) valued at S$3.4 trillion into one pot.\n\nThe story one could bring to the National Theatre might draw from scenes at the flank of Africa Trade House at the edge of Independence Avenue.\n\nIt\u2019s an oddity, but there in this upmarket part of the city, is a thriving street second-hand clothes (mitumba) market. The mitumba would star in the play with the second-hand cars, that other fixture of the modern African consumer economy, that always seem to be stuck in the traffic jam next to the street market.\n\nIn 2019 Ghana was among the top importers of second-hand clothes in the world, and the leaders in sub-Saharan Africa, chalking up mitumba worth $168 million, with Kenya a close second, putting down $165 million. Mitumba is a complicated business. That year the otherwise fabulously cash-rich United Arab Emirates spent $151 million. This tells you that the rich buy a lot of mitumba for re-export. For $168 million, Ghana likely resell some of it around West Africa.\n\nExact figures are elusive, but annually Africa imports over $1 billion of mitumba. We have a better handle on the figures for second-hand cars.

More than any other continental institution, Afriexim Bank has poured massive sums into personal protective equipment (PPE) and Covid-19 vaccines.</p>\n\n<p>Opposite the Africa Trade House, a little worse for wear, is Cedi House, a 14-storey building that houses the Bank of Ghana and the Ghana Stock Exchange. Next to Cedi House is another of new age complexes, home to South African giant First National Bank (FNB) and other financial institutions. Then, directly across the road from FNB, is the well-appointed National Theatre.</p>\n\n<p>It is the perfect setting to beg the question; if you had to take a play across the road to the stage at the National Theatre about the dream of a pan-African market and the possibilities for the money people to make a fortune, what story would you tell?</p>\n\n<p>AfCFTA aims to create the largest free trade area in the world measured by the number of countries participating, bringing 1.4 billion people across with a combined gross domestic product (GDP) valued at S$3.4 trillion into one pot.</p>\n\n<p>The story one could bring to the National Theatre might draw from scenes at the flank of Africa Trade House at the edge of Independence Avenue.</p>\n\n<p>It\u2019s an oddity, but there in this upmarket part of the city, is a thriving street second-hand clothes (mitumba) market. The mitumba would star in the play with the second-hand cars, that other fixture of the modern African consumer economy, that always seem to be stuck in the traffic jam next to the street market.</p>\n\n<p>In 2019 Ghana was among the top importers of second-hand clothes in the world, and the leaders in sub-Saharan Africa, chalking up mitumba worth $168 million, with Kenya a close second, putting down $165 million. Mitumba is a complicated business. That year the otherwise fabulously cash-rich United Arab Emirates spent $151 million. This tells you that the rich buy a lot of mitumba for re-export. For $168 million, Ghana likely resell some of it around West Africa.</p>\n\n<p>Exact figures are elusive, but annually Africa imports over $1 billion of mitumba. We have a better handle on the figures for second-hand cars. Speaking at the Intra-Africa Trade Fair in Durban, late November, South Africa\u2019s minister of Trade Industry and Competition Ebrahim Patel referenced the figure of four million used cars imported into Africa annually.</p>\n\n<p>He argued that between 20 and 25 new vehicle assembly plants could be established in Africa if it was able to convert those four million mitumba vehicles into new vehicle demand.</p>\n\n<p>That would be even more economical if the common free market AfCFTA is hoped to deliver worked.

No deaths have yet been associated with the variant.\n\nRyan stressed the need for all countries to help detect Omicron cases and research its behaviour.\n\n\"The more and better data we collect in the next two weeks, (the better chances) of a clear conclusion regarding the implications of this variant,\" he said.\n\nAs European Union health ministers met Tuesday to find ways to coordinate their response, Norway announced it will tighten restrictions to combat its surge.\n\nA suspected outbreak of Omicron last week among dozens of partygoers who had all been vaccinated led to new restrictions in and around the capital Oslo.\n\nNeighbouring Sweden also said Tuesday it would launch a series of anti-Covid measures.\n\nElsewhere in Europe, Poland said that from December 15, it will restrict the number of people allowed in churches, restaurants and theatres, and make vaccination compulsory for healthcare workers, teachers and the military from March 1.\n\nGrowing frustration\n\nWhile the positive initial assessments of Omicron helped lift the mood, especially among global markets as fears of another economic downturn subsided, the variant's emergence has highlighted that the fight against the pandemic is far from over.\n\nCovid-19 has officially killed more than 5.2 million people around the world since it was first declared in late 2019, although the true toll is likely to be several times higher.\n\nScientists and health experts say vaccinations and continued social distancing remain key to defeating all variants of the virus, including Omicron.\n\n\"The virus hasn't changed its nature,\" Ryan said. \"The rules of the game are still the same.\"\n\nBut vaccine requirements have sparked resistance in many countries, either because of misinformation and conspiracy theories or the economic and logistical impact of such mandates.\n\nAround 4,000 people protested in Brussels on Tuesday against a plan by the Belgian government to make vaccines compulsory for health workers from early next year.\n\n\"We are in favour of vaccination, but why only health workers?\" said nurse Perrine.", "articleBodyHtml": "<article>\n\n<figure><img

Key among them was the lack of a central regulatory body to streamline and expedite approval processes. Also lacking are high-performing national regulatory authorities to govern local vaccine manufacturing.\n\nThe companies that include Pfizer, Johnson&Johnson, Moderna and BioNTech said there was a need for a \u201crobust regulatory environment, security and talent to encourage increased investments into manufacturing on the continent.\u201d\n\nExperts meeting at the Partnership for African Vaccine Manufacturing conference in Kigali last week said the pandemic had shown Africa urgently needed to tackle its dependence on imported vaccines.

I open one door at the end of the dimly-lit narrow corridor to be greeted by a young woman blowing a French horn and a man at the cello.\n\nIn the background, seen through the glass window, is Dandora, a slum that has people and marabou storks scavenging through a mountain of garbage, as large yellow cranes pile more on.\n\nIt\u2019s an unlikely scene \u2014 the slum and the classical musicians, this is home of Ghetto Classics.\n\nThe two youngsters are oblivious to the acrid smell and the smoke from the dumpsite, their concentration absolute. This is where they come to play music and have dreams to escape the grinding poverty that they are born into.\n\n\u201cThe only thing you need when you come to Ghetto Classics,\u201d says Cyndia Kabei, the 20-year-old girl with the French horn, \u201cis a passion for music.\u201d\n\nAnd a dedication to practice, practice, practice.\n\nPersistence pays\n\nBorn in Korogocho slum that neighbours Dandora, Cyndia (short for Cyndicate as she says with a smile) heard about Ghetto Classics from friends at school. \u201cI used to sing in church and, in 2017, I joined Ghetto Classics.\u201d\n\nLike every newcomer to Ghetto Classics, the first three months are spent playing the recorder.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s to check your persistence,\u201d says Cyndia.\n\nAnd then you are given the instrument of your choice if you make it through. For her, it was the French horn. \u201cI found it unique and felt challenged. Not many play it, and no girls in the group. It\u2019s really tough, but l researched on the internet about it. I love it.\u201d\n\nDressed in blue jeans and a T-shirt, the young girl has grit. \u201cMy mum sells vegetables on the pavement and my dad works as a painter in the informal sector. He is really hard working, but he has no work at the moment.\n\n\u201cGrowing up is not easy in Korogocho, but you look for things to keep you moving, to spice up your life, like music.\u201d\n\nIn 2018, Cyndia auditioned for the Safaricom Youth Orchestra and passed. In 2021, she finished high school, but then the coronavirus pandemic hit.\n\n\u201cInstead of just sitting at home, I started a band with Lameck, the violinist, in 2021. We call it the Dhamani Band, which has grown from four to 10 members.\u201d\n\nWith four guitarists, three singers, a keyboard and a saxophone player, specialises in African zouk music from the Caribbean islands.\n\nCyndia\u2019s dream is to make a better life for her parents and three siblings.\n\nConcert practice\n\nI open another door with the most vibrant sounds. There\u2019s a man on the piano and musicians accompanying him with a violin, cello and a flute. The rich voice of a woman carries through. The group is practicing for The Best of Ghetto Classics, a concert directed by Levi Wataka and Michael James.\n\nOn December 7, Ghetto Classics will hold a concert at the MatBronze Caf\u00e9 in Nairobi.\n\nThe singer is Elizabeth Njoroge, the founder of Art of Music Foundation, which teaches music to more than 500 children in Korogocho.\n\nThe foundation has satellite projects across the country. It uses music for social change, teaching children to play instruments, keeping them in school, providing mentorship, and offering food and a shelter to the most vulnerable. Ghetto Classics is a product of the Foundation.\n\nNjoroge started the project with a parish priest at a community centre run by the Catholic Church 12 years ago.\n\nShe later met Edita Camm, who has staged operas in Nairobi and, after her eighth, was set to retire.\n\n\u201cIn October 2019, I showed my last opera. It was a short opera by Mennotti, before the Covid pandemic,\u201d says Camm.\n\nBut she soon realised that the musicians she had worked with were suffering, their income depleted because of the lockdown.\n\n\u201cTheir plight moved me to organise a concert as soon as the lockdown was lifted,\u201d said Camm.\n\nWhen a friend played her a recording of David Mwenje of Ghetto Classics singing Bring Him Home, from the musical Les Miserables, Camm reached out to Njoroge.\n\n\u201cIt was an impressive rendition; more so considering that Mwenje has had limited training in music by Ghetto Classics.\n\n\u201cThe concert has three professional musicians to accompany those from Ghetto Classics. They are the pianist Bennaars Ongidi, the violinist David Ralak and the super soprano Elizabeth Njoroge,\u201d said Camm.\n\nYoung performers\n\nBetween rehearsals I chat with the musicians, soon to perform in their uniform of black suits.\n\nMwenje sings tenor. \u201cI loved singing in church,\u201d he says.\n\nAt school he was a prefect and made a deal with the noisemakers in class who played instruments. \u201cI told them l would not report them if they taught me music.\n\n\u201cThen one day l followed them and ended up at Saint John\u2019s and saw Ghetto Classics.\u201d\n\nThis was in 2016, the start of a new life for Mwenje. \u201cI\u2019m told l have a Vatican voice,\u201d he says with a grin. \u201cI think it\u2019s a gift from God.\u201d\n\nNjoroge introduced Mwenje to Sylvester Makobi, a Kenyan based in the US with the African American Arts Institute at the Indiana University of Bloomington. Makobi performed at former US president Barack Obama\u2019s inauguration in 2009. He introduced Mwenje to opera.\n\n\u201cMy dream is to be an opera singer, to help others who have talent but don\u2019t know that,\u201d Mwenje says.\n\nLameck Otieno, 20, is a violinist. Studying architecture at Jomo Kenyatta University of Agriculture and Technology, his dream is to transform Korogocho into a housing estate.\n\nAnd Stephen Kamau, at 21, began playing the violin, but found that he loved the cello more.\n\nIt\u2019s an unlikely scene \u2013 the slum and the classical musicians - but this is the home of Ghetto Classics.\n\nThe two youngsters are oblivious to the acrid smell and the smoke from the dumpsite, their concentration absolute.

For Cyndia, it was the French horn. \u201cI found it unique and felt challenged. Not many play it and no girls. It\u2019s really tough but l researched on the internet about it. I love it. I\u2019m going to play it for the rest of my life.\u201d\n\nDressed in blue jeans and a t-shirt, the pretty young girl has grit. \u201cMy mum sells vegetables on the pavement and my dad works as a painter in Jua Kali (informal sector dubbed under the hot sun). He is really hard working but he has no work at the moment.\u201d\n\nThe young woman looks out of the window facing the mountains of garbage with a far-away look.\n\n\u201cGrowing up is not easy in Korogocho but you look for things to keep you moving, to spice up your life, like music.\u201d\n\nKorogocho is a slum of mabati and mud houses reached through narrow muddy lanes where there is no running water or sanitation. The road off the Eastern Bypass via Kariobangi to Korogocho starts with high-rise brick buildings till the slum where nothing is wasted. Piled on the road are wares sifted from the dumpsite - anything from broken toys to electronic stuff. Crime is rife, prostitution a way of life for many.\n\nIn 2018, Cyndia auditioned for the Safaricom Youth Orchestra and passed. In 2021, she finished her O levels but then corona hit.\n\n\u201cInstead of just sitting at home, I started a band with Lameck the violinist in 2021. We call it the Dhamani Band, which has grown from four to 10.\u201d\n\nDhamani is the Swahili word for earth. The band which consists of four guitarists, three singers, one keyboard and one sax player, specializes in African zouk music, a popular dance music from the Caribbean islands with a history of African slavery in the French West Indies.\n\nCyndia\u2019s biggest dream is to take her parents and three siblings out of the slum.\n\nGhetto Classics \u2013 the Start\n\nI open the door with the most vibrant sounds. There\u2019s a man on the piano and a cluster of musicians accompanying him with a violin, cello and a flute. The rich voice of a woman carries through. The group is practicing for \u2018The Best of Ghetto Classics\u2019, a concert by the most talented musicians of Ghetto Classics directed by Levi Wataka and Michael James. In a few days they will hold a concert at the upscale MatBronze Caf\u00e9 in Langata.\n\nThe woman singing is Elizabeth Njoroge, founder of Art of Music Foundation which teaches music to over 500 children in Korogocho, with other satellite projects spread across the country.\n\nThe Foundation uses music for social change, teaching children from unstable backgrounds to play instruments as well as keeping them in school, providing mentorship, and offering food and a shelter to the most vulnerable. Ghetto Classics is a product of the Foundation.\n\nNjoroge started the project with the parish priest at a community center run by the Catholic Church 12 years ago.\n\nIt\u2019s a challenging place with kids from the slum in addition to getting the instruments, the child, and the teacher in the same place at the same time.\n\nIn the course of her love for classical music, Njoroge met Edita Camm, an orchestra buff cum manager who has staged many operas in Nairobi and after her eight, was set to retire.\n\n\u201cIn October 2019, I showed my last Opera. It was a short opera by Mennotti before the covid pandemic,\u201d tells the petite Camm.\n\nBut she soon realized that the musicians she had worked with were suffering, their income down to zero for two years because of the lockdown with the clubs and theatres closed.\n\n\u201cTheir plight moved me to organize a concert as soon as the lockdown was lifted,\u201d continues Camm. But instead of organizing full scale operas which take a year to prepare and rehearse, Camm began to produce concerts.\n\nWhen a friend played her a recording of David Mwenje of Ghetto Classics singing \u2018Bring him home\u2019 from the musical Les Miserable, Camm reached out to Njoroge.\n\n\u201cIt was an impressive rendition; more so considering that David comes from Korogocho slum and has had limited training in music by the marvelous institution Ghetto Classics.\n\n\u201cI was moved and such talent without a wider audience is wasted.\u201d\n\nIt\u2019s the story of the concert \u2018The Best of Ghetto Classics\u2019.\n\n\u201cThe concert has three professional musicians to accompany the musicians from Ghetto Classics. They are the pianist Bennaars Ongidi, the violinist David Ralak and the founder of Ghetto Classic - the super soprano Elizabeth Njoroge,\u201d tells Camm\n\nIn Conversation with the Best of Ghetto Classics\n\nBetween rehearsals l chat with the millennial musicians all born in the slum, soon to perform in black suits and polished shoes.\n\nDavid Mwenje sings tenor. \u201cI loved singing in church,\u201d he tells. At school he was a prefect and made a deal with the noise makers in class who played instruments. \u201cI told them l would not report them if they taught me music.\n\n\u201cThen one day l followed them and ended up at Saint John\u2019s and saw Ghetto Classics.\u201d This was in 2016, the start of a new life for Mwenje. \u201cI\u2019m told l have a Vatican voice,\u201d he says with a grin. \u201cI think it\u2019s a gift from God.\u201d\n\nNjoroge introduced Mwenje to Sylvester Makobi, from Kenya now based in U.S. with the African American Arts Institute at the Indiana University of Bloomington. In an impressive resume, Makobi has also performed at Barack Obama\u2019s inauguration in 2009. Holding zoom classes, Makobi introduced Mwenje to opera. \u201cI didn\u2019t even know what opera was,\u201d says the vocalist.\n\n\u201cMy dream is to be an opera singer, to help others who have talent but don\u2019t know that.\u201d\n\nOne of the eight kids, he\u2019s lost four siblings\u2026some shot in gang rivalry, theft or drugs. At 20, he\u2019s helping his mother, a vegetable seller to raise the rest in a single room.\n\nLameck Otieno at 20 is a violist. One of the nine siblings, his mother is a \u2018mama mboga\u2019. Studying architecture at Jogo Kenyatta University of Agriculture and Technology, his dream is to transform Korogocho into a healthy housing estate with homes for pregnant girls, hospitals and schools to keep the kids out of the dumpsite.\n\nAs a seven-year old, Otieno foraged for food in the dumpsite, found his toys there until someone put him in the slum school. He enrolled with the church, sang and in 2014 heard Ghetto Classics performing in the amphitheatre at Saint John\u2019s. He\u2019s performed for the Pope and the President (Uhuru) but still returns home to the slum every night.\n\nStephen Kamau at 21 began playing the violin but found his love for the cello, which he\u2019d never seen till his foray at Ghetto Classics. His favourite musician is Yo-Yo Ma the American cellist and child prodigy, performing as a soloist with orchestras around the world. Ma is one of Time magazine's 100 Most Influential People of 2020.\n\nThe Best of Ghetto Classics was at Matbronze Caf\u00e9 at 6 p.m on 7th December.", "articleBodyHtml": "<article>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://www.theeastafrican.co.ke/tea/author-profiles/rupi-mangat-1371438\">More by this Author</a></p>\n\n<p>The sound of music fills my ears, from several rooms behind closed doors.

Studying architecture at Jogo Kenyatta University of Agriculture and Technology, his dream is to transform Korogocho into a healthy housing estate with homes for pregnant girls, hospitals and schools to keep the kids out of the dumpsite.</p>\n\n<p>As a seven-year old, Otieno foraged for food in the dumpsite, found his toys there until someone put him in the slum school. He enrolled with the church, sang and in 2014 heard Ghetto Classics performing in the amphitheatre at Saint John\u2019s. He\u2019s performed for the Pope and the President (Uhuru) but still returns home to the slum every night.</p>\n\n<p>Stephen Kamau at 21 began playing the violin but found his love for the cello, which he\u2019d never seen till his foray at Ghetto Classics. His favourite musician is Yo-Yo Ma the American cellist and child prodigy, performing as a soloist with orchestras around the world. Ma is one of Time magazine's 100 Most Influential People of 2020.</p>\n\n<p>The Best of Ghetto Classics was at Matbronze Caf\u00e9 at 6 p.m on 7th December.</p>\n\n</article>", "canonicalUrl":

Zanzibar for the first time represented.\n\nThe 11 th EAC Inter-Parliamentary Games are taking place in Arusha, Tanzania.\n\nWhile addressing the participants of the Inter-Parliamentary games, East African Legislative Assembly Speaker Martin Ngoga said the decision to allow Zanzibar to participate followed consultations with EAC member states.\n\n\u201cWe first consulted with member states and they all agreed that Zanzibar should also participate and remember even in CECAFA Zanzibar participates as well,\u201d he said.\n\nZanzibar hailed the EAC member states\u2019 decision.\n\n\u201cWe would like to thanks EAC member states for allowing us to participate in these games and we call on the EALA speaker to always invite us whenever possible,\u201d said Hamza Hassan Juma, the chairperson of sports for Zanzibar House of Representatives.\n\nThe Games was officially opened by Tanzania\u2019s Prime Minister Kassim Majaliwa under the theme \u201cStrengthening Integration through Inter- Parliamentary Games in the Covid-19 era\".\n\nHe said the government will have a vaccination booth near the playground for anyone wishing to get vaccinated.\n\n\u201cThe government will provide vaccination of any type for those who wish to and a centre will be available near the playgrounds.\n\n\u201cWe have seen now the Covid-19 variant so we are going to make sure whoever feels like he needs to be vaccinated can do it because Tanzania\u2019s target is to get 90 percent of our people vaccinated,\u201d Mr Majaliwa added.\n\nAccording to EALA, almost 1,500 participants from Uganda, Burundi, Kenya, Tanzania, and Zanzibar arrived in Arusha for the Inter-Parliamentary Games. Participants from South Sudan were expected to arrive on Tuesday.\n\nThe Inter-Parliamentary Games (IPG) are coordinated by the EALA on an annual basis. The IPG plays a fundamental role in enabling EALA's interaction with members of the national parliaments, staff and citizens of East Africa.\n\nThe IPG is expected to last 14 days with competitions lined up for football, netball, athletics, tug-of-war, volleyball, walking race, golf, basketball and darts.\n\n\u201cWe have come here to claim our position in East Africa and we are going to win all the games as we did in 2019,\u201d said Kenyan lawmaker Dan Wanyama.\n\nThree MPs and three staff members from each Parliament participated in the curtain raiser game.\n\nThe curtain raiser games saw a football match between the EAC select team staff thrashing EAC select members 4-0, while in netball the EAC select staff defeated EAC select members 24-7.\n\nThe objectives of the Inter-Parliamentary Games include sensitising members, staff and citizens from all partner states on the EAC integration process and progress.", "articleBodyHtml": "<article>\n\n<figure><img

must leverage trade pact to reduce poverty, cut inequality, and foster inclusive development.", "articleBody": "More by this Author\n\nThe African Continental Free Trade Area has opened a new chapter for the continent and rekindled hopes for recovery through trade in a post-Covid-19 world.\n\nAs nations continue to battle a pandemic that does not respect national borders, the $3.4 trillion borderless market created by the AfCFTA presents an opportunity to reduce Covid-19-induced growth contraction, poverty and inequality trends, and spur sustainable and inclusive growth on the continent.\n\nIntra-African trade is currently low at 14.4 per cent of total African exports. The United Nations Conference on Trade and Development (UNCTAD) estimates that the AfCFTA could boost intra-African trade by about 33 per cent and cut the continent\u2019s trade deficit by 51 per cent.\n\nEconomic growth\n\nBefore the pandemic hit, the continent had experienced rapid economic growth, but it was hardly inclusive \u2013 the gains were not distributed fairly across society. Economic growth can only be inclusive if it reduces both poverty and inequality.\n\nOur latest Economic Development in Africa Report 2021 shows that Africa\u2019s unprecedented growth in the 2000s has not translated to significantly improved livelihoods for most Africans, as the income gap between the rich and the poor has widened.\n\nAbout 34 per cent of African households live below the international poverty line ($1.9 per day), and around 40 per cent of the total wealth is owned by approximately 0.0001 per cent of the continent\u2019s population, according to the report. The pandemic has exacerbated inequalities and vulnerabilities of marginalised groups, resulting in an additional 37 million people in sub-Saharan Africa living in extreme poverty.\n\nA key question is how economic growth through regional integration can contribute to poverty reduction, cut inequality, and foster inclusive development, a main objective of the African Union\u2019s Agenda 2063.\n\nOur report shows that the continent\u2019s free trade area can deliver considerable inclusive economic growth for Africa\u2019s 1.3 billion people, but it needs measures to boost productivity and expand opportunities, as these gains will not come automatically.\n\nTrade policies alone are unlikely to support inclusive economic growth on the continent. Other required measures include cooperation in promoting investment and competition policies, accelerating financing of infrastructure that facilitates rural-urban linkages, and providing equal access to socioeconomic opportunities and productive resources.\n\nThe AfCFTA needs stronger support measures targeting women, who make up the largest share of informal traders, representing 70 per cent to 80 per cent in some countries, the youth, small businesses, and cross-border traders, as these groups have experienced a complete depletion of their savings due to pandemic-induced restrictions.\n\nInformal cross-border trade can account for up to 90 per cent of official trade flows in some countries and contribute to up to 40 per cent of total trade within regional economic communities such as the Southern African Development Community and the Common Market for Eastern and Southern Africa.\n\nUntapped $22 billion opportunity\n\nOur data show that the continent\u2019s current untapped export potential amounts to $21.9 billion, equivalent to 43 per cent of intra-African exports. An additional $9.2 billion of export potential can be realised through partial tariff liberalisation under the AfCFTA over the next five years.\n\nTo unlock the untapped potential, various intra-African non-tariff barriers, including costly non-tariff measures, infrastructure gaps, and market information gaps, need to be successfully addressed. This requires joint efforts under the AfCFTA.\n\nIn addition, long-term cooperation in investment and competition policies will be essential to overcoming market dominance by a few actors and to reducing structural and regulatory barriers to market entry.\n\nIntra-African trade comprises 61 per cent processed and semi-processed goods, suggesting higher potential benefits from greater regional trade for transformative and inclusive growth.\n\nUNCTAD\u2019s most recent Review of Maritime Transport 2021 shows that the AfCFTA could also boost maritime trade in Africa, as it\u2019s expected to raise demand for different modes of transport on the continent, which will in turn increase investment requirements for infrastructure and equipment \u2013 ports and vessels in the case of maritime transport.\n\nBut to fully realise the benefits of the AfCFTA, we must address the critical need to finance and develop adequate infrastructure and services in Africa to support maritime connectivity.\n\nPromise of regional value chains\n\nThe reconfiguration of global value chains amid the pandemic will have profound implications for inclusive and sustainable economic growth on the continent.\n\nThe pandemic is an inflection point in a shift towards a new more localised global economic geography with shorter, greener and more regional value chains, greater digitalisation and a lighter global production footprint.\n\nUnder the AfCFTA, the continent can develop and strengthen regional value chains and offer countries an opportunity to use regional advantages to boost competitiveness, diversify product supply, and export products with higher value added, helping cushion Africa from future economic shocks.\n\nGlobalisation trends are also being accompanied by a shift to more intangible, more digital, and more services-led value chains. African countries need therefore to look carefully at how they create and capture value from their engagement with each other and the wider world.\n\nThe AfCFTA\u2019s success will hinge on its ability to put in place simple, transparent, and predictable rules that can help create more viable region-wide value chains, closer to home across the African market.\n\nProspects are good for viable African value chains in industries like tea, cocoa-chocolate, cotton-apparel, beverage, cement, and automotive, as well as for creative, pharmaceutical, and other industries that offer paths towards economic diversification.\n\nChanging the game for industry\n\nThe continent\u2019s free trade area must be a game changer for pan-African industry. A focus on more intra-African trade in industrial goods promotes African industrialisation and the advancement of its manufacturing sector, providing more employment opportunities for the continent\u2019s booming youth population.\n\nAlso critical is enhanced pan-African collaboration in science, technology, and innovation, which will play a key role not only in post-Covid-19 recovery plans, but also in the decade of action to deliver on the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development.\n\nThe AfCFTA can also galvanise regional collaboration to tackle the scourge of illicit financial flows, which generate nearly $90 billion in lost financing from Africa every year, accounting for nearly half the Sustainable Development Goals investment gap in the region.", "articleBodyHtml": "<article>\n\n<figure><img src=\"data:image/png;base64,iVBORw0KGgoAAAANSUhEUgAAAAEAAAABCAQAAAC1HAwCAAAAC0lEQVR42mNkYAAAAAYAAjCB0C8AAAAASUVORK5CYII=\" alt=\"Rebeca Grynspan.\" title=\"\" data-cm-responsive-media='[{\"name\":\"landscape_ratio16x9\",\"ratioWidth\":16,\"ratioHeight\":9,\"linksForWidth\":{\"200\":\"/resource/image/3651508/landscape_ratio16x9/200/112/6c591885f9ddfa9315ffb8e87382a0d7/do/rebeca-grynspan.jpg\",\"300\":\"/resource/image/3651508/landscape_ratio16x9/300/168/6c591885f9ddfa9315ffb8e87382a0d7/UI/rebeca-grynspan.jpg\",\"400\":\"/resource/image/3651508/landscape_ratio16x9/400/225/6c591885f9ddfa9315ffb8e87382a0d7/xP/rebeca-grynspan.jpg\",\"1160\":\"/resource/image/3651508/landscape_ratio16x9/1160/652/6c591885f9ddfa9315ffb8e87382a0d7/JH/rebeca-grynspan.jpg\"}},{\"name\":\"portrait_ratio2x3\",\"ratioWidth\":2,\"ratioHeight\":3,\"linksForWidth\":{\"200\":\"/resource/image/3651508/portrait_ratio2x3/200/300/5d43658f1de94d1da865bd1b65e37bd3/oT/rebeca-grynspan.jpg\",\"400\":\"/resource/image/3651508/portrait_ratio2x3/400/600/5d43658f1de94d1da865bd1b65e37bd3/Ao/rebeca-grynspan.jpg\",\"768\":\"/resource/image/3651508/portrait_ratio2x3/768/1152/5d43658f1de94d1da865bd1b65e37bd3/cM/rebeca-grynspan.jpg\"}},{\"name\":\"landscape_ratio2x1\",\"ratioWidth\":2,\"ratioHeight\":1,\"linksForWidth\":{\"200\":\"/resource/image/3651508/landscape_ratio2x1/200/100/ae57f5975ff8783fee51cf76c1abe3d/Ej/rebeca-grynspan.jpg\"}},{\"name\":\"landscape_ratio3x2\",\"ratioWidth\":3,\"ratioHeight\":2,\"linksForWidth\":{\"300\":\"/resource/image/3651508/landscape_ratio3x2/300/200/dd6ed9086d45b373c2e23eae6c57db68/hp/rebeca-grynspan.jpg\",\"400\":\"/resource/image/3651508/landscape_ratio3x2/400/267/dd6ed9086d45b373c2e23eae6c57db68/CD/rebeca-grynspan.jpg\",\"768\":\"/resource/image/3651508/landscape_ratio3x2/768/512/dd6ed9086d45b373c2e23eae6c57db68/Od/rebeca-grynspan.jpg\"}},{\"name\":\"portrait_ratio1x1\",\"ratioWidth\":1,\"ratioHeight\":1,\"linksForWidth\":{\"50\":\"/resource/image/3651508/portrait_ratio1x1/50/50/b8493a22fae2a1e4c54ed555b6fa0301/yU/rebeca-grynspan.jpg\",\"60\":\"/resource/image/3651508/portrait_ratio1x1/60/60/b8493a22fae2a1e4c54ed555b6fa0301/ZJ/rebeca-grynspan.jpg\",\"200\":\"/resource/image/3651508/portrait_ratio1x1/200/200/b8493a22fae2a1e4c54ed555b6fa0301/sJ/rebeca-grynspan.jpg\",\"400\":\"/resource/image/3651508/portrait_ratio1x1/400/400/b8493a22fae2a1e4c54ed555b6fa0301/ff/rebeca-grynspan.jpg\",\"768\":\"/resource/image/3651508/portrait_ratio1x1/768/768/b8493a22fae2a1e4c54ed555b6fa0301/JY/rebeca-grynspan.jpg\"}},{\"name\":\"landscape_ratio4x3\",\"ratioWidth\":4,\"ratioHeight\":3,\"linksForWidth\":{\"200\":\"/resource/image/3651508/landscape_ratio4x3/200/150/5b4de0cf41105f04c217ae9826614d4d/ga/rebeca-grynspan.jpg\",\"400\":\"/resource/image/3651508/landscape_ratio4x3/400/300/5b4de0cf41105f04c217ae9826614d4d/cp/rebeca-grynspan.jpg\",\"768\":\"/resource/image/3651508/landscape_ratio4x3/768/576/5b4de0cf41105f04c217ae9826614d4d/Bl/rebeca-grynspan.jpg\"}}]'></figure>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://www.theeastafrican.co.ke/tea/author-profiles/rebeca-grynspan-3651480\">More by this Author</a></p>\n\n<p>The African Continental Free Trade Area has opened a new chapter for the continent and rekindled hopes for recovery through trade in a post-Covid-19 world.</p>\n\n<p>As nations continue to battle a pandemic that does not respect national borders, the $3.4 trillion borderless market created by the AfCFTA presents an opportunity to reduce Covid-19-induced growth contraction, poverty and inequality trends, and spur sustainable and inclusive growth on the continent.</p>\n\n<p>Intra-African trade is currently low at 14.4 per cent of total African exports.

It\u2019s a remarkable one, made all the more captivating and enriching by the men, women, and organisations that continue to share their ideas as we explore Africa\u2019s prospects in all its permutations.\n\nThe first Kusi Ideas Festival looked ahead to how the next 60 years would look like for the continent. We met in a relatively free environment, without the encumbrances of the life-changing Covid-19 pandemic.\n\nHowever, by the time of the second festival in Kisumu on the shores of Lake Victoria, the virus was already ruling the roost. Hence the theme, \u201cTowards a Post-Covid Africa\u201d.\n\nIn hindsight, and as evidenced by the unrelenting spread of the virus, we were overly presumptuous. The virus doesn\u2019t seem to be going away any time soon or at all. This is our new normal \u2013 of uncertainties and dread, but also opportunities.\n\nKusi III sets out to explore those opportunities anchored in the overarching theme of transformation within the constricting framework of the Covid-19 pandemic which, as at December 7, 2021, had killed 152,784 people with a cumulative case load of 6,294,435 across 47 countries, according to the World Health Organisation\u2019s Regional Office for Africa.

It\u2019s been tough and the challenges we have faced a year later have exposed the vulnerability of the continent as unable to control its own destiny. We can still do better,\u201d Dr Vito said.\n\nAstraZeneca has managed to offer two thirds of vaccines to third world countries, with 45 million doses distributed to Africa. The rest of the Mehta vaccines include those from Moderna, Johnson & Johnson, and others.\n\n\u201cWe started out well, but with the Indian ban on vaccine exports, the vaccination campaign not just in Africa but the rest of the developing world slowed down. However, in the last two months, we have delivered 17.5 million vaccines across Africa,\u201d she said.\n\nAccording to Africa CDC, under 10 per cent of the continent's population has been fully vaccinated, against a target of 40 per cent as per the World Health Organisation (WHO) recommendation. The low vaccination numbers have been attributed to vaccine access that disfavor the continent coupled with apathy driven by myths and fears.\n\n\u201cYes, we do have barriers as a continent. But we also have to appreciate the efforts made and so much more to ensure the vulnerable aren\u2019t exposed. As scientists, we can confirm that the latest variant is still within the containment of the testing, and vaccines available,\u201d Dr Vito said.\n\nShe added that \u201cWe need to see at least 40 per cent of the population vaccinated before we even think of booster shots. The booster conversation isn\u2019t something Africa should even have. Instead, the continent should focus its attention in getting as many adults as possible to be vaccinated.\u201d\n\nSpeaking at the panel discussion on the continent's vaccine acquisition, Dr John Mark Bwanika, the Director of Operations Rocket Health Africa, said that Covid has shown that Africa needs to move much faster than we were doing before.\n\n\u201cThe pandemic has given us a boost to improve our health infrastructure. We need to pick lessons from unique vaccination rollouts across Africa with model countries like Rwanda leaving a lot to be emulated. We have seen misunderstandings in the rollout that slowed down the process, but now the exercise is picking up,\u201c Dr Bwanika said, adding that despite the vaccines coming later than the continent needed them, Africa needs to do more to push up the numbers.\n\nCharles Abugre, a member of the programme advisory committee at Christian Aid, lamented the cost of vaccine acquisition for the continent, terming it as unsustainable.\n\n\u201cWe are paying far more for the vaccines than the rich countries. At $10 a dose, that\u2019s too much for the continent to bear. This is despite the huge public costs that went into the vaccines,\u201d Mr Abugre said.\n\nHe added; \u201cWe recognise the need for the vaccine manufacturers to make a return for investment but there must me a limit. Vaccines economics demand that we must aggressively support the governments that seek to manufacture vaccines to make them affordable.\u201d\n\nThe panelist also slammed the West over the current vaccine politics, which they said was a repeat to the 1990s\u2019 HIV/AIDS ARVs access fight.\n\n\u201cAs we can now see, there is a vaccine apartheid against Africa and we need vaccine justice. At this point, we need to retain every dollar to invest within the continent. And that\u2019s why we must ask for low vaccination costs,\u201d Mr Abugre said, adding that \u201cwestern countries have failed to live up to their promise. We were told no one is safe until we all are fully vaccinated. And yet we see vaccine hoarding and this puts us in a bad position.

It\u2019s been tough and the challenges we have faced\u00a0a year later have\u00a0exposed the vulnerability of the continent as unable to control its own destiny. We can still do better,\u201d Dr Vito said.</p>\n\n<p>AstraZeneca has managed to offer two thirds of vaccines to third world countries, with 45 million doses distributed to Africa. The rest of the Mehta vaccines include\u00a0those from Moderna, Johnson &amp; Johnson, and others.</p>\n\n<p>\u201cWe started out well, but with the Indian ban on vaccine exports, the vaccination campaign not just in Africa but the rest of the\u00a0developing world slowed down.\u00a0However, in the last two months, we have delivered 17.5 million vaccines across Africa,\u201d she said.</p>\n\n<p>According to Africa CDC, under 10 per cent of the continent's population has been fully vaccinated, against a target of 40 per cent as per the World Health Organisation (WHO) recommendation. The low vaccination numbers have been attributed to vaccine access that disfavor the continent coupled with apathy driven by myths and fears.</p>\n\n<p>\u201cYes, we do have barriers as a continent. But we also have to appreciate the efforts made and so much more to ensure the vulnerable aren\u2019t exposed. As scientists, we can confirm that the latest variant is still within the containment of the testing, and vaccines available,\u201d Dr Vito said.</p>\n\n<p>She added that \u201cWe need to see at least 40 per cent of the population\u00a0vaccinated before we even think of booster shots. The booster conversation isn\u2019t something Africa should even have. Instead, the continent should focus its attention in getting as many adults as possible to be vaccinated.\u201d</p>\n\n<p>Speaking at the panel discussion on the continent's vaccine acquisition, Dr John Mark Bwanika, the Director of Operations Rocket Health Africa, said that Covid has shown that Africa needs to move much faster than we were doing before.</p>\n\n<p>\u201cThe pandemic has given us a boost to improve our health infrastructure.\u00a0\u00a0We need to pick lessons from unique vaccination rollouts across Africa with model countries like Rwanda leaving a lot to be emulated. We have seen misunderstandings in the rollout that slowed down\u00a0the process, but now the exercise is picking up,\u201c Dr Bwanika said, adding that despite the vaccines coming later than the continent needed them, Africa needs to do more to push up the numbers.</p>\n\n<p>Charles Abugre, a member of the programme advisory committee at Christian Aid, lamented the cost of vaccine acquisition for the continent, terming it as unsustainable.</p>\n\n<p>\u201cWe are paying far more for the vaccines than the rich countries. At $10 a dose, that\u2019s too much for the continent to bear. This is despite the huge public costs that went into the vaccines,\u201d Mr Abugre said.</p>\n\n<p>He added; \u201cWe recognise the need for the vaccine manufacturers to make a return for investment but there must me a limit. Vaccines economics demand that we must aggressively support the governments that seek to manufacture vaccines to make them\u00a0affordable.\u201d</p>\n\n<p>The panelist also slammed the West over the current vaccine politics, which they said was a repeat to the 1990s\u2019\u00a0\u00a0HIV/AIDS ARVs access fight.</p>\n\n<p>\u201cAs we can now see, there is a vaccine apartheid against Africa and we need vaccine justice. At this point, we need to retain every dollar to invest within the continent. And that\u2019s why we must ask for low vaccination costs,\u201d Mr Abugre said, adding that\u00a0\u201cwestern countries have failed to live up to their promise. We were told no one is safe until we all are fully vaccinated. And yet we see vaccine hoarding and this puts us in a bad position. How then do we achieve the numbers when we don\u2019t have the support to access vaccines?\u201d</p>\n\n<p>The panelist also waded into the current afrophobia that has seen parts of Southern Africa red listed by over 30 countries over the latest Omnicron variant terming it as \u2018unfortunate and illogical.\u201d</p>\n\n<p>\u201cAny form of Virus will always mutate and scientists know this. The closure of borders is less to do with science and more of political. We are proud of what the scientists did is laudable.

It is unfortunate to witness that no such call has come forth from some in the Council.\u2019\n\nThe proposal to discuss Ethiopia emerged last Friday, pushed by the European Union.\n\nOn Monday, EU\u2019s Head of Delegation to the UN in Geneva, Lotte Knudsen, wrote a joint letter with Slovak Permanent Representative to the UN in Geneva, Anita Pipan, asking for a special session \u201cbecause of the importance and urgency of the situation\u201d in Ethiopia.\n\nThey said the request had the support of both members and observer states of the Human Rights Council, such as the US (which only returned to supporting the body after President Donald Trump left power.)\n\nAs is the rule, such a move required at least a third of the members supporting and according to the letter, 17 members of the Council and 35 non-members endorsed the call to have it go on later on Tuesday.\n\nNone of Africa\u2019s members of the Council endorsed the move and none of the non-members who support the call came from Africa.\n\nThe continent is currently represented by Burkina Faso, Cameroon, Ivory Coast, Gabon, Eritrea, Libya, Malawi, Namibia, Senegal, Somalia, Sudan and Togo.\n\nThey are all serving three-year terms on the Council, although their start dates are staggered as is tradition with the Council.\n\nThe call though has been endorsed by other members, including South Korea, Fiji, Ukraine, Japan, Poland, Netherlands, Mexico and Bulgaria.\n\n\u201cThe Human Rights Council has to stand up to its responsibilities,\u201d Knudsen said on Monday, amplifying the call by EU High Representative Josep Borrel who had said the world has not reacted \u201cproperly to the large-scale human rights violations, mass rapes using sexual violence as a war arm, killings and concentration camps based on ethnic belonging.\u201d\n\nThe problem though, says Ethiopia, is that discussing the country\u2019s war problem appears to repeat what has already been done.\n\nEarlier in August, the Ethiopian Human Rights Commission and the UN High Commissioner for Human Rights conducted a joint investigation into alleged rights violations and abuses, and violations of international humanitarian law and refugee law.\n\nIt found that both the Tigray People\u2019s Liberation Front (TPLF) and the Ethiopian government forces and allied militia had committed atrocities, including killings, rape, forcible displacement and torture. But it did not find evidence of genocide.\n\nEthiopia says it has since formed a multiagency taskforce to implement some of the proposals in the report, including prosecution, rehabilitation of those who surrender, humanitarian service as well as assisting those who were sexually violated.\n\nThe problem though is that the war hasn\u2019t stopped.\n\nThe government and the TPLF, once a ruling party and now a proscribed group, have been fighting since November last year.", "articleBodyHtml": "<article>\n\n<figure><img

was due to be held later on Tuesday but the suggestion lacked African support.</p>\n\n<p>Those pushing for the debate were mostly Western members of the Council, including the United Kingdom, Germany, Italy, France and Denmark.</p>\n\n<p>The revelations emerged a day after Ethiopia issued a call to members of the Council to reject what it called a \u201cregrettable\u201d move to have the Tigray war discussed for the possibility of creating a special team to investigate war crimes in the country.</p>\n\n<p>The Ethiopian Ministry of Foreign Affairs\u00a0said the move had a \u201cpolitically motivated objective\u201d and accused some members of the human rights body of choosing \u201cto advance their political agenda through the work of the Council.\u201d</p>\n\n<p>\u201cEthiopia therefore calls on members of the Council to categorically reject and vote against the special session and its politically motivated outcome,\u201d it said on Monday in a statement.</p>\n\n<p>\u201cWhat should have been a priority for the Council instead was the urgent task of carrying out investigation into the violations of human rights and atrocities committed by the TPLF terrorist group in the Afar and Amhara regional states. It is unfortunate to witness that no such call has come forth from some in the Council.\u2019</p>\n\n<p>The proposal to discuss Ethiopia emerged last Friday, pushed by the European Union.</p>\n\n<p>On Monday, EU\u2019s Head of Delegation to the UN in Geneva, Lotte Knudsen, wrote a joint letter with Slovak Permanent Representative to the UN in Geneva, Anita Pipan, asking for a special session \u201cbecause of the importance and urgency of the situation\u201d in Ethiopia.</p>\n\n<p>They said the request had the support of both members and observer states of the Human Rights Council, such as the US (which only returned to supporting the body after President Donald Trump left power.)</p>\n\n<p>As is the rule, such a move required at least a third of the members supporting and according to the letter, 17 members of the Council and 35 non-members endorsed the call to have it go on later on Tuesday.</p>\n\n<p>None of Africa\u2019s members of the Council endorsed the move and none of the non-members who support the call came from Africa.</p>\n\n<p>The continent is currently represented by Burkina Faso, Cameroon, Ivory Coast, Gabon, Eritrea, Libya, Malawi, Namibia, Senegal, Somalia, Sudan and Togo.</p>\n\n<p>They are all serving three-year terms on the Council, although their start dates are staggered as is tradition with the Council.</p>\n\n<p>The call though has been endorsed by other members, including South Korea, Fiji, Ukraine, Japan, Poland, Netherlands, Mexico and Bulgaria.</p>\n\n<p>\u201cThe Human Rights Council has to stand up to its responsibilities,\u201d Knudsen said on Monday, amplifying the call by EU High Representative Josep Borrel who had said the world has not reacted \u201cproperly to the large-scale human rights violations, mass rapes using sexual violence as a war arm, killings and concentration camps based on ethnic belonging.\u201d</p>\n\n<p>The problem though, says Ethiopia, is that discussing the country\u2019s war problem appears to repeat what has already been done.</p>\n\n<p>Earlier in August, the Ethiopian Human Rights Commission and the UN High Commissioner for Human Rights conducted a joint investigation into alleged rights violations and abuses, and violations of international humanitarian law and refugee law.</p>\n\n<p>It found that both the Tigray People\u2019s Liberation Front (TPLF) and the Ethiopian government forces and allied militia had committed atrocities, including killings, rape, forcible displacement and torture. But it did not find evidence of genocide.</p>\n\n<p>Ethiopia says it has since formed a multiagency taskforce to implement some of the proposals in the report, including prosecution, rehabilitation of those who surrender, humanitarian service as well as assisting those who were sexually violated.</p>\n\n<p>The problem though is that the war hasn\u2019t stopped.</p>\n\n<p>The government and the TPLF, once a ruling party and now a proscribed group, have been fighting since November last year.</p>\n\n</article>", "canonicalUrl": "https://www.theeastafrican.co.ke/tea/rest-of-africa/un-ethiopia-human-rights-3652828"},{"url": "https://www.theeastafrican.co.ke/tea/news/east-africa/ethiopia-war-kenya-issues-advisory-3652102", "probability": 0.9777469, "headline": "Ethiopia war: Kenya issues advisory", "datePublished": "2021-12-14T05:30:00+00:00", "datePublishedRaw": "2021-12-14T05:30:00Z", "dateModified": "2021-12-14T05:47:59+00:00", "dateModifiedRaw": "2021-12-14T05:47:59Z", "author": "AGGREY MUTAMBO", "authorsList": ["AGGREY MUTAMBO"], "inLanguage": "en", "breadcrumbs": [{"name": "Home", "link": "https://www.theeastafrican.co.ke/tea"}, {"name": "News", "link": "https://www.theeastafrican.co.ke/tea/news"}, {"name": "East Africa", "link": "https://www.theeastafrican.co.ke/tea/news/east-africa"}], "mainImage": "https://www.theeastafrican.co.ke/resource/blob/3652110/c3a9493801f08ddbaf6cf64c30878f35/uhuru-abiy-data.jpg", "description": "\nA number of countries\u2014 including the US, UK and Ireland\u2014 have warned their nationals to leave Ethiopia as soon as possible.

It discusses key steps in the design, implementation and monitoring of child-sensitive social protection programmes. It also addresses the policies, strategies and laws crucial to having effective child-sensitive social protection programmes. The document gives guidelines on how to identify gaps in existing social protection schemes for children and how to address them. Importantly, the guide discusses factors that determine how child-sensitive a social protection programme is.\n\nThe guide targets policymakers and implementers of social protection programmes in government and non-state sectors who are seeking to initiate child-sensitive social protection or strengthen existing initiatives. It advocates for holistic rights-based child-sensitive social protection programmes. Regardless of economic status, states have the obligation to undertake policy, legislative, budgetary and administrative measures to increase and improve the quality of public investments in children.\n\nCountries that have ratified the United Nations Convention on the Rights of the Child are required to budget appropriately for children. Budgetary measures include mobilising resources regionally and nationally towards implementation of children\u2019s rights, including those who are internally displaced, refugees, girls, and those belonging to minority social and religious groups.\n\nTo give social-economic context, the document explains the kind of vulnerabilities faced by many children in Africa. There is increasing recognition that beyond income poverty, a large proportion of children are affected by more than one type of deprivation with regard to education, health, shelter, water and sanitation.\n\nThe Oxford Poverty and Human Development Initiative index shows that 63.5 percent of children in Sub-Saharan Africa are multi-dimensionally poor. This is the highest incidence of multidimensional poverty among developing regions. In countries such as Burkina Faso, Chad, Ethiopia, Niger and South Sudan, 90 percent or more of children under the age of 10 are multi-dimensionally poor.\n\nThe guide gives steps to be taken before initiating a child-sensitive social protection programme. First is to understand the extent and reasons for child poverty and vulnerability in the given context. This is done by analysis of primary and/or secondary data. This exercise clarifies the incidence, types and levels of child deprivation and vulnerability.\n\nPrimary data collection aims at assessing availability of services such as health care, education, water and sanitation, nutrition and shelter, as well as the quality of services offered. Primary data collection also involves assessing the knowledge, attitudes and practices of a community that may contribute to factors that impact negatively on child development.\n\nAnalysis of secondary data also helps to determine the kinds of vulnerabilities facing children. For example, a child-sensitive social protection intervention that aims to reduce harmful child labour and improve school attendance may look at data and trends for literacy, school attendance regularity and retention, and harmful child labour, and then break these down by gender and different socio-economic groups.\n\nThe next step after analysing the types of vulnerabilities children face is to identify gaps and opportunities in policy, laws and programmes with regard to existing child-sensitive social protection programmes. This is done by reviewing background information, design, operational features, and the monitoring and evaluation system of programmes.\n\nIdentifying gaps in social protection policies is crucial. This step helps programmes, policies and laws to become more sensitive to specific needs of children. Knowledge gained from this exercise also helps to inform and shape advocacy on child-sensitive social protection with state and non-state actors.\n\nOne way of gaining political support for child-sensitive social protection is to engage in advocacy. Advocacy can be targeted to line ministries in charge of children, gender, social protection, finance, education, health, housing, water and sanitation, among others. Advocacy can also be targeted at members of parliament or parliamentary house committees in charge of social welfare or social protection.\n\nOther targets of advocacy include the media, partners who support governments in implementing social protection programmes, and civil society organisations. Regional level advocacy can involve working with the African Union or other regional blocks, such as the Southern Africa Development Co-operation, the East African Community and the Economic Community of West African States. Advocacy targeting regional and international human rights institutions is also important so as to enhance accountability for child-sensitive social protection programming.\n\nAppraisal of programmes, policy and laws can reveal opportunities for inter-agency cooperation, including between government and non-state entities. This process involves review of background of programmes as well as implementing and financing agencies. It also looks at design and operational features, and the methods used to determine eligibility to social protection programmes.\n\nPolicy and legal review can lead to further opportunities. For example, it can show gaps in connecting existing social protection and other complementary programmes. A good instance of complementary linkages is the Livelihood Against Poverty programme in Ghana, which has been able to link cash transfer with subsidised enrolment in the National Health Insurance Scheme. In this instance, cash transfer has been linked to insurance support in order to address multidimensional vulnerability. The Cash Plus programme in Tanzania and South Africa\u2019s child grant have also been able to link cash transfer with other complementary social protection measures.\n\nThe next step is to use the knowledge gained from the surveys, analysis and reviews to design viable and appropriate child-sensitive social protection interventions. Social protection interventions are divided into three categories: social assistance, social insurance and labour market.\n\nSocial assistance includes regular and predictable cash transfers, vouchers or in-kind assistance such as school meals that do not require a contribution from the beneficiary. Examples of cash transfers include maternal and child grants, pensions, disability grants, widowhood grants, etc. Social assistance also includes subsidies or fee waivers for goods and basic services.\n\nSocial insurance beneficiaries typically support it by making contributions, though it may be subsidised by the government, especially for the poorest. Examples are health and accident insurance, disability insurance, maternity benefits, workplace pensions or unemployment benefits. Labour market policies and interventions include livelihood programmes, skills training, minimum wage policy, wage subsidies, maternity policy, and protection in the workplace.\n\nIntervention could also be in the form of strengthening social protection programmes at policy and legal levels. This helps existing policy and legal frameworks to become more sensitive to child rights and child protection. There is an opportunity to promote and incorporate principles of child-sensitive social protection in situations where there are no specific policies and laws on social protection.\n\nThe guide stresses the importance of children\u2019s participation. The level of child participation can be assessed by analysing the extent to which girls and boys of different ages, and their care givers, are able to access and benefit from social protection at each point in their life cycle. It is therefore crucial for these services to be indiscriminately available and accessible to all children and their families.\n\nChildren\u2019s participation is one of the factors that indicate a child-sensitive approach to social protection. Other principles of child-sensitive social protection include respect for children\u2019s views which should be canvassed without intimidation, respect for their views, and protection of children against all kinds of risks. Additional principles are inclusivity of all children regardless of gender, religion or other classification. Child-sensitive programmes also give feedback to children on how their participation has influenced outcomes. Additionally, child-sensitive programmes have adults who are trained to work with children.\n\nThe guide notes that most of the existing social accountability tools do not monitor the outcomes of social protection programmes for children. Monitoring the impact of social protection programmes is often limited to measuring reduction of poverty levels, increased food consumption, and improvements in livelihoods in households.\n\nHowever, child-sensitive social protection goes beyond poverty reduction and food consumption, and considers the needs of children in the beneficiary households, including access to services such as sanitation, education, health, water and nutrition, among others. It is important to have a participatory monitoring approach, which involves beneficiaries and communities. Listening to and learning from programme beneficiaries, including children, is critical in making programme improvements.\n\nFinally, the guide discusses factors that determine how child sensitive a social protection programme is. These factors include the extent to which girls and boys of different ages and their caregivers are able to access and benefit from social protection at each point in their life cycle, degree of positive impact on children by age, gender and different forms of vulnerability, and to what extent the intervention has minimised negative and adverse consequences for children.\n\nAbout the Africa Platform for Social Protection:\n\nAfrica Platform for Social Protection (APSP) is a network of organisations operating at sub-national, national and regional levels across Africa. APSP exists to strengthen civil society engagement with the articulation, formulation and implementation of social protection policies and programmes.\n\nThe network\u2019s goal and purpose is to support the development of effective national social protection policies and programmes for people facing poverty and exclusion, and thereby contribute to the achievement of the Sustainable Development Goals and the implementation of the Social Policy Framework (SPF).\n\nAbout Save the Children\n\nSave the Children has been providing support to children across the world for over 100 years, through a combination of development and humanitarian programmes. We work with communities, local partners, and the government to design and deliver programmes to meet the needs of the most deprived children. We also advocate for greater investment of public and private resources for children.", "articleBodyHtml": "<article>\n\n<p>The Africa Platform for Social Protection and Save the Children International East and Southern Africa Regional Office, have developed a guide to support child-sensitive social protection programmes in Africa.</p>\n\n<p>The guide gives an understanding of child-sensitive social protection as \u201cpublic policies, programmes and systems that address the specific patterns of children\u2019s poverty and vulnerability, are rights-based in approach and recognise the long term developmental benefits of investing in children\u201d (Save the Children, International, 2020).</p>\n\n<p>The guide similarly gives an overview of the international conventions that oblige governments to develop social protection initiatives targeting children.\u00a0It discusses key steps in the design, implementation and monitoring of child-sensitive social protection programmes.

It is therefore crucial for these services to be indiscriminately available and accessible to all children and their families.</p>\n\n<figure><img src=\"data:image/png;base64,iVBORw0KGgoAAAANSUhEUgAAAAEAAAABCAQAAAC1HAwCAAAAC0lEQVR42mNkYAAAAAYAAjCB0C8AAAAASUVORK5CYII=\" alt=\"Celina's daughter, Rose, gets checked for malaria at Save the Children's mobile clinic in Uganda.\" title=\"\" data-cm-responsive-media='[{\"name\":\"landscape_ratio16x9\",\"ratioWidth\":16,\"ratioHeight\":9,\"linksForWidth\":{\"200\":\"/resource/image/3637192/landscape_ratio16x9/200/112/398d30ceea11ed0894155a68468db8d2/On/photo-1.jpg\",\"300\":\"/resource/image/3637192/landscape_ratio16x9/300/168/398d30ceea11ed0894155a68468db8d2/Tf/photo-1.jpg\",\"400\":\"/resource/image/3637192/landscape_ratio16x9/400/225/398d30ceea11ed0894155a68468db8d2/xS/photo-1.jpg\",\"1160\":\"/resource/image/3637192/landscape_ratio16x9/1160/652/398d30ceea11ed0894155a68468db8d2/ry/photo-1.jpg\"}},{\"name\":\"portrait_ratio2x3\",\"ratioWidth\":2,\"ratioHeight\":3,\"linksForWidth\":{\"200\":\"/resource/image/3637192/portrait_ratio2x3/200/300/136b65b730c53d407f6191189fa9c547/Bp/photo-1.jpg\",\"400\":\"/resource/image/3637192/portrait_ratio2x3/400/600/136b65b730c53d407f6191189fa9c547/YC/photo-1.jpg\",\"768\":\"/resource/image/3637192/portrait_ratio2x3/768/1152/136b65b730c53d407f6191189fa9c547/BC/photo-1.jpg\"}},{\"name\":\"landscape_ratio2x1\",\"ratioWidth\":2,\"ratioHeight\":1,\"linksForWidth\":{\"200\":\"/resource/image/3637192/landscape_ratio2x1/200/100/b2de705c0ed600bfce45c26b63da8a3c/gE/photo-1.jpg\"}},{\"name\":\"landscape_ratio3x2\",\"ratioWidth\":3,\"ratioHeight\":2,\"linksForWidth\":{\"300\":\"/resource/image/3637192/landscape_ratio3x2/300/200/d58a3243f0a74287c171c5f9f3295f5b/QU/photo-1.jpg\",\"400\":\"/resource/image/3637192/landscape_ratio3x2/400/267/d58a3243f0a74287c171c5f9f3295f5b/Bu/photo-1.jpg\",\"768\":\"/resource/image/3637192/landscape_ratio3x2/768/512/d58a3243f0a74287c171c5f9f3295f5b/JY/photo-1.jpg\"}},{\"name\":\"portrait_ratio1x1\",\"ratioWidth\":1,\"ratioHeight\":1,\"linksForWidth\":{\"50\":\"/resource/image/3637192/portrait_ratio1x1/50/50/2836c63262a10c2fbbf9ede392b50cd2/pI/photo-1.jpg\",\"60\":\"/resource/image/3637192/portrait_ratio1x1/60/60/2836c63262a10c2fbbf9ede392b50cd2/fR/photo-1.jpg\",\"200\":\"/resource/image/3637192/portrait_ratio1x1/200/200/2836c63262a10c2fbbf9ede392b50cd2/MZ/photo-1.jpg\",\"400\":\"/resource/image/3637192/portrait_ratio1x1/400/400/2836c63262a10c2fbbf9ede392b50cd2/kr/photo-1.jpg\",\"768\":\"/resource/image/3637192/portrait_ratio1x1/768/768/2836c63262a10c2fbbf9ede392b50cd2/QM/photo-1.jpg\"}},{\"name\":\"landscape_ratio4x3\",\"ratioWidth\":4,\"ratioHeight\":3,\"linksForWidth\":{\"200\":\"/resource/image/3637192/landscape_ratio4x3/200/150/e416a994b5a79c21d01e359ea6de3ff2/mN/photo-1.jpg\",\"400\":\"/resource/image/3637192/landscape_ratio4x3/400/300/e416a994b5a79c21d01e359ea6de3ff2/Uk/photo-1.jpg\",\"768\":\"/resource/image/3637192/landscape_ratio4x3/768/576/e416a994b5a79c21d01e359ea6de3ff2/HI/photo-1.jpg\"}}]'>\n\n<figcaption><p>Celina's daughter, Rose, gets checked for malaria at Save the Children's mobile clinic in Imvepi refugee settlement, Uganda.

Additional principles are inclusivity of all children regardless of gender, religion or other classification. Child-sensitive programmes also give feedback to children on how their participation has influenced outcomes. Additionally, child-sensitive programmes have adults who are trained to work with children.</p>\n\n<p>The guide notes that most of the existing social accountability tools do not monitor the outcomes of social protection programmes for children. Monitoring the impact of social protection programmes is often limited to measuring reduction of poverty levels, increased food consumption, and improvements in livelihoods in households.</p>\n\n<p>However, child-sensitive social protection goes beyond poverty reduction and food consumption, and considers the needs of children in the beneficiary households, including access to services such as sanitation, education, health, water and nutrition, among others. It is important to have a participatory monitoring approach, which involves beneficiaries and communities. Listening to and learning from programme beneficiaries, including children, is critical in making programme improvements.</p>\n\n<p>Finally, the guide discusses factors that determine how child sensitive a social protection programme is. These factors include the extent to which girls and boys of different ages and their caregivers are able to access and benefit from social protection at each point in their life cycle, degree of positive impact on children by age, gender and different forms of vulnerability, and to what extent the intervention has minimised negative and adverse consequences for children.</p>\n\n<p><strong>About the Africa Platform for Social Protection:</strong></p>\n\n<p>Africa Platform for Social Protection (APSP) is a network of organisations operating at sub-national, national and regional levels across Africa. APSP exists to strengthen civil society engagement with the articulation, formulation and implementation of social protection policies and programmes.</p>\n\n<p>The network\u2019s goal and purpose is to support the development of effective national social protection policies and programmes for people facing poverty and exclusion, and thereby contribute to the achievement of the Sustainable Development Goals and the implementation of the Social Policy Framework (SPF).</p>\n\n<p><strong>About Save the Children</strong></p>\n\n<p>Save the Children has been providing support to children across the world for over 100 years, through a combination of development and humanitarian programmes.

It has upended the world as we knew it, an equal opportunity virus. Rich countries and poor alike find themselves at the mercy of a disease that keeps shifting away from all the efforts we make to contain it. While this gives me no joy, I must point out the equalising effect of this. Together in misery, we are the world.\n\nI remain more interested in solutions than problems, but when I was asked to write about the role of women in a post-covid-19 world I found myself stumped. Is this a matter of leadership? What does gender have to do with it? Perhaps I can think of this in terms of numbers? After all, there are always slightly more women than there are men in most societies.\n\nUnlike other diseases Covid-19 doesn\u2019t discriminate by sex as far as I am aware of. It only cares to bully those who have pre-existing conditions, and those who are a bit longer in the tooth. The only angle that I can perceive in this situation is an economic one.\n\nPoverty is unkind to people, it is much more responsible for ill health than anything else. Africa isn\u2019t poor per se, but we don\u2019t have cash money, it keeps escaping us. And because we remain stubbornly patriarchal the ones who have the least of it are women, children, youth and disempowered men.\n\nI guess that this is why Africa was expected to suffer the worst of all from Covid-19. We still struggle with malaria, we have zoonotic diseases like Ebola fretting us all the time, HIV/Aids continues to rampage through our societies and we are cash poor.\n\nDespite all this, the data seems to be suggesting that Africa is not affected in the way that was expected. I live in a country that denied we even had the disease until May of this year, and I can assure you that we suffered for it.\n\nA lot of people caught \u201catypical pneumonia,\u201d we lost loved ones, the trauma is real. And yet, somehow, we have survived. What can we attribute this to, what should we do to guarantee our continued survival?\n\nThe data shows that what seems to have helped is the youth of the continent. We are overwhelmingly young. I do not think that we can leverage this advantage if we keep on being stubbornly patriarchal.\n\nWomen are the powerhouse of Africa when it comes to agriculture and health, we always have been and we always will be.\n\nHowever, it is also true that our participation on the formal economy is underwhelming. We cannot afford to continue like this, undervaluing the talents and the sheer force of half the population. Often we feminists are misunderstood to be emotional, but there is a stone cold motivation in there too. Cash money.\n\nAgain, the data is there. If you want a society to do well, the money is best put in the hands of women. We are much more consistent in taking care of our social networks, we are much more intense about healthcare and will show up at the hospitals.\n\nWe are consummate consumers and loyal voters. And when an epidemic shows up? We are on the frontlines of protecting ourselves, the little ones and the elders. In order to do all of this well, we need cash money. Not hand-outs, just simple respect and pay for the work that we carry out.\n\nAnd we take our people to vaccinate, from the little babies to the old folks. If there is one area in which we can show our strength with immediate effects, this might be it. Along with Covid denial Tanzania suffered a strong anti-vaccination movement that has now become a habit. It is a sad reality, and a hard one to fight.\n\nThe lack of logic astounds me sometimes: the same people who make sure their children eat right and get their shots are capable of turning around and denying that modern medicine is based on safe science. And then they go off and buy Panadol in the same breath.\n\nGiven all of these circumstances, what indeed is the role of women in a post-Covid Africa? I remain convinced that it is economic power. Not empowerment, mind you- that word has been misused and abused beyond recognition.\n\nBut I believe that when women\u2019s work is recognised and remunerated accordingly, everyone benefits from it. The trickle-down effect is intensified, social investment is increased, all of the things that support health and well-being get much more attention. The impulse to buy Boeings with cash-money gets controlled better.\n\nWe are a young continent, yes, and we tend to find a way to survive epidemics.

They fear their sons could be dead.\n\nThe families of Abshir Ali Garo (27), Jackson Njue (32) and Muhamed Abubakar Said (22) have since implicated the police for their disappearance, saying the abductors were dressed in police uniforms and introduced themselves as officers.\n\nGaro and Njue, who are friends, were picked by the police at Ukunda in Kenya\u2019s South Coast on July 24 while having lunch. They were driven to Mombasa, where Garo\u2019s family resides, and since then have not been seen.\n\nGaro was a hawker, selling small electronics and phones in different towns at the Kenyan Coast. His family described him as polite.\n\n\u201cAt around 9.30pm, I heard a knock at my door. I hesitated to open it but when the men identified themselves as police officers, I proceeded and opened the door. Some jumped in and started asking for a bag that they said had money in it. The rest of the police officers stood guard outside,\u201d narrated Garo\u2019s mother, Dhahabo Hassan.\n\nMs Hassan, said she was shocked and confused when police ransacked her house claiming to be looking for money and a person they identified as \u2018Rama\u2019.\n\nShe was to learn that her son was outside the house in the custody of the police when she heard commotion as the police were beating him.\n\n\u201cWhile they were ransacking my house, I was wondering who led them to my residence only to look through the window and see my son being beaten by two police officers,\u201d said Ms Hassan.\n\nMs Hassan has now been left disturbed, not knowing when she will set eyes on her sixth born child.\n\nShe has visited different police stations and several mortuaries in search of her son, in vain.\n\n\u201cWhen the officers were leaving my house, they asked me to report to Central Police Station in Nairobi where my son was being taken but since they left, I have not seen him even at the police station where they claimed they were taking him,\u201d said the distraught mother.\n\nNjue\u2019s cousin, Charles Njue, said the last time he saw his relative was three months before his abduction.\n\n\u201cMy cousin travelled to the Coast in April this year to do business barely three months before he went missing. He had been working in several fields including sales promotions. We had been talking all through until July 24, 2021, when his phone went off,\u201d said Charles.\n\nPolice involvement\n\nPolice have since remained mum over the disappearance but Njue and Garo\u2019s families have reported the cases to Nyali and Majengo police stations with OB Nos 11/3/8/2021 and 05/26/7/2021 respectively.\n\nThe family of Mr Said who was also abducted is pointing fingers at the police while hoping that one day their kin will come back home safe.\n\nThe madrassa teacher went missing on October 14 after leaving a mosque in Majengo, Mombasa.\n\nHis relatives said their kin was \u2018arrested\u2019 by armed individuals suspected to be police officers and bundled into a private car.\n\nThe family said Said was an obedient youth and a role model to many; he was pursuing a diploma at Umma University and did not have a criminal record.\n\nThe family\u2019s lawyer Mohammed Faki said the youth has been a role model who sensitised other youths in the county against extremism, radicalisation and alcoholism and drug abuse. He called on police to deal with the many cases of enforced disappearance in the region.\n\nMr Faki, who is also the Mombasa senator, said he will petition the Kenyan Senate to discuss extra-judicial killings and enforced disappearance.\n\n\u201cThe Senate must probe this matter conclusively to put an end to this pandemic. Abubakar is a well-known youth in Mombasa. He is an obedient and religious child. He used to lead in Islamic prayers at Masjid Ibrahim in Ganjoni whenever the imam was away,\u201d said the senator.\n\nThe three are among 43 people who have been allegedly abducted by Kenyan security officers since January this year and whose whereabouts continue to be a mystery. Questions on how the exercise is conducted remain unanswered.\n\nThe latest case of such arrests is the of an Ethiopian businessman who was picked by people believed to be police officers in Nairobi on November 19 in broad daylight. According to an amateur video, the businessman, Samson Teklemichael, was driving when he was stopped by a man wearing traffic police uniform. He was thereafter removed from his car by men in civilian clothes who dragged him into another car as other road users recorded the drama.\n\nHis wife Milen Mezgebo said she has not been able to locate him since then.\n\n\u201cHe called and told me he had been abducted by people he didn\u2019t know. After that, he disconnected. We have reported the matter to the police and embassy but no help so far,\u201d she said.\n\nEthiopian case\n\nKenyan police at Kilimani said they are investigating the abduction.\n\nTeklemichael is originally from Tigray and deals with oil and gas products in Nairobi and Addis Ababa. His whereabouts remain unclear considering the civil unrest in Ethiopia.\n\nAbout 12 victims of abductions, some who were held for more than a month, were recently released but have since remained quiet without narrating what they underwent in the hands of their captors.\n\nKenya has between January and November this year recorded 55 cases of persons who have either been killed or who mysteriously disappeared in the hands of suspected security agencies, the highest number ever reported.\n\nThe Coast region leads with the highest number of such cases according to latest data compiled by Haki Africa, a human rights organisation based in Mombasa.\n\nHaki Africa says 29 people have mysteriously disappeared at the Kenyan Coast this year, 19 of them from Mombasa and nine from Kwale County. Nairobi region had seven such cases followed by Kajiado (four), Lamu (three) and Wajir, Nyeri, and Kiambu each recorded one case.\n\nHaki Africa Executive Director Hussein Khalid challenged the Kenya government to ratify the international convention against enforced disappearances and adopt laws to outlaw the crime in Kenya.\n\nAs the number of disappearances continue to increase, the Kenyan Anti-Terror Police Unit (ATPU) has turned its sights onto social media platforms that are emerging as the new recruitment forum for Kenyan youths to join terrorist groups.\n\nAccording to ATPU, recruiters have taken advantage of platforms such as Telegram and WhatsApp to recruit young people into Al-Shabaab and ISIS groups.\n\nThe revelation comes following the arrest of two people, including a Tanzanian, by ATPU officers for recruiting youth to join the terror groups through a Telegram group.\n\nRajabu Mwinyihamisi Hamza and Iqram Ramadhan Rashid were found to be members of a Telegram group called Khalifa Tul Umah with membership in Somalia, Tanzania, Congo, Mozambique and Kenya.\n\nAccording to a document seen by The EastAfrican, Khalifa Tul Umah and its members are connected to ISIS.\n\n\u201cBased on intelligence reports, the said group \u2014 Khalifa Tul Umah \u2014 largely posts radicalisation materials and other articles that evidence an interest in extreme ideology and recruitment,\u201d Mr Bryzon Wafula of the ATPU said.\n\nSecurity officers are also struggling to deal with the increasing number of tech-savvy youth returnees from Somalia who are in different terror cells run by Al-Shabaab.\n\nAccording to the police, Muslim youth in Kenya are being radicalised and recruited into different terror cells either through technology or in mosques, gyms, madrassas and Islamic associations. Some of those with a bounty on their head for being behind terror cells include Muhamad Abubakar Said alias Minshawary, Elgiva Bwire Oliacha alias Seif Deen, Barigi Abdikadir Haila, Trevor Ndwiga alias Idriss Jamal and Salim Rashid Mohamed.", "articleBodyHtml": "<article>\n\n<figure><img

FARHIYA HUSSEIN</strong></p>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://www.theeastafrican.co.ke/tea/author-profiles/farhiya-hussein-3652214\">More by this Author</a></p>\n\n<p>As cases of enforced disappearance rise in Kenya, several families are distraught not knowing if they would see their kin one day \u2014 either alive or dead.</p>\n\n<p>Up to 43 families have between January and November this year reported cases of their kin being picked by people believed to be from security agencies and their whereabouts have since remained a mystery.</p>\n\n<p>In the Kenyan coastal town of Mombasa, three families whose sons went missing between July and October are among many families that cannot account for their kin after similar disappearances. They fear their sons could be dead.</p>\n\n<p>The families of Abshir Ali Garo (27), Jackson Njue (32) and Muhamed Abubakar Said (22) have since implicated the police for their disappearance, saying the abductors were dressed in police uniforms and introduced themselves as officers.</p>\n\n<p>Garo and Njue, who are friends, were picked by the police at Ukunda in Kenya\u2019s South Coast on July 24 while having lunch. They were driven to Mombasa, where Garo\u2019s family resides, and since then have not been seen.</p>\n\n<p>Garo was a hawker, selling small electronics and phones in different towns at the Kenyan Coast. His family described him as polite.</p>\n\n<p>\u201cAt around 9.30pm, I heard a knock at my door. I hesitated to open it but when the men identified themselves as police officers, I proceeded and opened the door. Some jumped in and started asking for a bag that they said had money in it. The rest of the police officers stood guard outside,\u201d narrated Garo\u2019s mother, Dhahabo Hassan.</p>\n\n<p>Ms Hassan, said she was shocked and confused when police ransacked her house claiming to be looking for money and a person they identified as \u2018Rama\u2019.</p>\n\n<p>She was to learn that her son was outside the house in the custody of the police when she heard commotion as the police were beating him.</p>\n\n<p>\u201cWhile they were ransacking my house, I was wondering who led them to my residence only to look through the window and see my son being beaten by two police officers,\u201d said Ms Hassan.</p>\n\n<p>Ms Hassan has now been left disturbed, not knowing when she will set eyes on her sixth born child.</p>\n\n<p>She has visited different police stations and several mortuaries in search of her son, in vain.</p>\n\n<p>\u201cWhen the officers were leaving my house, they asked me to report to Central Police Station in Nairobi where my son was being taken but since they left, I have not seen him even at the police station where they claimed they were taking him,\u201d said the distraught mother.</p>\n\n<p>Njue\u2019s cousin, Charles Njue, said the last time he saw his relative was three months before his abduction.</p>\n\n<p>\u201cMy cousin travelled to the Coast in April this year to do business barely three months before he went missing. He had been working in several fields including sales promotions. We had been talking all through until July 24, 2021, when his phone went off,\u201d said Charles.</p>\n\n<h2>Police involvement</h2>\n\n<p>Police have since remained mum over the disappearance but Njue and Garo\u2019s families have reported the cases to Nyali and Majengo police stations with OB Nos 11/3/8/2021 and 05/26/7/2021 respectively.</p>\n\n<p>The family of Mr Said who was also abducted is pointing fingers at the police while hoping that one day their kin will come back home safe.</p>\n\n<p>The madrassa teacher went missing on October 14 after leaving a mosque in Majengo, Mombasa.</p>\n\n<p>His relatives said their kin was \u2018arrested\u2019 by armed individuals suspected to be police officers and bundled into a private car.</p>\n\n<p>The family said Said was an obedient youth and a role model to many; he was pursuing a diploma at Umma University and did not have a criminal record.</p>\n\n<p>The family\u2019s lawyer Mohammed Faki said the youth has been a role model who sensitised other youths in the county against extremism, radicalisation and alcoholism and drug abuse. He called on police to deal with the many cases of enforced disappearance in the region.</p>\n\n<p>Mr Faki, who is also the Mombasa senator, said he will petition the Kenyan Senate to discuss extra-judicial killings and enforced disappearance.</p>\n\n<p>\u201cThe Senate must probe this matter conclusively to put an end to this pandemic. Abubakar is a well-known youth in Mombasa. He is an obedient and religious child. He used to lead in Islamic prayers at Masjid Ibrahim in Ganjoni whenever the imam was away,\u201d said the senator.</p>\n\n<p>The three are among 43 people who have been allegedly abducted by Kenyan security officers since January this year and whose whereabouts continue to be a mystery. Questions on how the exercise is conducted remain unanswered.</p>\n\n<p>The latest case of such arrests is the of an Ethiopian businessman who was picked by people believed to be police officers in Nairobi on November 19 in broad daylight. According to an amateur video, the businessman, Samson Teklemichael, was driving when he was stopped by a man wearing traffic police uniform. He was thereafter removed from his car by men in civilian clothes who dragged him into another car as other road users recorded the drama.</p>\n\n<p>His wife Milen Mezgebo said she has not been able to locate him since then.</p>\n\n<p>\u201cHe called and told me he had been abducted by people he didn\u2019t know. After that, he disconnected. We have reported the matter to the police and embassy but no help so far,\u201d she said.</p>\n\n<h2>Ethiopian case</h2>\n\n<p>Kenyan police at Kilimani said they are investigating the abduction.</p>\n\n<p>Teklemichael is originally from Tigray and deals with oil and gas products in Nairobi and Addis Ababa. His whereabouts remain unclear considering the civil unrest in Ethiopia.</p>\n\n<figure><img src=\"data:image/png;base64,iVBORw0KGgoAAAANSUhEUgAAAAEAAAABCAQAAAC1HAwCAAAAC0lEQVR42mNkYAAAAAYAAjCB0C8AAAAASUVORK5CYII=\" alt=\"Ethiopian Milen Mezgebo, whose husband Samson Teklemichael was abducted.\" title=\"\" data-cm-responsive-media='[{\"name\":\"landscape_ratio16x9\",\"ratioWidth\":16,\"ratioHeight\":9,\"linksForWidth\":{\"200\":\"/resource/image/3652218/landscape_ratio16x9/200/112/7ba8f2c4291ebf5c5ac74e4e74a5b554/sE/milen.jpg\",\"300\":\"/resource/image/3652218/landscape_ratio16x9/300/168/7ba8f2c4291ebf5c5ac74e4e74a5b554/Nc/milen.jpg\",\"400\":\"/resource/image/3652218/landscape_ratio16x9/400/225/7ba8f2c4291ebf5c5ac74e4e74a5b554/kr/milen.jpg\",\"1160\":\"/resource/image/3652218/landscape_ratio16x9/1160/652/7ba8f2c4291ebf5c5ac74e4e74a5b554/UT/milen.jpg\"}},{\"name\":\"portrait_ratio2x3\",\"ratioWidth\":2,\"ratioHeight\":3,\"linksForWidth\":{\"200\":\"/resource/image/3652218/portrait_ratio2x3/200/300/8de7d655484ed7f0e2203529f1ac8761/cs/milen.jpg\",\"400\":\"/resource/image/3652218/portrait_ratio2x3/400/600/8de7d655484ed7f0e2203529f1ac8761/Ex/milen.jpg\",\"768\":\"/resource/image/3652218/portrait_ratio2x3/768/1152/8de7d655484ed7f0e2203529f1ac8761/ol/milen.jpg\"}},{\"name\":\"landscape_ratio2x1\",\"ratioWidth\":2,\"ratioHeight\":1,\"linksForWidth\":{\"200\":\"/resource/image/3652218/landscape_ratio2x1/200/100/83e8968131b35474b84df7ba5a0358ce/XQ/milen.jpg\"}},{\"name\":\"landscape_ratio3x2\",\"ratioWidth\":3,\"ratioHeight\":2,\"linksForWidth\":{\"300\":\"/resource/image/3652218/landscape_ratio3x2/300/200/e98a8b394ed9f8682e467ee5017ee543/wn/milen.jpg\",\"400\":\"/resource/image/3652218/landscape_ratio3x2/400/267/e98a8b394ed9f8682e467ee5017ee543/Ml/milen.jpg\",\"768\":\"/resource/image/3652218/landscape_ratio3x2/768/512/e98a8b394ed9f8682e467ee5017ee543/tL/milen.jpg\"}},{\"name\":\"portrait_ratio1x1\",\"ratioWidth\":1,\"ratioHeight\":1,\"linksForWidth\":{\"50\":\"/resource/image/3652218/portrait_ratio1x1/50/50/ac2e7865a9735e0e2c8cbf5a462529aa/kE/milen.jpg\",\"60\":\"/resource/image/3652218/portrait_ratio1x1/60/60/ac2e7865a9735e0e2c8cbf5a462529aa/rp/milen.jpg\",\"200\":\"/resource/image/3652218/portrait_ratio1x1/200/200/ac2e7865a9735e0e2c8cbf5a462529aa/oR/milen.jpg\",\"400\":\"/resource/image/3652218/portrait_ratio1x1/400/400/ac2e7865a9735e0e2c8cbf5a462529aa/sT/milen.jpg\",\"768\":\"/resource/image/3652218/portrait_ratio1x1/768/768/ac2e7865a9735e0e2c8cbf5a462529aa/Jw/milen.jpg\"}},{\"name\":\"landscape_ratio4x3\",\"ratioWidth\":4,\"ratioHeight\":3,\"linksForWidth\":{\"200\":\"/resource/image/3652218/landscape_ratio4x3/200/150/e3e414aac8cca4ab2489591294d4631/dc/milen.jpg\",\"400\":\"/resource/image/3652218/landscape_ratio4x3/400/300/e3e414aac8cca4ab2489591294d4631/Hz/milen.jpg\",\"768\":\"/resource/image/3652218/landscape_ratio4x3/768/576/e3e414aac8cca4ab2489591294d4631/Tz/milen.jpg\"}}]'>\n\n<figcaption><p>Ethiopian Milen Mezgebo, whose husband Samson Teklemichael was abducted by unknown persons on November 19, 2021 and has been missing since.

suspending flights to Sudan.</p>\n\n<p>Last Friday, KQ launched direct flights from South Sudan capital Juba to Khartoum in Sudan as it eyes Africa expansion.</p>\n\n<p>The national carrier said the new flight will originate from the Jomo Kenyatta International Airport (JKIA) in Kenya\u2019s capital Nairobi flying to Khartoum via Juba and back to Nairobi every Wednesday and Sunday.</p>\n\n<p>The airline will also launch another flight from Nairobi to Juba via Khartoum and back to Nairobi on Fridays.</p>\n\n<p>Flights via Juba, on Wednesdays and Sundays, depart Nairobi at 7.40am to arrive in the South Sudanese capital at 9.25am, and leave at 10.05am to get to Khartoum at 11.25am.\u00a0The return trip starts at 12.05pm in Khartoum for Nairobi, arriving at JKIA at 4.10pm.</p>\n\n<p>The Director of the Sudanese Civil Aviation Authority, Fakhri Osman Ahmed, welcomed the move, emphasising the need for cooperation in the field of air transport.</p>\n\n<p>Sa`ad Ahmed Abdel Rahman, director of Khartoum International Airport, said the return of the Kenya Airways flight is a \u201creal addition\u201d to the improvement at the airport that includes a\u00a0new lounge that meets international standards.</p>\n\n<p>Mr Rahman said\u00a0the return of Kenyan Airways has economic and operational gains.</p>\n\n<p>Ngewa Mukala, Kenya's Ambassador to Sudan, welcomed the return of the first trips to Sudan following the Covid-19 pandemic.</p>\n\n<p>He said Sudan and Kenya have strong relations, adding that resuming flights through Juba will serve the interests of the three countries.</p>\n\n<p>Rose Kesley, the Director General of Kenya Airways East Africa office, last Friday said, \u201cWe are honoured to make history today as we come together to celebrate the launch of Kenya Airways, Juba-Khartoum, and I thought this was indeed a huge step\u201d.</p>\n\n<p>\u201cI considered this route as a new addition to our network of 41 destinations around the world, 33 of which are in Africa targeting domestic and international travellers\u2026As an airline, we strive to continuously meet the needs of our customers and society.</p>\n\n<p>\u201cIntroducing this path will increase our connectivity and capabilities that will allow us to serve more customers in the world across the region, as we are stimulating a return to business strategy for the aviation industry.

Geofencing guards against theft and loss of cargo while on transit.\n\nThe NCTTCA said the delay is working against importers of cargo through the port of Mombasa destined to south Tanzania, Burundi and Rwanda who now opt to use a much longer route to import through the port of Dar es Salaam.\n\nSpeaking in Mombasa at the launch of training of heavy truck drivers, NCTTCA chief executive Omae Nyarandi said the delay is frustrating s section of importers using the Central Corridor.\n\n\u201cSince the opening of the one-stop border post (OSBP) at Holili and completion of the Voi-Taveta road, the highway has opened up an alternative route to southern Tanzania and Bujumbura from the Mombasa port. But traders cannot use it since Tanzanian side has not been geo-fenced,\u201d said Mr Nyarandi.\n\nHe added, \u201cTanzania needs to agree to geofence so that we can use the single Customs facility to traverse its territory.

Donovan one morning in 2006 at the Kampala Serena. He was holding an ostrich egg. The door of the lift opened and there he was \u2014 tall with intense, blue eyes. I was on my way to breakfast when I saw him and I blurted, ''I know you! You are Donovan.\u201d\n\nHe smiled and said yes.\n\n\u201cSo what are you doing here?\u201d I asked.\n\nHe was doing the d\u00e9cor for the hotel with African art from around the continent. Breakfast forgotten, I spent the entire day trailing him around.\n\nI watched him turn the hotel into a veritable African art gallery, placing artefacts in the rooms as he talked fondly about them.\n\nThe ostrich egg that he was holding like a child was one of the ancient media of art carved by the desert people of the Kalahari in South Africa. Recent excavations have unearthed more pieces of eggs carved as far back as 60,000 years.\n\nDonovan would later invite me to the African Heritage House and my education on the arts and architecture of Africa began and deepened. It awakened in me an appreciation of Africa's amazing arts.\n\nThe African Heritage House\n\nWhen I returned to Nairobi, Maya, my then eight-year-old niece, and I visited what is arguably the most photographed house in the country. I remember the Maya\u2019s amazement at the grandeur of the building, her eyes almost popping out.\n\nAnd this is where we saw the beauty of African architecture, the fa\u00e7ade replica of the Great mosque of Djenne built in the 13th century. It is the largest mud-brick building in the world. Built in Timbuktu, the mosque was the seat of Islamic learning from the 12th century.\n\nDonovan said, \u201cI promised myself that if l ever built a house, it would be like the mud mosque of Djenne.\u201d\n\nAnd he did.\n\nDonovan came to Africa on July 4, 1967, after he was posted to Nigeria by the US government as a relief officer with the US State Department during the Biafra civil war between 1967 and 1970, which pitted the government of Nigeria and Biafra, a secessionist state that declared its independence in 1967. More than two million Biafrans lost their lives, mostly due to starvation, before the surrender in January 1970. \u201cI saw the worst atrocities at the time,\u201d recalled Donovan.\n\nWhen he returned to the US in 1969, Donovan vowed that if he ever came back to Africa it would be in pursuit of its beauty and not war.\n\nAnd return he did.\n\nAfter crossing the Mediterranean Sea from Europe, he and his friends drove across the Sahara desert into Mali, where he was enchanted with the ancient architecture. From there, it was a journey through Central Africa entering Kenya through Uganda in 1970. In Uganda, Idi Amin was in power at the time. His reign marked by bloodshed and expulsion of Asians. Donovan was almost seized by the Ugandan army, as he was suspected to be a spy.\n\nHe and his friends got away and crossed the border into Kenya, and finally into Nairobi.\n\n\u201cIt was October and the jacaranda trees were in full bloom and l fell in love with the city,\u201d he told me.\n\nNew home\n\nDonovan was soon discovering his new home, travelling across the country. He was fascinated by the Turkana, when he went to the world\u2019s largest alkaline lake by bus in the days when the northern frontier was a \u201cclosed territory\u201d. He bought pieces of jewellery and displayed his first collection at Gallery Watatu, from where a Texan millionaire bought the entire collection.\n\nHe later met Joseph Murumbi, Kenya\u2019s famous artefacts collector who became the country\u2019s second vice-president after Jaramogi Oginga Odinga quit in 1966. Donovan and Murumbi became partners in the new venture, African Heritage. At the opening of an African Heritage art show, Murumbi made an impassioned speech, urging Africans to invest in their own art.\n\nMurumbi and his wife Sheila were consummate collectors of everything African, building up one of the most coveted book and stamp collections, including the earliest-known books written by African slaves that are now housed in the 1913 Nairobi Gallery in downtown Nairobi. It features the Murumbis\u2019 extensive art collections, including those of Africa\u2019s pioneer artists at Independence like the late Expedito Mwebe Kibbula.\n\nDonovan regaled the world with his collections including spectacular fashion shows that showcased Africa\u2019s textiles, like the spider-woven silk cloth from Madagascar, the colourful Kente from West Africa, the batik from Nigeria and the geometric-patterned Kuba cloth from the forests of the Democratic Republic of Congo.\n\nHe launched many a famous name on the international catwalk like Khadija Adams, who became Yves St Laurent\u2019s first lead African model in Paris in 1980.\n\nTourists flocked to the African Heritage shop that was the first pan-African gallery on Kenyatta Avenue in Nairobi. The African Heritage Band performed there and is credited with launching the international career of the late Ayub Ogada, especially after the success of Kothbiro, a Luo folk song.\n\nWhen it closed down in 2003, it had more than 500 full-time employees, over 50 outlets around the world, and thousands supplying items on consignment basis. The Tuesday African Heritage buying day on the pavement morphed into the Maasai markets, which are now held every day at various locations in the Kenya.\n\nIn 1989, Donovan began building his dream house overlooking the Nairobi National Park. He held fundraising events for causes he felt passionate about \u2014 like the park. It was at his house that I came to know that Nairobi National Park hosted the second-largest wildebeest population after the Maasai Mara Game Reserve.\n\nDonovan had a framed picture he had taken from the top veranda of his house of thousands of wildebeest in the 1990s. That migratory route is a thing of the past now, cut off by the tarmac road and fences.\n\nIt was at Donovan\u2019s house that I saw the Venetian beads used for trade in Africa, with the Millefiori the most coveted. His collection was fascinating, including the royal beads that no commoner could wear from the old City of Benin.\n\nBenin was razed by the British in 1897 and all the palace treasures looted.\n\nOne day I was admiring a beaded collar in his glass cabinet when he said, \u201cIt is made of faience beads.\u201d\n\nHe placed it around my neck and its touch was cool on my skin. The beads were worn by Egyptian pharaohs 4,000 years ago. Fashioned from baked clay, they have since been replaced by cheap imports. Donovan had commissioned an old Egyptian man he had met on his earlier travels through Africa to make the faience bead collar. He then gave me a pair of faience bead earrings \u2014 a treasured gift.\n\nUpheavals\n\nLife was not always kind to Donovan. In the 1980s, the shop on Kenyatta Avenue burnt down, an incident blamed on an electric fault. Donovan was devastated, and even contemplated leaving Kenya.\n\n\u201cI only stayed because of Murumbi,\u201d he said.\n\nThey opened a new shop on Mombasa Road bordering the national park.\n\nIn 2014, two men walked into Donovan\u2019s house to inform him of their mission to build the standard gauge railway that was to pass through his home and those of his neighbours.\n\nDonovan put up a spirited fight with the neighbourhood association and managed to save the houses. When criticised for not allowing the SGR to be built on the land, he answered: \u201cThey are the first line of defence for the park.\u201d\n\nIn an earlier interview with the magazine Architecture Digest, Donovan said, \u201cAlthough I tried to use features from the various architectural forms that enchanted me in my travels in Africa, an equally important reason for my home is to show people how to live with African arts and craft. I think this indigenous artistic and cultural heritage is underappreciated, both in Africa and worldwide. My house is a step toward preservation.\u201d\n\nDonovan suffered ill health as the years went by. He fought to have the Murumbis\u2019 vast collections housed in the Nairobi Gallery, National Archives and the Murumbi Memorial Garden, where the Murumbis are buried.\n\nDonovan had dreams like Murumbi\u2019s: That his house would become an African institute for the arts. Murumbi\u2019s dream was shattered when he saw his house in Nairobi demolished by the political elite, after bequeathing it to the government to have it turned into the African Institute for the Arts.\n\nDonovan died on the morning of December 5 in his sleep at his beloved home at the age of 83.", "articleBodyHtml": "<article>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://www.theeastafrican.co.ke/tea/author-profiles/rupi-mangat-1371438\">More by this Author</a></p>\n\n<p>I met Alan Donovan one morning in 2006 at the Kampala Serena. He was holding an ostrich egg. The door of the lift opened and there he was \u2014 tall with intense, blue eyes. I was on my way to breakfast when I saw him and I blurted, ''I know you! You are Donovan.\u201d</p>\n\n<p>He smiled and said yes.</p>\n\n<p>\u201cSo what are you doing here?\u201d I asked.</p>\n\n<p>He was doing the d\u00e9cor for the hotel with African art from around the continent. Breakfast forgotten, I spent the entire day trailing him around.</p>\n\n<p>I watched him turn the hotel into a veritable African art gallery, placing artefacts in the rooms as he talked fondly about them.</p>\n\n<p>The ostrich egg that he was holding like a child was one of the ancient media of art carved by the desert people of the Kalahari in South Africa. Recent excavations have unearthed more pieces of eggs carved as far back as 60,000 years.</p>\n\n<p>Donovan would later invite me to the African Heritage House and my education on the arts and architecture of Africa began and deepened.

How can they earn more from their skills? Should governments create a fund for them?\n\nInvestment, collaboration and going digital were some of the answers at the just concluded second Intra-African Trade Fair (IATF2021), particularly during discussions at the Creative Africa Nexus (Canex) Summit and Live Theatre Programme.\n\nOrganised by the African Export-Import Bank in collaboration with the African Union and the African Continental Free Trade Area Secretariat, IATF2021 was held at the Durban International Convention Centre, KwaZulu-Natal, South Africa, from November 15 to 21.\n\nThe fair was attended by policy makers, prominent investors, financiers, and thought leaders who discussed challenges including piracy and lack of finance, cross-border collaborations and investment opportunities in their respective clusters in the cultural and creative industries.\n\nUnder the topic Afrobeat \u2013 What\u2019s next for Africa music, panelists, including Oscar \"Oskido\" Mdlongwa, the founder of Kalawa Jazmee (South Africa), explored why Afrobeat, predominantly from West Africa, is successful and how that success can be shared across the continent.\n\nOskido, who was among musicians, producers, distributors at top brands at the gathering of creatives, said there is need for management.\n\n\u201cWe need to have basic knowledge. We lack proper managers to handle artists in terms of training and registering intellectual property. We don\u2019t only need booking agents, but we have to build and invest in proper music ecosystems and value chains, and education.\u201d\n\nHe noted that music had shifted to digital platforms.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s not about printing CDs anymore. It\u2019s not even about getting airplay on radio. One\u2019s music must be marketed and sold online. Streaming services and social media are the new lucrative vehicles. The music business has evolved and up-and-coming artists and old players must be educated about the new technologies.\u201d\n\nAde Awofisayo, head of music for YouTube in sub-Saharan Africa, called for education in how to use digital platforms. He said that if Africans do not use the platforms and leverage their earning potential, their creativity will be repackaged and monetised by third parties.\n\nChief executive of ContentConnect Africa (South Africa) Antos Stella concurred, urging collaboration among musicians to establish an African-grown streaming service that defines African standards and sets African benchmarks for monetising digital platforms. Such an approach would see more artists being exposed and earning better livelihoods.\n\n\u201cAfrican artists are aspiring to become global stars on YouTube, but the pay cheques are not coming to them because of the limitations of digital payment solutions,\" she said.\n\nHer sentiments elicited a response from yet another panelist, Audu Maikori, founder of Chocolate City Entertainment, Nigeria, who said that Africans should think \u201clocal first, global later\u201d as a strategy to empower the music industry.\n\nBold capital investment is required to create a local streaming service as that would benefit struggling artists.\n\nSipho Dlamini, chief executive of Universal Music Group sub-Saharan Africa (South Africa), called for payment gateways for users on streaming platforms that make African music and culture accessible to Africans. Such gateways would help break down the barriers that limit the ability of Africans to download and stream each other\u2019s music.\n\n\u201cMany African musicians don\u2019t have YouTube channels, and other parties are making money off the ignorant artists.

How can they earn more from their skills? Should governments create a fund for them?</p>\n\n<p>Investment, collaboration and going digital were some of the answers at the just concluded second Intra-African Trade Fair (IATF2021), particularly during discussions at the Creative Africa Nexus (Canex) Summit and Live Theatre Programme.</p>\n\n<p>Organised by the African Export-Import Bank in collaboration with the African Union and the African Continental Free Trade Area Secretariat, IATF2021 was held at the Durban International Convention Centre, KwaZulu-Natal, South Africa, from November 15 to 21.</p>\n\n<p>The fair was attended by policy makers, prominent investors, financiers, and thought leaders who discussed challenges including piracy and lack of finance, cross-border collaborations and investment opportunities in their respective clusters in the cultural and creative industries.</p>\n\n<p>Under the topic Afrobeat \u2013 What\u2019s next for Africa music, panelists, including Oscar \"Oskido\" Mdlongwa, the founder of Kalawa Jazmee (South Africa), explored why Afrobeat, predominantly from West Africa, is successful and how that success can be shared across the continent.</p>\n\n<p>Oskido, who was among musicians, producers, distributors at top brands at the gathering of creatives, said there is need for management.</p>\n\n<p>\u201cWe need to have basic knowledge. We lack proper managers to handle artists in terms of training and registering intellectual property. We don\u2019t only need booking agents, but we have to build and invest in proper music ecosystems and value chains, and education.\u201d</p>\n\n<p>He noted that music had shifted to digital platforms.</p>\n\n<p>\u201cIt\u2019s not about printing CDs anymore. It\u2019s not even about getting airplay on radio. One\u2019s music must be marketed and sold online. Streaming services and social media are the new lucrative vehicles. The music business has evolved and up-and-coming artists and old players must be educated about the new technologies.\u201d</p>\n\n<p>Ade Awofisayo, head of music for YouTube in sub-Saharan Africa, called for education in how to use digital platforms. He said that if Africans do not use the platforms and leverage their earning potential, their creativity will be repackaged and monetised by third parties.</p>\n\n<p>Chief executive of ContentConnect Africa (South Africa) Antos Stella concurred, urging collaboration among musicians to establish an African-grown streaming service that defines African standards and sets African benchmarks for monetising digital platforms. Such an approach would see more artists being exposed and earning better livelihoods.</p>\n\n<p>\u201cAfrican artists are aspiring to become global stars on YouTube, but the pay cheques are not coming to them because of the limitations of digital payment solutions,\" she said.</p>\n\n<p>Her sentiments elicited a response from yet another panelist, Audu Maikori, founder of Chocolate City Entertainment, Nigeria, who said that Africans should think \u201clocal first, global later\u201d as a strategy to empower the music industry.</p>\n\n<p>Bold capital investment is required to create a local streaming service as that would benefit struggling artists.</p>\n\n<p>Sipho Dlamini, chief executive of Universal Music Group sub-Saharan Africa (South Africa), called for payment gateways for users on streaming platforms that make African music and culture accessible to Africans. Such gateways would help break down the barriers that limit the ability of Africans to download and stream each other\u2019s music.</p>\n\n<p>\u201cMany African musicians don\u2019t have YouTube channels, and other parties are making money off the ignorant artists. We need quicker payment avenues. African governments should ease the artists\u2019 visa restrictions, and make it easier to transact in different countries and currencies.

"description": "\nSupply constraints due to export bans, patent hoarding and lack of regulatory approval have contributed to low immunisation rates.", "articleBody": "More by this Author\n\nAs the world heads into the third year of the Covid-19 pandemic, health representatives globally are worried that the virus will outpace global effort to vaccinate large portions of the world population by the first half of 2022.\n\nDespite initial commitments from the Covax global vaccine distribution mechanism to ship two billion doses by end of 2021, efforts have fallen short, with only about 1.45 billion doses expected by January.\n\nMultiple factors such as failure to obtain regulatory authorisation, India\u2019s vaccines export ban in April and protracted negotiations with firms such as Moderna and Pfizer have contributed to the supply constraints.\n\nAt the current rate, it appears that neither the African Union\u2019s goal of 60 percent vaccination by 2023 nor the World Health Organisation\u2019s (WHO) projection to hit the year-end target of fully vaccinating 40 per cent will be achieved.\n\nVaccine inequality\n\nVaccine inequality is nothing new. When swine flu broke out in 2009, rich vaccine-producing countries refused to export jabs until domestic needs were met. In 2010, children in Morocco and Algeria missed out on life-saving meningitis vaccines amid a global shortage.\n\nNow African leaders have resolved to ramp up local vaccine manufacturing. A high-level meeting by the Africa Centres for Disease Control and Prevention (Africa CDC) agreed to increase the manufacturing capacity for Covid-19 vaccines to ensure the continent does not lag behind in vaccinating its population.\n\nThe African Union has announced the launch of the Partnership for African Vaccines Manufacturing (Pavm) to enable manufacturing of up to 60 percent of the continent\u2019s vaccine requirements by 2040.\n\n\u201cThe technological transfers that are being negotiated range from fill-and-finish to cater for the emergency and short term needs, to manufacture under license using existing capacity for medium term needs, and finally the establishment of full manufacturing plants in Africa,\u201d said Dr Ahmed Ogwell, the deputy director of the AfricaCDC.\n\nAs of September, there were at least 12 Covid-19 production facilities set up or in the pipeline across six African countries.\n\nIn June the WHO enlisted a team of South African researchers to crack the code for an mRNA Covid-19 vaccine following Moderna and Pfizer\u2019s refusal to share their patent and then teach others around the world to make it. South Africa will be the first of several mRNA hubs, allowing more and more countries to produce vaccines.\n\nPfizer and German firm BioNTech in July announced a partnership with Biovac Institute in Cape Town to produce an mRNA-based Covid-19 jab. The partnership will see the giant pharmaceuticals transfer technology, install equipment and develop manufacturing capability. The first doses will be produced in 2022, the firms announced.\n\nRwanda plant\n\nIn October, BioNTech announced it has signed an agreement with the Rwandan government and Institut Pasteur de Dakar in Senegal to construct the first mRNA vaccine manufacturing facility in Africa starting in mid-2022. The plan is to initially build a production line with an annual capacity of 50 million doses that could be used to make vaccines for such diseases as malaria and tuberculosis as well as for Covid-19, Reuters reported.\n\nThis week Cuba expressed readiness to revive its plans to establish a vaccine manufacturing plant in Zimbabwe, which stalled due to the pandemic.\n\nIn Kenya, President Uhuru Kenyatta officially announced plans to set up a fill-finish vaccine plant known as Kenya Biovax Limited in the next six months.\n\nSpeaking to The EastAfrican, Kenya\u2019s acting Director-General of Health Patrick Amoth said the government, through multi-stakeholder investments will pump in $17.8 million (Sh2 billion).\n\n\u201cOur ultimate goal is to have a plant that will make a vaccine from design to market product,\u201d said Dr Amoth.\n\nFurther, he mentioned that Korea had expressed readiness to support Kenya construct a human vaccine production facility at the Konza Technopolis. Private pharmaceuticals like Dawa Life Sciences are also throwing their hats into the ring with plans to set up a production plant for vaccines or injectables' plant.\u201d said Mwai Ngibuini, head of business development at Dawa Life Sciences in an interview with The EastAfrican.\n\nExports of AstraZeneca\u2019s vaccine doses produced by the Serum Institute of India are expected to restart this month, filling part of the shortfall.\n\n\u201cWe have set the budget, identified the premises, worked out partnerships with successful plants so that we can build a plant that with capabilities to fill-finished to vials, labeled and packaged domestically,\u201d said Dr Amoth, adding that He however declined to name the partners.\n\nFill and finish is the process of filling vials with vaccine and finishing the process of packaging the medicine for distribution.\n\n\"Our vision is for vaccines development and manufacturing to happen on the continent, from R&D, production for the continent and the global market as well.\" he said, adding that \"we are targeting to affordably give people access to expertise and health technology that is currently not available in the country and continent.\"\n\nA meeting in October between health Cabinet Secretary Mutahi Kagwe, Exim Bank of Korea director and senior Korean government officials revealed that the bank has already received approval to support the initiative.\n\n\u201cWe also want to leverage on the partnerships Korea had in Vietnam and Myanmar to see what succeeded and borrow the best practices,\u201d Dr Amoth noted.\n\n\u201cWe have a plan to establish a plant in Zimbabwe for the production of vaccines. That project started before Covid-19 but we stopped because of the pandemic,\u201d Cuban ambassador to Zimbabwe Carmelina Rodriguez announced on November 22, according to local media.\n\nOn November 18, C\u00e9sar Sanz Rodriguez -- Moderna\u2019s vice president of medical affairs for Europe, Middle East and Africa -- in a meeting with African stakeholders was at pains to explain why the biotechnology company has been reluctant to share its patent to allow South African manufacturers to step up their production capacity.\n\nBut even with the hurdles, some countries have begun laying the ground work to develop the continent\u2019s capacity.", "articleBodyHtml": "<article>\n\n<figure><img src=\"data:image/png;base64,iVBORw0KGgoAAAANSUhEUgAAAAEAAAABCAQAAAC1HAwCAAAAC0lEQVR42mNkYAAAAAYAAjCB0C8AAAAASUVORK5CYII=\" alt=\"General Image\" title=\"\" data-cm-responsive-media='[{\"name\":\"landscape_ratio16x9\",\"ratioWidth\":16,\"ratioHeight\":9,\"linksForWidth\":{\"200\":\"/resource/image/1367838/landscape_ratio16x9/200/112/a14bf856bbe85588ee9a71c3dd2d9079/Zy/general-image.jpg\",\"300\":\"/resource/image/1367838/landscape_ratio16x9/300/168/a14bf856bbe85588ee9a71c3dd2d9079/xe/general-image.jpg\",\"400\":\"/resource/image/1367838/landscape_ratio16x9/400/225/a14bf856bbe85588ee9a71c3dd2d9079/tp/general-image.jpg\",\"1160\":\"/resource/image/1367838/landscape_ratio16x9/1160/652/a14bf856bbe85588ee9a71c3dd2d9079/BR/general-image.jpg\"}},{\"name\":\"portrait_ratio2x3\",\"ratioWidth\":2,\"ratioHeight\":3,\"linksForWidth\":{\"200\":\"/resource/image/1367838/portrait_ratio2x3/200/300/7e3082612931b56e9b759be8aa34278a/tG/general-image.jpg\",\"400\":\"/resource/image/1367838/portrait_ratio2x3/400/600/7e3082612931b56e9b759be8aa34278a/Hz/general-image.jpg\",\"768\":\"/resource/image/1367838/portrait_ratio2x3/768/1152/7e3082612931b56e9b759be8aa34278a/ED/general-image.jpg\"}},{\"name\":\"landscape_ratio2x1\",\"ratioWidth\":2,\"ratioHeight\":1,\"linksForWidth\":{\"200\":\"/resource/image/1367838/landscape_ratio2x1/200/100/9d9b6721974677420b161be29871e3de/SM/general-image.jpg\"}},{\"name\":\"landscape_ratio3x2\",\"ratioWidth\":3,\"ratioHeight\":2,\"linksForWidth\":{\"300\":\"/resource/image/1367838/landscape_ratio3x2/300/200/9e5650306d00a9aa4d0272fe9dad630b/EX/general-image.jpg\",\"400\":\"/resource/image/1367838/landscape_ratio3x2/400/267/9e5650306d00a9aa4d0272fe9dad630b/tR/general-image.jpg\",\"768\":\"/resource/image/1367838/landscape_ratio3x2/768/512/9e5650306d00a9aa4d0272fe9dad630b/mX/general-image.jpg\"}},{\"name\":\"portrait_ratio1x1\",\"ratioWidth\":1,\"ratioHeight\":1,\"linksForWidth\":{\"50\":\"/resource/image/1367838/portrait_ratio1x1/50/50/fbf9106d9ad6539a04bf94308c9582ef/Bw/general-image.jpg\",\"60\":\"/resource/image/1367838/portrait_ratio1x1/60/60/fbf9106d9ad6539a04bf94308c9582ef/EF/general-image.jpg\",\"200\":\"/resource/image/1367838/portrait_ratio1x1/200/200/fbf9106d9ad6539a04bf94308c9582ef/nl/general-image.jpg\",\"400\":\"/resource/image/1367838/portrait_ratio1x1/400/400/fbf9106d9ad6539a04bf94308c9582ef/Qj/general-image.jpg\",\"768\":\"/resource/image/1367838/portrait_ratio1x1/768/768/fbf9106d9ad6539a04bf94308c9582ef/sE/general-image.jpg\"}},{\"name\":\"landscape_ratio4x3\",\"ratioWidth\":4,\"ratioHeight\":3,\"linksForWidth\":{\"200\":\"/resource/image/1367838/landscape_ratio4x3/200/150/d36b3dd5115b9a16b14330d50e17e6f5/LQ/general-image.jpg\",\"400\":\"/resource/image/1367838/landscape_ratio4x3/400/300/d36b3dd5115b9a16b14330d50e17e6f5/CT/general-image.jpg\",\"768\":\"/resource/image/1367838/landscape_ratio4x3/768/576/d36b3dd5115b9a16b14330d50e17e6f5/BX/general-image.jpg\"}}]'></figure>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://www.theeastafrican.co.ke/tea/author-profiles/elizabeth-merab-1369394\">More by this Author</a></p>\n\n<p>As the world heads into the third year of the Covid-19 pandemic, health representatives globally are worried that the virus will outpace global effort to vaccinate large portions of the world population by the first half of 2022.</p>\n\n<p>Despite initial commitments from the Covax global vaccine distribution mechanism to ship two billion doses by end of 2021, efforts have fallen short, with only about 1.45 billion doses expected by January.</p>\n\n<p>Multiple factors such as failure to obtain regulatory authorisation, India\u2019s vaccines export ban in April and protracted negotiations with firms such as Moderna and Pfizer have contributed to the supply constraints.</p>\n\n<p>At the current rate, it appears that neither the African Union\u2019s goal of 60 percent vaccination by 2023 nor the World Health Organisation\u2019s (WHO) projection to hit the year-end target of fully vaccinating 40 per cent will be achieved.</p>\n\n<h2>Vaccine inequality</h2>\n\n<p>Vaccine inequality is nothing new.

But the biggest challenge is the mining, oil and gas extraction that pose a threat to livelihoods.\n\nFor instance, in South Africa, mining, oil, and gas extraction threaten coastal communities and ecosystems. While permits are granted for offshore exploration, the resultant water pollution disproportionately impacts Zululand, Mpondoland, Xhosaland, Khoisanland, and Namaqualand communities \u2014 who have historically managed these coastal areas.\n\nEloise Costandius, a consultant, said South Africa and Africa, in general, is no longer in dire need of fossil fuel production or products.\n\n\u201cWe should change our focus to green energy production and infrastructure.

We have amazing human resource, even with the limited resources. Reflecting on what the last two years has taught us, I see we have a continent that is resilient and can actually turn around its fortunes through innovation, and building on its own capacities,\u201d Dr Kiboro said.\n\nThe continent is now facing a pariah status from Western countries over the latest coronavirus variant \u2013 Omicron, even as it battles low vaccine uptake, stifled by poor distribution, and access.\n\n\u201cWe are now meeting in Accra to look at what the two years have taught us. Then, we were told that Africa was going to be wiped out by Covid-19. And here we are, resilient that any other continent. We have survived better than the naysayers,\u201d he said. \u201cWe have risen to the occasion. At the start of the pandemic, only three countries could test for Covid. Now, we have made progress -- all countries can do it.\u201d\n\nIn the last two years, the continent has also witnessed a boom in ideas and innovation as countries tried to work around the fears of the pandemic to keep their economies running and afloat.\n\nDr Kiboro said the continent's innovativeness kept most of the countries open, as young people turned the fear of the pandemic into a positive and found innovative means to help in the public health campaigns run.\n\n\u201cWe witnessed a boom in innovation. Ghana and Rwanda were collecting samples with drones. Uganda had its biggest coffee sales. Kenya\u2019s Revitalise firm, based in Kilifi, became the continent\u2019s largest producer of syringes. In 2020, they did over 70 million syringes. We saw innovation by students in Africa -- from ventilators to hospital beds and such.

We need to influence the direction of the narrative,\" Dr Kiboro said.\n\nThis year\u2019s festival, in its third edition, will be seeking to draw lesson from the last two Kusi festivals held in Rwanda's capital Kigali in 2019, and Kenyan city Kisumu in 2020.\n\n\u201cWe need to purpose to leave this festival with a commitment to do better. For the next two days, we shall have panellists discuss Africa\u2019s infrastructure and the opportunities to improve it. We shall also see discussions touching on Intra African trade, politics of Covid vaccines, vaccination apathy, technology, innovation. All this will be done to enable Africa create African wins in the next century,\u201d Dr Kiboro said.\n\n\u201cThe return of the African diaspora is also an important area of discussion this year, given the huge intellectual and financial capital they bring, which Africa needs to tap.

We need to see our continent take its place in the international community.\u201d\n\nSpeaking at the festival, Wamkele Mene, Secretary General of the African Continental Free Trade Area (AfCFTA) Secretariat, castigated Western countries for turning the continent's biggest public health crisis into a political chess game in the last two weeks.\n\nMr Mene termed the current vaccine politics as modern-day colonialism, and apartheid.\n\n\u201cWhat we are seeing around the world is exactly what the apartheid regime did. These restrictions are imposed because we are Africans. This points now that we must accelerate our ability to manufacture and produce vaccines, generic drugs, to improve public health and position ourselves for industrial development capacity and ensure that we rely less on others to improve our public health.\u201d\n\n\u201cWe are confronting a public health nightmare that has recently become a political crisis in the last 10 days.

"\nPolling, set for December 24, was intended to mark a transition towards peace, but many now fear it could instead reignite civil war.", "articleBody": "By AFP\n\nLibya is to hold its first ever presidential elections late next week, but the lack of a final list of candidates and bitter political divisions have cast doubt on whether they will take place.\n\nPolling, set for December 24, was intended to mark a transition towards peace, but many now fear it could instead reignite civil war.\n\nThe \"elections may do more harm than good in Libya given the deep societal and political fault lines,\" said Jamal Benomar, a former United Nations under-secretary-general.\n\n\"The necessary conditions for free and fair elections are not available, and Libyans are too divided to accept or agree on the results.\"\n\nThe election, part of a United Nations-led peace process, comes after a year of relative calm following a landmark October 2020 ceasefire between eastern and western camps.\n\nA transitional administration took office in March to lead the oil-rich North African country into the polls.\n\nBut despite high hopes for peace, the UN has struggled to overcome deep, complex divisions left by a decade of fighting and foreign intervention since the 2011 NATO-backed uprising that toppled and killed Muammar Gadaffi.\n\nBenomar, who chairs the International Centre for Dialogue Initiatives think tank, warned that fragmented state institutions and a lack of \"unified or legitimate\" security forces were destabilising the country.\n\nAs an array of armed groups hold sway on the ground, few believe that voters will be able to freely cast their ballots.\n\nDivisive candidates\n\nAbout 2.5 million voter registration cards have been collected, but aside from posters urging other Libyans to do likewise, there are few signs in the seaside capital Tripoli that a ballot is approaching.\n\nWith the election authority yet to publish a final list of candidates, campaigning has not officially begun, although some hopefuls are promoting themselves on social media.\n\nThe elections follow months of bitter disputes over their legal basis and who may stand, with several divisive figures in the running.\n\nAmong the most controversial is Khalifa Haftar, a military chief who controls much of eastern and southern Libya.\n\nHe is despised in the country's west following his year-long, ultimately failed assault on Tripoli in 2019-2020.\n\nHis candidacy was made possible by a controversial electoral law signed off by his ally, parliamentary speaker Aguila Saleh, in a process rivals say bypassed due process.\n\nBut for some, his rival Seif al-Islam Kadhafi's candidacy is equally problematic.\n\nThe son of the toppled dictator who ruled Libya with an iron fist for four decades, Seif al-Islam is accused by many -- including International Criminal Court prosecutors -- of war crimes.\n\nAnas El Gomati, director of Libyan think tank the Sadeq Institute, said that \"elections under these legal and political conditions will almost certainly destabilise Libya\".\n\nHe told AFP: \"An election victory by Seif or Haftar would bring war from those who stood against Kadhafi in 2011 or Haftar's assault on Tripoli in 2019.\"\n\nEven interim Prime Minister Abdulhamid Dbeibah, a tycoon who heads the Tripoli-based transitional administration, faces claims his candidacy is illegitimate.\n\nAfter months of legal battles, \"whoever wins, there is a risk that the losers will undermine the winners and say the election wasn't constitutionally valid,\" said Peter Millett, a former UK ambassador to Libya.\n\n'Train crash'\n\nAs if these complexities were not enough, the UN's Libya envoy Jan Kubis quit his post just a month before the poll.\n\nA diplomat in New York, who asked not to be named, said Kubis's insistence on holding the polls on December 24 had caused a \"breakdown\" in his relationship with Secretary-General Antonio

AFP</strong></p>\n\n<p>Libya is to hold its first ever presidential elections late next week, but the lack of a final list of candidates and bitter political divisions have cast doubt on whether they will take place.</p>\n\n<p>Polling, set for December 24, was intended to mark a transition towards peace, but many now fear it could instead reignite civil war.</p>\n\n<p>The \"elections may do more harm than good in Libya given the deep societal and political fault lines,\" said Jamal Benomar, a former United Nations under-secretary-general.</p>\n\n<p>\"The necessary conditions for free and fair elections are not available, and Libyans are too divided to accept or agree on the results.\"</p>\n\n<p>The election, part of a United Nations-led peace process, comes after a year of relative calm following a landmark October 2020 ceasefire between eastern and western camps.</p>\n\n<p>A transitional administration took office in March to lead the oil-rich North African country into the polls.</p>\n\n<p>But despite high hopes for peace, the UN has struggled to overcome deep, complex divisions left by a decade of fighting and foreign intervention since the 2011 NATO-backed uprising that toppled and killed Muammar Gadaffi.</p>\n\n<p>Benomar, who chairs the International Centre for Dialogue Initiatives think tank, warned that fragmented state institutions and a lack of \"unified or legitimate\" security forces were destabilising the country.</p>\n\n<p>As an array of armed groups hold sway on the ground, few believe that voters will be able to freely cast their ballots.</p>\n\n<h2>Divisive candidates</h2>\n\n<p>About 2.5 million voter registration cards have been collected, but aside from posters urging other Libyans to do likewise, there are few signs in the seaside capital Tripoli that a ballot is approaching.</p>\n\n<p>With the election authority yet to publish a final list of candidates, campaigning has not officially begun, although some hopefuls are promoting themselves on social media.</p>\n\n<p>The elections follow months of bitter disputes over their legal basis and who may stand, with several divisive figures in the running.</p>\n\n<p>Among the most controversial is Khalifa Haftar, a military chief who controls much of eastern and southern Libya.</p>\n\n<p>He is despised in the country's west following his year-long, ultimately failed assault on Tripoli in 2019-2020.</p>\n\n<p>His candidacy was made possible by a controversial electoral law signed off by his ally, parliamentary speaker Aguila Saleh, in a process rivals say bypassed due process.</p>\n\n<p>But for some, his rival Seif al-Islam Kadhafi's candidacy is equally problematic.</p>\n\n<p>The son of the toppled dictator who ruled Libya with an iron fist for four decades, Seif al-Islam is accused by many -- including International Criminal Court prosecutors -- of war crimes.</p>\n\n<p>Anas El Gomati, director of Libyan think tank the Sadeq Institute, said that \"elections under these legal and political conditions will almost certainly destabilise Libya\".</p>\n\n<p>He told AFP: \"An election victory by Seif or Haftar would bring war from those who stood against Kadhafi in 2011 or Haftar's assault on Tripoli in 2019.\"</p>\n\n<p>Even interim Prime Minister Abdulhamid Dbeibah, a tycoon who heads the Tripoli-based transitional administration, faces claims his candidacy is illegitimate.</p>\n\n<p>After months of legal battles, \"whoever wins, there is a risk that the losers will undermine the winners and say the election wasn't constitutionally valid,\" said Peter Millett, a former UK ambassador to Libya.</p>\n\n<h2>'Train crash'</h2>\n\n<p>As if these complexities were not enough, the UN's Libya envoy Jan Kubis quit his post just a month before the poll.</p>\n\n<p>A diplomat in New York, who asked not to be named, said Kubis's insistence on holding the polls on December 24 had caused a \"breakdown\" in his relationship with Secretary-General Antonio Guterres, who doubted conditions were ripe.</p>\n\n<p>Kubis had even recognised the contentious September election law. That was \"one of the big criticisms of his tenure\", said Amanda Kadlec, a former member of the UN Panel of Experts on Libya.</p>\n\n<p>To avoid a vacuum, Guterres appointed US diplomat Stephanie Williams, a former acting director of the UN's Libya mission, as \"special adviser\".</p>\n\n<p>Parliamentary speaker Saleh had also changed the electoral timetable to delay legislative polls, keeping himself in charge of the eastern-based parliament even if his ally Haftar were to lose the presidential vote, according to Gomati.</p>\n\n<p>Yet despite the danger of holding the polls, experts warn that postponing them also carries risks.</p>\n\n<p>If Dbeibah stayed in position without a ballot, his eastern rivals could again create their own government to compete with his, Kadlec said.</p>\n\n<p>Millett sees a risk \"that\u00a0Libya is heading for a train crash on December 25 whether elections happen on schedule or not.\"</p>\n\n</article>", "canonicalUrl": "https://www.theeastafrican.co.ke/tea/rest-of-africa/libya-prepares-for-polls-as-doubts-grow-3652412"},{"url": "https://www.theeastafrican.co.ke/tea/kusi-ideas/africa-can-turn-the-negative-impacts-of-illness-build-itself-3270872", "probability": 0.9913517, "headline": "Africa can turn the negative impacts of illness into a chance to build and strengthen itself", "datePublished": "2021-01-27T13:45:00+00:00", "datePublishedRaw": "2021-01-27T13:45:00Z", "dateModified": "2021-01-27T16:10:51+00:00", "dateModifiedRaw": "2021-01-27T16:10:51Z", "author": "NJUGUNA NDUNG\u2019U", "authorsList": ["NJUGUNA NDUNG\u2019U"], "inLanguage": "en", "breadcrumbs": [{"name": "Home", "link": "https://www.theeastafrican.co.ke/tea"}, {"name": "KUSI IDEAS", "link": "https://www.theeastafrican.co.ke/tea/kusi-ideas"}], "mainImage": "https://www.theeastafrican.co.ke/resource/blob/3270962/e98c77fdf362d7c1cd3bdb296f0a9855/masks-data.jpg", "description": "\nThe pandemic has had a devastating effect on African economies.

But on Saturday the elections authority delayed announcing the list, making it even less likely the vote will take place on time.\n\nWhat about the security situation?\n\nAnalysts have warned that the conditions are not in place for a free and fair vote across Libya.\n\nAnd despite a year-long ceasefire, several security incidents and movements of forces have raised fears of a return to conflict.\n\nIn recent weeks, armed men blocked access to a court in Sebha that was examining an appeal against the electoral commission which had rejected the application of Seif al-Islam Kadhafi -- son of the slain dictator.\n\nThey finally withdrew and the court restored his candidacy, but the incident sparked expressions of concern from the interim government and the UN.\n\nInterior Minister Khaled Mazen later warned that the interim government could not guarantee security at polling stations.\n\nHaftar has been accused of seeking to create a military dictatorship, and few believe residents of eastern Libya will be able to safely vote against him.\n\n\"The minimum threshold of infrastructure and safety requirements for a free and fair election are not in place at this point,\" said Amanda Kadlec, former member of a UN panel of experts on Libya.\n\nMoreover, the ballot has already been marred by accusations of fraud. Some voters have complained on social media that they have gone to collect their voter registration cards, only to find that they have already been collected.\n\nWill the results be accepted?\n\nIf the polls do go ahead, there is no guarantee all sides will accept the result.\n\nRivals of each of the three perceived front runners have cast doubts over their candidacies -- and each has armed forces who back their claims.\n\nFew in western Libya would accept a Haftar victory.\n\nSeif al-Islam Kadhafi is wanted by the International Criminal Court for suspected crimes against humanity and his candidacy has been contested in Libyan courts for similar reasons.\n\nAnd before he was appointed interim premier, Abdulhamid Dbeibah had committed not to run -- before finally throwing his hat into the ring after a string of populist moves.\n\nWhat challenges will the next government face?\n\nAny government resulting from the elections will face colossal challenges after four decades of dictatorship and a decade of war.\n\nA key test will be whether they can reunite state institutions, including the central bank, which split in 2014 as a rival administration took power in eastern Libya.\n\nUnifying or disbanding armed forces that were fighting each other until mid-2020 will also pose complex challenges -- especially as some 20,000 foreign fighters remain on Libyan soil.\n\nDrawing up a constitution will also be priority: Libya has been without one since Kadhafi scrapped the last one in 1969, and the lack of such a document has been at the heart of disputes over the current electoral process.\n\nFor ordinary Libyans, the priorities are more mundane: security, revival of the moribund economy, reconstruction of war-ravaged infrastructure and an end to interminable power cuts.\n\nKey to Libya's relations with European powers will be the subject of sub-Saharan African migrants, tens of thousands of whom try to use the country as a launch pad for desperate bids to reach Europe.", "articleBodyHtml": "<article>\n\n<figure><img

At the same point, cases globally were more than 234.6 million, causing nearly 4.8 million deaths.\n\nConsidering that Africa\u2019s population is equivalent to 16.72 percent of the total world population, optimists think the continent dodged a bullet by carrying only 3.58 per cent of the global Covid-19 burden, as it were.\n\nThat, however, is of little comfort to the people who lost their dear ones, and the millions whose lives have been upended or ruined by the economic blow of the pandemic. East Africa\u2019s media have painted a very gloomy picture over the past nine months. Every week newspapers have carried stories of bloodied local, regional or international companies either closing down or shuttering their operations and sending workers home.\n\nTourism, the mainstay of most East African countries\u2019 economies, took a severe hammering. The six-member states of the East Africa Community lost 92 percent of their tourism revenues due to the Covid-19 pandemic, according to the bloc\u2019s secretary general, Peter Mathuki.\n\nTourist arrivals to the region fell from 6.98 million before the pandemic to 2.25 million at present. Although he is optimistic about a full recovery, Dr Mathuki projected that it would happen \u201cwithin a span of less than five years,\u201d in other words, not by this Christmas.\n\nHowever, if we cast our gaze wider, there are many hopeful signs. On December 10 and 11, 2021, the Nation Media Group is convening its very successful pan-African conference, the Kusi Ideas Festival, in the Ghanaian capital Accra, to explore these signs of renewal and recovery.\n\nThis will be the third Kusi Ideas Festival, under the theme \u201cHow Africa Transforms After the Virus\u201d. We see not only renewal and recovery, but also transformation emerging from the virus crisis. For example, there are indications of an increase in urban plot sizes across East Africa as a direct response to disruptions of both global and local supply chains. This has significant long-term implications for the cost of food and deliveries from farms to markets.\n\nThere are also indications of a swing towards organic fertilisers, with all the possibilities that the pivot could hold for a better ecological order in these environmentally challenging times.\n\nAt the wider trade level, Morocco\u2019s Tanger Med Port handled nearly six million containers in 2020, an increase of 23 percent compared to 2019, at a time when some major ports in the world were recording negative growth or glad to see growth of between one to five percent. This, according to Tanger Med officials, was a result of shippers deciding to consolidate rather than stop at three or more ports, to deal with the new risks posed by Covid-19.\n\nWe witnessed a sterling show from Africa Centre for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) in its leadership on a continental response to the pandemic, that gave new credibility to pan-African institutions and way of working.\n\nToday, 41 countries have ratified the African Continental Free Trade Area (AfCFTA), which is working to bring together 55 African countries with a combined population of more than one billion people and a combined GDP of more than $3 trillion. Remarkably, 13 of the 41 ratifications happened during the pandemic, as did indeed the official handover and commissioning of the AfCFTA Secretariat Building in Accra, by President Nana Akufo-Addo on August 17, 2020.\n\nOne of the reasons we are holding Kusi 3 in Accra is the opportunity to be in close proximity to the AfCFTA nerve centre, and because we believe trade and pan-African collaboration are the glue that will heal the Covid-19 wounds.\n\nKusi 3 will look at these transformations and their likely impact. And it will also drill down into a whole range of other sources of energy, innovation centres, and explore the wonderful things the young people of the world\u2019s most youthful continent have created. During the pandemic, for instance, Senegalese-born TikTok star Khaby Lame amassed the second-biggest following of any account on the widely popular social media platform with nearly 120 million \u2014 and helped propel TikTok\u2019s rapid growth on the continent.\n\nIn countries like Uganda, where health insurance was lagging behind car insurance, the pandemic period has for the first time reversed that.\n\nAnd in a game-changing moment for Africa, in a first, the World Health Organisation just recommended a ground-breaking malaria vaccine for children at risk in sub-Saharan Africa and other regions with moderate to high malaria transmission. The recommendation is based on results from an ongoing pilot in Ghana, Kenya and Malawi that has reached more than 800,000 children since 2019.\n\nHaving to contend with the many problems we face daily, Africans often don\u2019t give themselves enough credit for their achievements.

", "articleBody": "More by this Author\n\nAfrican and Asian Muslim-majority states are due to gather for a crucial meeting that will see them issue a joint declaration on the situation in Afghanistan, which has been under Taliban rule since August.\n\nThe meeting, to be hosted by Afghanistan\u2019s neighbour Pakistan next Sunday, is a gathering of the Organisation of the Islamic Cooperation (OIC), a 57-member body headquartered in Jeddah, Saudi Arabia, that includes African and Asian countries that see themselves as the voice of the Muslim world.\n\nThe meeting in Islamabad is of the Ministerial Council, the second highest organ of the OIC, and will discuss the worsening humanitarian situation in Afghanistan.\n\nSomalia, Uganda, Egypt, Libya, Mali, Senegal, Sierra Leone, Tunisia, Mozambique, Cameroon, Burkina Faso, Djibouti, Somalia, Togo, Guinea, Gambia and Mauritania are among countries from Africa expected to send delegations.\n\nSudan, a member of the group, is unlikely to take part as it has no government yet following the October 25 coup that toppled the transitional government of Abdalla Hamdok.\n\nPakistani Foreign Minister Shah Mahmood Qureshi said in a press statement that his country supports Saudi Arabia initiative in its position as chair of the current summit of OIC.\n\n\u201cAfghanistan is one of the founding members of (OIC), and as part of the Islamic nation, we are committed to bonds of brotherhood and friendship with the Afghan people and which are needed more than ever before,\" he said.\n\n\"Afghanistan is currently undergoing a serious humanitarian situation where millions of Afghans, including women and children, are facing precarious conditions due to lack of food, medicine and other basic living supplies, and that the humanitarian crisis in Afghanistan has worsened with the onset of winter.\u201d\n\nUN warnings of a humanitarian crisis facing Afghanistan have increased recently, especially after international aid was suddenly cut off following the Taliban's seizure of power in mid-August.\n\nOnce a proscribed terrorist group, the Taliban seized power after the US and allied forces in NATO left the country in August, leaving behind chaos as civilians also attempted to flee from the probable wrath of the group.\n\nBut the Taliban are unable to access funds because the US has frozen assets owned by Afghanistan on US soil, including cash, and they face a rising humanitarian crisis and poverty.\n\nThe Taliban have also been accused of violating human rights, including barring women and girls from jobs and schools.\n\nObservers believe urgent intervention is needed to address the economic conditions.\n\nSudanese economist Abu al-Gasim Ibrahim told the Nation: \u201cAfter 20 years of the presence of the United States of America in Afghanistan and throughout this period, neither the American forces nor the Afghan government then succeeded in achieving good living standards for Afghan citizens in light of an Afghan economy suffering from problems and big complications.\u201d\n\n\u201c(OIC\u2019s efforts) could be seen as a way to bridge the gap in humanitarian

meeting that will see them issue a joint declaration on the situation in Afghanistan, which has been under Taliban rule since August.</p>\n\n<p>The meeting, to be hosted by Afghanistan\u2019s neighbour Pakistan next Sunday, is a gathering of the Organisation of the Islamic Cooperation (OIC), a 57-member body headquartered in Jeddah, Saudi Arabia, that includes African and Asian countries that see themselves as the voice of the Muslim world.</p>\n\n<p>The meeting in Islamabad is of the Ministerial Council, the second highest organ of the OIC, and will discuss the worsening humanitarian situation in Afghanistan.</p>\n\n<p>Somalia, Uganda, Egypt, Libya, Mali, Senegal, Sierra Leone, Tunisia, Mozambique, Cameroon, Burkina Faso, Djibouti, Somalia, Togo, Guinea, Gambia and Mauritania are among countries from Africa expected to send delegations.</p>\n\n<p>Sudan, a member of the group, is unlikely to take part as it has no government yet following the October 25 coup that toppled the transitional government of Abdalla Hamdok.</p>\n\n<p>Pakistani Foreign Minister Shah Mahmood Qureshi said in a press statement that his country supports Saudi Arabia initiative in its position as chair of the current summit of OIC.</p>\n\n<p>\u201cAfghanistan is one of the founding members of (OIC), and as part of the Islamic nation, we are committed to bonds of brotherhood and friendship with the Afghan people and which are needed more than ever before,\" he said.</p>\n\n<p>\"Afghanistan is currently undergoing a serious humanitarian situation where millions of Afghans, including women and children, are facing precarious conditions due to lack of food, medicine and other basic living supplies, and that the humanitarian crisis in Afghanistan has worsened with the onset of winter.\u201d</p>\n\n<p>UN warnings of a humanitarian crisis facing Afghanistan have increased recently, especially after international aid was suddenly cut off following the Taliban's seizure of power in mid-August.</p>\n\n<p>Once a proscribed terrorist group, the Taliban seized power after the US and allied forces in NATO left the country in August, leaving behind chaos as civilians also attempted to flee from the probable wrath of the group.</p>\n\n<p>But the Taliban are unable to access funds because the US has frozen assets owned by Afghanistan on US soil, including cash, and they face a rising humanitarian crisis and poverty.</p>\n\n<p>The Taliban have also been accused of violating human rights, including barring women and girls from jobs and schools.</p>\n\n<p>Observers believe urgent intervention is needed to address the economic conditions.</p>\n\n<p>Sudanese economist Abu al-Gasim Ibrahim told the Nation: \u201cAfter 20 years of the presence of the United States of America in Afghanistan and throughout this period, neither the American forces nor the Afghan government then succeeded in achieving good living standards for Afghan citizens in light of an Afghan economy suffering from problems and big complications.\u201d</p>\n\n<p>\u201c(OIC\u2019s efforts) could be seen as a way to bridge the gap in humanitarian aid\u201d.</p>\n\n<p>Established on September

It violates the right to freedom of association,\u201d it said,</p>\n\n<p>\u201cThe concern here is that the provision in the proposed Amendment Bill of prohibition from \u201cpolitical involvement\u201d for PVOs is overly broad and vague to has a potential of being misused to target for persecution CSO leaders, pro-democracy activists, human rights defenders and PVOs that may be involved in promoting and protecting civil and political rights.</p>\n\n<p>\u201cThe Bill also gives too much power to the executive to control and interfere with the work of PVOs. It increases the surveillance and monitoring of PVO\u2019s.</p>\n\n<p>\u201cIt seeks to criminalise PVO\u2019s work and human rights defending. This will hinder the operations of PVOs which operate as a watchdog to the government.</p>\n\n<p>\u201cIn a nutshell, the Private Voluntary Organisation Bill is an example of a repressive law, which increases restrictions on freedoms to express, participate, assemble and associate.\u201d</p>\n\n</article>", "canonicalUrl": "https://www.theeastafrican.co.ke/tea/rest-of-africa/mnangagwa-s-new-laws-rile-allies-opposition-3648972"},{"url": "https://www.theeastafrican.co.ke/tea/sports/kenya-michael-olunga-wins-afc-champions-league-golden-boot-3629418", "probability": 0.9779142, "headline": "Kenya's Michael Olunga wins AFC Champions League Golden Boot", "datePublished": "2021-11-24T08:30:00+00:00", "datePublishedRaw": "2021-11-24T08:30:00Z", "dateModified": "2021-11-24T08:57:30+00:00", "dateModifiedRaw": "2021-11-24T08:57:30Z", "author": "GEOFFREY ANENE", "authorsList": ["GEOFFREY ANENE"], "inLanguage": "en", "breadcrumbs": [{"name": "Home", "link": "https://www.theeastafrican.co.ke/tea"}, {"name": "Sports", "link": "https://www.theeastafrican.co.ke/tea/sports"}], "mainImage": "https://www.theeastafrican.co.ke/resource/blob/3629430/b2cd642223656c423e8e4f7f20087d15/olunga-data.jpg", "description": "\nAll his goals came in Group \u201cC\u201d of the West Region held in Jeddah, Saudi Arabia.", "articleBody": "More by this Author\n\nMichael Olunga, the captain of Kenya's national team Harambee Stars, emerged the top scorer in the 2021 Asian Football Confederation (AFC) Champions League after the conclusion of the tournament on Tuesday.\n\nSaudi Arabia's Al Hilal lifted the trophy for the fourth time.\n\nThe centre forward netted nine goals in the 40-team tournament held between April 14 and November 23 this year.

Liberation Front (TPLF), has thrust the country among Africa's top jailers of journalists.\n\nAccording to a report by press freedom lobby, the Committee to Protect Journalists (CPJ), Ethiopia has detained Nation Media Group journalist Tesfa-Alem Tekle and eight other reporters. Some were detained for being seen as reporting unfairly on the government and military activities, while others were viewed as TPLF sympathisers.\n\nMr Tesfa-Alem is among nine journalists detained in the country as at December 1 this year, CPJ indicated on Thursday. He was detained on October 31 this year and was later charged with links to TPLF but was granted bail on November 4. He remains detained incognito in Ethiopia.\n\nLast week, Nation Media Group petitioned the Ethiopian government to provide information on his whereabouts.\n\nYet, globally, there are many other cases of journalists\u2019 detention.\n\nIn its annual prison census report published on Thursday, the New York-based advocacy group said the number of journalists jailed for their work in 2021 reached a global high.
