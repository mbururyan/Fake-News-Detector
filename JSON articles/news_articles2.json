His baby mama, Dotty Ciku is also his cousin.\n\nThe story of baby Abby was brought to the world through Kabi\u2019s cousin, Ruth who lives in the USA. She shared the tea with blogger Edgar Obare who then spilt it to his followers.\n\nKabi Wa Jesus and his wife Milly then released a video denying having a child out of wedlock. He termed Ciku his cousin and Abby his niece. Technically, his statement was accurate. He only omitted some important information in the video.\n\nA few days later, the social media influencer demanded for a DNA test to find out paternity. Fans heavily criticized the move especially after the results confirmed he was the father to Abby.\n\nIt was a 99.9% match. The two parties involved lawyers to streamline the child support arrangements. Abby was already in one of the prestigious private schools in Nairobi.\n\nAccording to Kabi, he paid the child\u2019s PP2 third term fees which was KES 60000.
