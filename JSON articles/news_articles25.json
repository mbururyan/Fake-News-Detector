This includes washing our hands, coughing into our elbows, avoiding touching our faces, staying home if we\u2019re feeling sick and social distancing.\n\nWhat does social distancing mean?\nSocial distancing is the practice of purposefully reducing close contact between people. This includes: remaining out of \u201ccongregate settings\u201d as much as possible, avoiding mass gatherings and maintaining distance of about 6 feet from others when possible. So actually it is physical distancing and using other means to continue social contact.

While physical social distancing is important for our health, so is social interaction \u2013 trying alternative ways to stay connected is a good way to take care of your emotional health.\n\nHow important is social distancing in averting the spread of COVID-19?\nSocial distancing is crucial for preventing the spread of contagious illnesses such as COVID-19. This virus can spread by coughing, sneezing and close contact. By minimizing the amount of close contact we have with others, we reduce our chances of catching the virus and spreading it to our loved ones and within our community.\n\nSocial distancing is important for all of us, but those of us who are at a higher risk of serious complications caused by COVID-19 should be especially cautious about social distancing. People who are at high risk of complications include adults greater than 65 years of age, people who have serious chronic medical conditions like heart disease, diabetes and lung disease. If there are high surges in the number of COVID-19 cases all at once, health care systems and resources could potentially become overwhelmed. Efforts that help stop COVID-19 from spreading rapidly \u2013 like social distancing \u2013 help keep the number of people who are sick at one time as low as possible.\n\nWhat is the best time to practice social distancing?\nThe best time to begin social distancing is before an illness like COVID-19 becomes widespread throughout your community. At the workplace when possible, keeping about 3 feet of distance between yourself and others is key. It\u2019s also important to practice other preventative measures such as washing hands, avoiding touching your face, coughing into your elbow and staying home if you feel sick. Depending on your job and your community\u2019s situation, working from home may be an option.\n\nHow long should those exposed to the virus self-quarantine?\nPeople who have been exposed to the SARS CoV 2 and who are at risk for coming down with COVID-19 might practice self-quarantine. Self-quarantine lasts 14 days. Two weeks provides enough time for them to know whether or not they will become ill and be contagious to other people.\n\nYou might be asked to practice self-quarantine if you have recently returned from travelling to a part of the country or the world where COVID-19 is spreading rapidly, or if you have knowingly been exposed to an infected person.\n\nWhat does self-quarantine involve?\n\nUsing standard hygiene and washing hands frequently\nNot sharing things like towels and utensils\nStaying at home\nNot having visitors\nStaying at least 6 feet away from other people in your household\n\nWhom should be isolated?\n\nFor people who are confirmed to have COVID-19, isolation is appropriate.

Isolation can take place at home or at a hospital or care facility. Special personal protective equipment will be used to care for these patients in health care settings.

Africa has a particular vulnerability because so many people work in the informal sector. In an interview with Moina Spooner from The Conversation Africa, Njeri Kinyanjui explains how this could unfold for Kenya\u2019s informal labourers and whether there\u2019s anything that can be done to support them.\n\nHow many people in Kenya\u2019s workforce are informal workers and what type of work do they do?\n\nThe informal sector thrives in Kenyan rural and urban centres. According to 2015 estimates, there were 11.8 million people employed in the informal economy, against 2.4 million working in the formal sector. By 2018 the informal sector accounted for 83.6 percent of total employment.\n\nBut we can\u2019t be sure of these numbers. There are no accurate statistics on how many people work in the informal economy. The figures are estimates which governments and international development organisations reach by excluding workers employed in the modern formal sector and those in small-scale farming. The methodology is in line with what multilateral agencies such as the World Bank and International Monetary Fund recommend.\n\nThere are many different categories of workers in the informal sector. And, worryingly, despite the huge number of people in this labour force, the earnings differentials between the formal and informal sectors are significant. Entry-level staff in the formal sector earn between Sh10,001 and Sh50,000 (US$100-$500) a month. Those in the informal sector typically earn a monthly income of between Sh5,000 and Sh25,000 (US$50-$250).\n\nThere are those who are self-employed and work for themselves. These people \u2013 for instance tailors or welders \u2013 then hire others on weekly or monthly contracts.\n\nThen there are those who will take up any job that may arise. For instance, house cleaners or porters.\n\nSome informal workers are trainees who are learning on the job or family members who are helping a family business by overseeing accounts or running errands.\n\nThe informal sector is typically viewed as a stopgap measure where people subsist while they wait for jobs in the formal sector. For these reasons, the sector is neglected by government policies at the local level and by development financiers at the global level.\n\nBut, aside from job creation, it\u2019s hugely important to the country\u2019s economy and many households depend on the informal sector. For instance, a lot of vehicle repair and metal work takes place in the informal sector. And the fresh vegetable trade in Kenya is largely informal and unregulated.\n\nWhat are the main challenges they face because of this pandemic?\n\nLike any other businesses, informal sector business will end up with a reduction in customers because of the pandemic. The government is forced to implement quarantines and stay-at-home orders which will have negative consequences for spending in shopping malls, markets and restaurants.\n\nFor instance, customers will avoid crowded markets like Gikomba, Kariakoor and Wakulima \u2013 the biggest informal markets in Nairobi. The demand for their goods will decline and stocked goods may go to waste. Those making school boxes, suitcases that children use for school, or school uniforms may be affected by the closure of schools.\n\nThe businesses that supply the informal sector could, depending how long the measures last, run out of supplies. That will increase the cost of goods. This will affect the cash flow that businesses have.\n\nTravel time to and from work will be affected if public transport is disrupted during the pandemic. This may also mean increased transport costs or delays in getting to work.\n\nThose with children will be affected by school closure because there will be nobody to supervise their children at home. During my fieldwork studies and visits to markets, I observed that young market women usually take their children to informal daycare centres. If these close due to the pandemic, it means they cannot go to the market every day. Those who take their children with them to their workplaces may now be too concerned for their children\u2019s safety.\n\nInformal workers will also not be able to take many of the precautions that health authorities suggest, such as social distancing, hand washing or self-isolation.\n\nSocial distancing between workers in informal markets may be difficult because of crowding. For instance, in markets, people work close to each other and don\u2019t have walls separating them. The same can be found in other informal sectors like in public \u201cmatatu\u201d transport, vehicle repair and metal work.\n\nMaintaining hygiene by handwashing with soap and water may also be a problem because there aren\u2019t any facilities. For example in my research, I\u2019ve not seen any water points in Githurai and Ruiru markets. I think this will apply to most of the other markets.\n\nWorking from home is also difficult. Most informal workers live in informal settlements in single rooms or bedsitters. They do not have enough space to work from. For others, their jobs require them to be on-site, where they\u2019re in contact with their customers. The informal economy operates in agglomerations in different parts of the city. In Kenya these are known as jua kali (hot sun) sites.\n\nIs there anything that can be done to support them?\n\nThere is a lot that can be done to support informal workers.\n\nIn light of this pandemic, because many informal workers are in contact with large numbers of people, they should be provided with masks to protect themselves and others. Water points should also be set up in markets and other informal sector clusters.\n\nLonger-term, the pandemic highlights the need for government and urban planners to plan cities with building designs that cater for traders, artisans and peasants. These facilities should include adequate room size for work, storage and display. There should also be a good supply of clean water, electricity and garbage collection. And there should be facilities that allow traders to access the internet.", "articleBodyHtml": "<article>\n\n<p><em>COVID-19 is going to have a devastating impact on economies.

And the fresh vegetable trade in Kenya is largely informal and unregulated.</p>\n\n<p><strong>What are the main challenges they face because of this pandemic?</strong></p>\n\n<p>Like any other businesses, informal sector business will end up with a reduction in customers because of the pandemic. The government is forced to implement quarantines and stay-at-home orders which will have negative consequences for spending in shopping malls, markets and restaurants.</p>\n\n<p>For instance, customers will avoid crowded markets like Gikomba, Kariakoor and Wakulima \u2013 the biggest informal markets in Nairobi. The demand for their goods will decline and stocked goods may go to waste. Those making school boxes, suitcases that children use for school, or school uniforms may be affected by the closure of schools.</p>\n\n<p>The businesses that supply the informal sector could, depending how long the measures last, run out of supplies. That will increase the cost of goods. This will affect the cash flow that businesses have.</p>\n\n<p>Travel time to and from work will be affected if public transport is disrupted during the pandemic. This may also mean increased transport costs or delays in getting to work.</p>\n\n<p>Those with children will be affected by school closure because there will be nobody to supervise their children at home. During my fieldwork studies and visits to markets, I observed that young market women usually take their children to informal daycare centres. If these close due to the pandemic, it means they cannot go to the market every day. Those who take their children with them to their workplaces may now be too concerned for their children\u2019s safety.</p>\n\n<p>Informal workers will also not be able to take many of the precautions that health authorities suggest, such as social distancing, hand washing or self-isolation.</p>\n\n<p>Social distancing between workers in informal markets may be difficult because of crowding. For instance, in markets, people work close to each other and don\u2019t have walls separating them. The same can be found in other informal sectors like in public \u201cmatatu\u201d transport, vehicle repair and metal work.</p>\n\n<p>Maintaining hygiene by handwashing with soap and water may also be a problem because there aren\u2019t any facilities. For example in my research, I\u2019ve not seen any water points in Githurai and Ruiru markets. I think this will apply to most of the other markets.</p>\n\n<p>Working from home is also difficult. Most informal workers live in informal settlements in single rooms or bedsitters. They do not have enough space to work from. For others, their jobs require them to be on-site, where they\u2019re in contact with their customers. The informal economy operates in agglomerations in different parts of the city. In Kenya these are known as <em>jua kali</em> (hot sun) sites.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Is there anything that can be done to support them?</strong></p>\n\n<p>There is a lot that can be done to support informal workers.</p>\n\n<p>In light of this pandemic, because many informal workers are in contact with large numbers of people, they should be provided with masks to protect themselves and others. Water points should also be set up in markets and other informal sector clusters.</p>\n\n<p>Longer-term, the pandemic highlights the need for government and urban planners to plan cities with building designs that cater for traders, artisans and peasants. These facilities should include adequate room size for work, storage and display. There should also be a good supply of clean water, electricity and garbage collection. And there should be facilities that allow traders to access the internet.</p>\n\n</article>", "canonicalUrl": "https://nairobinews.nation.co.ke/how-the-covid-19-pandemic-will-affect-informal-workers-in-kenya/"},{"url": "https://nairobinews.nation.co.ke/photos/government-clears-deceased-doctors-medical-bill/", "probability": 0.99428236, "headline": "Government clears deceased doctor\u2019s medical bill", "datePublished": "2020-12-11T00:00:00", "datePublishedRaw": "December 11th, 2020", "author": "Amina Wako", "authorsList": ["Amina Wako"], "inLanguage": "en", "mainImage": "https://nairobinews.nation.co.ke/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/Dr-Stephen-Mogusu.jpg", "images": ["https://nairobinews.nation.co.ke/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/Dr-Stephen-Mogusu-550x405.jpg", "https://nairobinews.nation.co.ke/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/Cyril-Ramaphosa-150x150.jpeg"], "description": "News,Gossip,Sports and Entertainment from Nairobi.", "articleBody": "The government has cleared Stephen Mogusu\u2019s hospital bill, clearing the way for the deceased doctor\u2019s family to organize his final send-off tentatively planned for Friday.\n\nA letter from the Kenyatta University Teaching Referral and Research Hospital, where the deceased was admitted before he succumbed to Covid-19 related complications, confirmed the bill had been cleared.\n\nThe letter also confirmed the deceased had accrued an Sh.204,618 bill, dispelling earlier reports it had was about a million shillings.\n\n\u201cA clearance letter was issued to the wife in order to proceed and finish processing of the burial permit at the farewell home.

There\u2019s a close relationship between the two. About 60 percent of TB patients are also HIV-positive. The novel coronavirus (Sars-CoV-2) is likely to be of particular concern for communities with high rates of TB and HIV. Sars-CoV-2 and its resulting disease (COVID-19) haven\u2019t been fully researched and understood yet. But speculation based on the behaviour of other viruses and chronic illnesses raises concerns that HIV and TB patients may have a higher risk of developing severe disease. Emily Wong answers some questions.\n\nSARS-COV-2\u2019s primary target is the lungs where it causes inflammation in the delicate tissues that usually allow oxygen to transfer into blood. In mild cases, COVID-19 can just cause a cough, but in severe cases the lungs can fill with inflammation and fluid making it very difficult for them to provide adequate oxygen to the rest of the body. In people who are otherwise healthy, most cases of COVID-19 are mild or moderate.\n\nAt this time, I\u2019m not aware of any data that directly address whether TB makes people more susceptible to COVID-19. But from the Chinese experience, we have seen that people with chronic lung disease are more likely to have increased severity of COVID-19. On that basis, we are concerned that people with undiagnosed active TB, or people currently undergoing treatment for TB, may have increased risk of developing more severe COVID-19 disease if they become infected with SARS-COV-2.\n\nThere is also increasing recognition that post-TB chronic lung disease can be an important long-term consequence of TB. We are concerned that this could also affect COVID-19 severity. After TB, people can get bronchiectasis \u2013 chronic damage to the airways of the lung. This can predispose them to other lung infections. Another lung condition \u2013 chronic obstructive pulmonary disease \u2013 can be caused by tobacco use or by the changes left in the lung after TB.\n\nEven though there\u2019s no data about the effect of post-TB lung disease on COVID-19 at this point, we are concerned that people who have had TB in the past \u2013 and have been left with some lung damage \u2013 may have a more difficult and severe time with COVID-19.\n\nWhat about people infected with HIV?\n\nThere is also very little data to guide us here. But we know that in general HIV infection has profound effects on lung health and immunity. This is why HIV infection increases susceptibility to both Mycobacterium Tuberculosis (Mtb) \u2013 the bacterium that causes TB \u2013 infection and TB disease. We are therefore concerned that HIV infection may also affect SARS-COV-2 infection and COVID-19 severity.\n\nBut most experts think that people who are on antiretroviral therapy and whose viral loads are suppressed will probably have a better time with COVID-19 than people who aren\u2019t. It is very important that people keep taking their HIV medications throughout any disruptions caused by the current COVID-19 epidemic.\n\nWhat will the impact of the SARS-COV-2 epidemic be on TB and HIV services in South Africa?\n\nThis is a major concern. Even countries with better resourced national health systems have rapidly become overwhelmed as the COVID-19 epidemic hits.\n\nSouth Africa has the world\u2019s largest antiretroviral programme. Huge progress has been made. Even in KwaZulu-Natal, the epicentre of the HIV epidemic in South Africa, new HIV infection rates have been dropping. This is because of tremendous efforts to test people and to put people on antiretroviral treatment in a sustained way. Other factors have included national programmes like voluntary medical male circumcision.\n\nThe country has also started to see a decline in TB rates. We think this is related to improvements in the HIV treatment coverage. This is good news. But it\u2019s the result of massive public health programmes that have taken a huge amount of time and effort to set up and optimise. And they\u2019re still challenged by shortages of human and system resources.\n\nWe are very concerned about the impact that COVID-19 epidemic could have on HIV and TB services.\n\nThought is already going into how to try to maintain these critical HIV and TB services. In light of an impending health crisis, attention is on how to maintain sustained access to HIV and TB care. The President\u2019s Emergency Plan for AIDS Relief (PEPFAR) and the South African HIV Clinicians Society are trying to address this. For example, they are urging the health system to make six months of antiretrovirals available to people to save them from having to visit their clinics every month.\n\nAre there extra precautions that individuals with TB and TB/HIV can take?\n\nIt\u2019s very important that people ensure a supply of their HIV and TB medications and take them regularly.\n\nAt this point all South Africans should be heeding the call made by the President to focus on the basic hygiene interventions such as frequent hand-washing as well as implementing social distancing to the maximum extent. That means avoiding contact with groups of people outside of households, and staying home strictly.\n\nAll of these measures are extremely important, whether someone is personally at higher risk of severe infection, or for people who may not personally be at risk of more severe disease but may have a family member who\u2019s older or HIV-positive or a neighbour who falls into any of those categories.\n\nAt this point the national recommendations apply to everyone. All South Africans need to take them very, very seriously because millions of people are immuno-supressed due to HIV or have some lung compromise due to prior TB infection.\n\nThe fact that South Africa has robust vaccine trial infrastructure for both TB and HIV is undoubtedly to its advantage when it comes to thinking about COVID-19 vaccine development. There are already candidate COVID-19 vaccines in human testing. The company Moderna in collaboration with the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases in the US have started clinical trials of an mRNA vaccine candidate. Other candidates are also under development. When these are ready for larger scale human testing, the global scientific community will almost certainly use existing vaccine trial networks to do this testing. Because of both HIV and TB research efforts to date, South Africa is very well represented.", "articleBodyHtml": "<article>\n\n<p><em>Tuberculosis (TB) and HIV pose a significant burden on South Africa\u2019s health system. There\u2019s a close relationship between the two. About 60 percent\u00a0of TB patients are also HIV-positive. The novel coronavirus (Sars-CoV-2) is likely to be of particular concern for communities with high rates of TB and HIV. Sars-CoV-2 and its resulting disease (COVID-19) haven\u2019t been fully researched and understood yet. But speculation based on the behaviour of other viruses and chronic illnesses raises concerns that HIV and TB patients may have a higher risk of developing severe disease. Emily Wong answers some questions.</em></p>\n\n<p>SARS-COV-2\u2019s primary target is the lungs where it causes inflammation in the delicate tissues that usually allow oxygen to transfer into blood. In mild cases, COVID-19 can just cause a cough, but in severe cases the lungs can fill with inflammation and fluid making it very difficult for them to provide adequate oxygen to the rest of the body. In people who are otherwise healthy, most cases of COVID-19 are mild or moderate.</p>\n\n<p>At this time, I\u2019m not aware of any data that directly address whether TB makes people more susceptible to COVID-19. But from the Chinese experience, we have seen that people with chronic lung disease are more likely to have increased severity of COVID-19. On that basis, we are concerned that people with undiagnosed active TB, or people currently undergoing treatment for TB, may have increased risk of developing more severe COVID-19 disease if they become infected with SARS-COV-2.</p>\n\n<p>There is also increasing recognition that post-TB chronic lung disease can be an important long-term consequence of TB. We are concerned that this could also affect COVID-19 severity. After TB, people can get bronchiectasis \u2013 chronic damage to the airways of the lung. This can predispose them to other lung infections. Another lung condition \u2013 chronic obstructive pulmonary disease \u2013 can be caused by tobacco use or by the changes left in the lung after TB.</p>\n\n<p>Even though there\u2019s no data about the effect of post-TB lung disease on COVID-19 at this point, we are concerned that people who have had TB in the past \u2013 and have been left with some lung damage \u2013 may have a more difficult and severe time with COVID-19.</p>\n\n<p><strong>What about people infected with HIV?</strong></p>\n\n<p>There is also very little data to guide us here. But we know that in general HIV infection has profound effects on lung health and immunity. This is why HIV infection increases susceptibility to both Mycobacterium Tuberculosis (Mtb) \u2013 the bacterium that causes TB \u2013 infection and TB disease. We are therefore concerned that HIV infection may also affect SARS-COV-2 infection and COVID-19 severity.</p>\n\n<p>But most experts think that people who are on antiretroviral therapy and whose viral loads are suppressed will probably have a better time with COVID-19 than people who aren\u2019t.

Central Business District (CBD) will soon get underway.\n\nThe Kenya Urban Roads Authority (Kura) said the project, estimated to cost Sh2.9 billion, will commence early next year and is expected to be completed in 2023.\n\nThe project will involve the construction of a viaduct at Valley Road/Kenyatta Avenue from Integrity Centre to Serena Hotel.\n\nViaduct is a type of long bridge or series of bridges, usually supported by a series of arches or on spans between tall towers.\n\nThere will also be an interchange at Ngong/Nyerere Road and an overpass at Upper Hill/Haile Selassie and associated road networks from Milimani Law Courts to Lower Hill Road.\n\nState House road will be refurbished while Nyerere Road will be turned into a dual carriage way.\n\nDuring a draft presentation of the construction work, resident engineer Benjamin Asin said the project will be fully funded by the National Treasury.\n\nAsin said two elevated carriage ways will be erected; one from Integrity Centre to

RNA viruses have been traditionally named after their location of discovery, so the initial designation was Wuhan coronavirus. However, no-one wants it named after their place, so now the agreed on naming of the disease is COVID-19 (COronavirus VIrus Disease-2019) and the virus is coronavirus SARS-CoV-2. The sequence of the virus was released in January and made it clear that this virus is from a bat and related to SARS and MERS, but more closely to SARS; thus, SARS is part of the name. The other bat coronaviruses came to humans via another mammal (civet for SARS and camel for MERS) and that is also suspected for the new virus. The sequence also means that the conspiracy hypothesis about this being a lab-adapted virus are false. It also means that fish or snakes cannot be the intermediate hosts.\n\nHow likely is it that the virus will reach Kenya?\nAs is commonly said, microbes don\u2019t need visas. Despite the travel restrictions, the coronavirus has spread to multiple continents, so it unlikely that travel restrictions will prevent the infection from coming to other parts of the world. In view of the degree of secondary transmission in a number of countries outside China, the major question now is when rather than whether.\n\nWhat are the symptoms of COVID-19?\n\nThe two main symptoms of COVID-19 are fever and cough. The initial case definition also included shortness of breath, but that is true only for those who are more seriously ill. Runny nose and sore throat are very uncommon, so their presence suggests a different virus.\n\nHow does SARS CoV-2 (COVID-19) spread?\nSARS CoV-2 spreads through droplets which are released when people sneeze or cough. These droplets can only travel up to one meter and cause infection they contact the mucous membranes of the mouth, nose or eyes. Spread from contaminated surfaces may also occur, but plays a lesser role.\n\nWhy doesn\u2019t a mask work for protection?\n\nThe virus leaves the other person in the form of respiratory droplets. They cause infection when they land on mucous membranes (mouth, eyes). They may land directly there or they may do it indirectly. That could be from those droplets getting on the infected person\u2019s hand; he then touches you and you touch your mouth or eyes. Or he may cough on you and then you rub your eyes. Or it may be droplets that land on a counter next to you and then you touch it and then your face. The virus doesn\u2019t survive a long time on an inanimate object.\n\nThe above means that the only thing the mask prevents is the virus coming in a droplet and landing on your mouth. It may make a bit of difference but there are so many exposures it doesn\u2019t prevent that overall it isn\u2019t worth using for routine purposes. For people taking care of COVID-19 patients, they wear a surgical mask and if doing high-risk procedures, they wear an N95.\n\nHow long is the incubation period for COVID-19?\n\nThe incubation period is the time between catching the virus and when the symptoms of the disease start appearing. The average is about 5 days and ranges from 2 to 12 days in most cases.\n\nHow do I know if I have COVID-19 and not regular cold or flu?\n\nThe only way to know if you suffer from COVID-19 is through a special lab test called PCR. The PCR test is currently available through the Ministry of Health and soon it will be done at AKUHN. However, COVID-19, being a lower respiratory illness does not typically have a runny nose or sore throat.\n\nNo. COVID-19 is caused by a virus and antibiotics only work on bacterial infections.\n\nIs there any specific treatment for COVID-19?\n\nThere is no treatment for COVID-19 yet. The disease is treated symptomatically, which means the symptoms (such as fever and cough) are treated rather than the disease itself.\n\nHow serious is COVID-19?\n\nCOVID-19 is usually a mild to moderate respiratory (lung) infection. In the elderly or those who are immunocompromised or have other chronic diseases, it may lead to a severe pneumonia and can be fatal. Children and young adults rarely develop serious disease.\n\nWhat are the mortality rates?\nSo far, the mortality rates in China have been 2-3% but the true number may be higher or lower and will certainly depend on the level of care provided by the hospital. The mortality was higher in Wuhan than other places, possibly because the health system there was overwhelmed. Most of the people hospitalized in China have been over 40 (including none under 15) and half have had other medical illnesses such as diabetes, heart disease or stroke, making them more vulnerable. So far, 1.5% of those outside China have died. In fact, within China, the mortality has dropped to 0.7%.\n\nWhat is the risk for health care workers?\n\nThere is definitely a risk but the magnitude of the risk is lower than initially thought. In China, the majority of HCW cases were actually acquired within their own households.\n\nHow are COVID-19 cases being transmitted in countries with many cases?\n\nIn China, about 80% of cases have been acquired through household contact and nearly all the others by close contacts of other types.\n\nIs there anything I should do before it arrives?\n\nThe short answer is to do common sense things that will keep you in good health. People are frequently changing their diets, buying respiratory masks, etc. None of these things will help at this time.\n\nHow can I reduce the risk of getting coronavirus from infected humans?\n\nIt is likely that the transmission of coronavirus is similar to that of other respiratory viruses such as influenza. That means that the infection occurs from contact with respiratory secretions of someone who is infected. That can be from directly touching the infected person or from being coughed on. Then, the droplets from the person coughing land on you and establish infection. That means that the most important thing you can do is proper hand hygiene, either washing with soap and water or using an alcohol-based hand sanitizer when you have contact with someone who might have a respiratory illness. It is very unlikely that walking around with a mask (as many are doing elsewhere) will make any difference.\n\nWill a normal flu shot help me avoid the worst symptoms?\n\nThe flu shot is for preventing infection from influenza and will not prevent coronavirus infection. However, the illness caused by influenza is similar to the coronavirus infection, so if influenza is prevented, there is less chance of suspecting that you have the coronavirus when in fact, it is influenza.\n\nIf I catch the virus what is the standard treatment?\n\nSo far, there is not a specific medication that treats the virus (as is true for most viruses). However, with good supportive care nearly everyone can survive. That includes oxygen when needed and even a ventilator for those who are really sick.\n\nI have a bad cough and would normally not see a doctor for it\u2014but with this going on, should I go?\n\nAs of the 9th of March, we have not had any cases of the coronavirus infection in Kenya. That means that for people without recent international travel, any cough is from another cause, usually a virus. If you are not sick enough to require medical attention, there are two advantages to not going in. First, by staying at home, you will spread the virus to fewer people. Second, it is common that doctors give antibiotics even when they won\u2019t help, such as for a viral respiratory infection, so you can save yourself from an unnecessary antibiotic.\n\nGiven that the virus originated from animals should I stay away from meat and animal products? Should I worry how I handle animals?\nThe 2019-nCoV coronavirus is originally a bat virus but likely was initially transmitted to humans via another mammal. However, now all the transmission is human to human, so animal contact will not make any difference for this virus. However, do note that there are other infections that can be acquired from animals. For example, there is anthrax from dead cattle who are then butchered. There is brucellosis from goats, sheep and other animals, and Salmonella from chickens and eggs. And don\u2019t forget dogs; if they haven\u2019t been immunized, they can transmit rabies when they bite. That means we must be careful with animals, but it won\u2019t affect our getting the coronavirus.\n\nWhat is Aga Khan University hospital doing for preparation?\n\nIf patients come with a potentially contagious illness they will be screened on entry to the facility and when necessary, appropriate precautions will be used. This includes things ranging from TB to cholera to influenza. That same screening process will identify people who might have the coronavirus. In that case, they will be given a surgical mask and will be taken to an individual room to keep them from placing others at risk. If they require hospitalization, whether a regular room or intensive care, they will be placed in an individual room with proper ventilation.\n\nPatients with COVID-19 will receive the level of care that is required for their illness, including intensive care treatment and advanced medical treatment when needed, such as a breathing mechanical ventilation or kidney dialysis.\n\nFirst, those do not truly require medical attention should stay home. Those who do need medical attention should come to A&E where they will be triaged to room 18 for evaluation. The team there will evaluate the patient quickly and decide between discharge, admission to ward level (third floor), HDU or ICU. We anticipate that with the physical exam and pulse ox, the disposition can be done for most patients. Some may require blood gases or chest x-ray; these are also available in A&E.", "articleBodyHtml": "<article>\n\n<p><strong>The name and origin of the virus</strong></p>\n\n<p>The name of the virus has rapidly evolved since the first cases in early December 2019 and the recognition that it was a new virus in late December.

The average is about 5 days and ranges from 2 to 12 days in most cases.</p>\n\n<p><strong>How do I know if I have COVID-19 and not regular cold or flu?</strong></p>\n\n<p>The only way to know if you suffer from COVID-19 is through a special lab test called PCR. The PCR test is currently available through the Ministry of Health and soon it will be done at AKUHN. However, COVID-19, being a lower respiratory illness does not typically have a runny nose or sore throat.</p>\n\n<p>No. COVID-19 is caused by a virus and antibiotics only work on bacterial infections.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Is there any specific treatment for COVID-19?</strong></p>\n\n<p>There is no treatment for COVID-19 yet. The disease is treated symptomatically, which means the symptoms (such as fever and cough) are treated rather than the disease itself.</p>\n\n<p><strong>How serious is COVID-19?</strong></p>\n\n<p>COVID-19 is usually a mild to moderate respiratory (lung) infection. In the elderly or those who are immunocompromised or have other chronic diseases, it may lead to a severe pneumonia and can be fatal. Children and young adults rarely develop serious disease.</p>\n\n<p><strong>What are the mortality rates?</strong><br>\nSo far, the mortality rates in China have been 2-3% but the true number may be higher or lower and will certainly depend on the level of care provided by the hospital. The mortality was higher in Wuhan than other places, possibly because the health system there was overwhelmed. Most of the people hospitalized in China have been over 40 (including none under 15) and half have had other medical illnesses such as diabetes, heart disease or stroke, making them more vulnerable. So far, 1.5% of those outside China have died. In fact, within China, the mortality has dropped to 0.7%.</p>\n\n<p><strong>What is the risk for health care workers?</strong></p>\n\n<p>There is definitely a risk but the magnitude of the risk is lower than initially thought. In China, the majority of HCW cases were actually acquired within their own households.</p>\n\n<p><strong>How are COVID-19 cases being transmitted in countries with many cases?</strong></p>\n\n<p>In China, about 80% of cases have been acquired through household contact and nearly all the others by close contacts of other types.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Is there anything I should do before it arrives?</strong></p>\n\n<p>The short answer is to do common sense things that will keep you in good health. People are frequently changing their diets, buying respiratory masks, etc. None of these things will help at this time.</p>\n\n<p><strong>How can I reduce the risk of getting coronavirus from infected humans?</strong></p>\n\n<p>It is likely that the transmission of coronavirus is similar to that of other respiratory viruses such as influenza. That means that the infection occurs from contact with respiratory secretions of someone who is infected. That can be from directly touching the infected person or from being coughed on. Then, the droplets from the person coughing land on you and establish infection. That means that the most important thing you can do is proper hand hygiene, either washing with soap and water or using an alcohol-based hand sanitizer when you have contact with someone who might have a respiratory illness. It is very unlikely that walking around with a mask (as many are doing elsewhere) will make any difference.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Will a normal flu shot help me avoid the worst symptoms?</strong></p>\n\n<p>The flu shot is for preventing infection from influenza and will not prevent coronavirus infection. However, the illness caused by influenza is similar to the coronavirus infection, so if influenza is prevented, there is less chance of suspecting that you have the coronavirus when in fact, it is influenza.</p>\n\n<p><strong>If I catch the virus what is the standard treatment?</strong></p>\n\n<p>So far, there is not a specific medication that treats the virus (as is true for most viruses). However, with good supportive care nearly everyone can survive. That includes oxygen when needed and even a ventilator for those who are really sick.</p>\n\n<p><strong>I have a bad cough and would normally not see a doctor for it\u2014but with this going on, should I go?</strong></p>\n\n<p>As of the 9th of March, we have not had any cases of the coronavirus infection in Kenya. That means that for people without recent international travel, any cough is from another cause, usually a virus. If you are not sick enough to require medical attention, there are two advantages to not going in. First, by staying at home, you will spread the virus to fewer people. Second, it is common that doctors give antibiotics even when they won\u2019t help, such as for a viral respiratory infection, so you can save yourself from an unnecessary antibiotic.</p>\n\n<p>Given that the virus originated from animals should I stay away from meat and animal products? Should I worry how I handle animals?<br>\nThe 2019-nCoV coronavirus is originally a bat virus but likely was initially transmitted to humans via another mammal. However, now all the transmission is human to human, so animal contact will not make any difference for this virus. However, do note that there are other infections that can be acquired from animals. For example, there is anthrax from dead cattle who are then butchered. There is brucellosis from goats, sheep and other animals, and Salmonella from chickens and eggs. And don\u2019t forget dogs; if they haven\u2019t been immunized, they can transmit rabies when they bite. That means we must be careful with animals, but it won\u2019t affect our getting the coronavirus.</p>\n\n<p><strong>What is Aga Khan University hospital doing for preparation?</strong></p>\n\n<p>If patients come with a potentially contagious illness they will be screened on entry to the facility and when necessary, appropriate precautions will be used. This includes things ranging from TB to cholera to influenza. That same screening process will identify people who might have the coronavirus. In that case, they will be given a surgical mask and will be taken to an individual room to keep them from placing others at risk. If they require hospitalization, whether a regular room or intensive care, they will be placed in an individual room with proper ventilation.</p>\n\n<p>Patients with COVID-19 will receive the level of care that is required for their illness, including intensive care treatment and advanced medical treatment when needed, such as a breathing mechanical ventilation or kidney dialysis.</p>\n\n<p>First, those do not truly require medical attention should stay home. Those who do need medical attention should come to A&amp;E where they will be triaged to room 18 for evaluation. The team there will evaluate the patient quickly and decide between discharge, admission to ward level (third floor), HDU or ICU. We anticipate that with the physical exam and pulse ox, the disposition can be done for most patients. Some may require blood gases or chest x-ray; these are also available in A&amp;E.</p>\n\n</article>", "canonicalUrl": "https://nairobinews.nation.co.ke/frequently-asked-questions-about-coronavirus/"},{"url": "https://nairobinews.nation.co.ke/the-raging-debate-on-e-cigarettes-is-africa-missing-out/", "probability": 0.99160963, "headline": "The raging debate on e-cigarettes; is Africa missing out?", "datePublished": "2020-03-13T00:00:00", "datePublishedRaw": "March 13th, 2020", "author": "Gragory Nyauchi", "authorsList": ["Gragory Nyauchi"], "inLanguage": "en", "mainImage": "https://nairobinews.nation.co.ke/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/e-cigarette.jpg", "images": ["https://nairobinews.nation.co.ke/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/e-cigarette-150x150.jpg"], "description": "News,Gossip,Sports and Entertainment from Nairobi.", "articleBody": "Debate is raging globally around smoke-free alternatives, such as e-cigarettes, which are being presented by tobacco companies as safer options for smokers.\n\nOn one hand, cigarette manufacturers offer these alternatives as less risky, scientifically cleared substitutes with potential to cut well-documented health effects of consuming tobacco and nicotine.\n\nOn the other hand, anti-tobacco activists favour a campaign that advocates for total cessation.
