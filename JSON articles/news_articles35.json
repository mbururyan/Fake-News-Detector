Oloo Janak. PHOTO/KCA By PATRICK MAYOYO Proposed amendments to the Media Council Act 2013 has sparked a heated debate among media and legal stakehol\u2026", "articleBody": "By PATRICK MAYOYO\n\nProposed amendments to the Media Council Act 2013 has sparked a heated debate among media and legal stakeholders with the two groups holding different views on the same.\n\nAmong the media stakeholders, the Kenya Correspondents Association (KCA) was the first to unleash a salvo against the proposed law saying the changes lacked public participation from stakeholders as is required by the law.\n\nThe KCA chairman Oloo Janak said his association had only learnt about the proposed changes when they were already before the National Assembly Committee on Communication, Information and Innovation.\n\n\u201cTo the best of our recollection at KCA, no proposals have been tabled before the media stakeholders to debate or add on before they are/were taken to the National Assembly,\u201d Mr Janak said in a statement.\n\nHowever, lawyer William Oketch, the Chairman of the Media Council of Kenya (MCK) Complaints Commission played down concerns raised by KCA saying no stakeholders have been locked out from the process.\n\n\u201cPublic participation takes place after the 1st reading when the Bill is committed to the Departmental committee to facilitate public participation,\u201d he said.\n\nMr Oketch said having analysed the proposed changes; he can confidently assert that it is neither a threat nor affront to media freedoms.\n\n\u201cIt just seeks to improve the regulatory framework by making it efficient and streamlined,\u201d he asserted.\n\nMr Janak however said KCA was alarmed by the reported initiative to amend the Media Act quietly and called for clarification on who has initiated the process to amend the Act, what specific proposals have been made and why the industry has not been robustly involved.\n\n\u201cWe urge stakeholders, at individual institutional levels not to fall into any temptation or conspiracy in a process so profound as the change of media laws. This direction must be avoided as it has the potential to drag the industry into controversy, bring disunity and disharmony, and which may lead to protracted legal action again, and in an election year,\u201d he warned.\n\nMr Janak said the position of KCA was that, like in 2011-2013, the media industry and allied support groups must take a common position on this process and ensure open consultations and insist on public participation.\n\n\u201cAgain, we must be alive to the dangers of initiating amendments to media laws in an election year because the state normally takes advantage of that to bring in provisions that are meant to undermine press freedom,\u201d he warned.\n\nThe KCA chairman said reports of entrenched and self-serving interests and the possibility of advancing state zeal to control the media sector, through the amendment process ( the interests appear to be both in the media industry and within parliament) \u2018are very unsettling and should worry us\u2019.\n\n\u201cWe at KCA look forward to any urgent response and clarification from any stakeholder group that may be a promoter or privy to this process, to inform our way forward. We will certainly not accept or participate in a flawed process,\u201d Mr Janak noted.\n\nHowever, Mr Oketch said from both a lawyer and adjudicator\u2019s perspective, his preliminary pick-outs showed that the proposed changes does not take away from MCK nor add onto the Executive any functional roles and powers of the MCK under section 6.\n\nHe said the proposed amendments follows the British parliamentary model of Bill origination, Speakers approval for publication, 1st and 2nd reading, Committee stage, Report stage, 3rd reading and Assent.\n\n\u201cIn this context the Bill has just been approved for publication then tabling after origination was done by the Chair of the Departmental committee due to emergent stakeholder concerns from previous engagements as far as 2018,\u201d he added.\n\nMr Oketch said no stakeholders have been locked out from the process as public participation takes place after the 1st reading when the Bill is committed to the Departmental committee to facilitate public participation.\n\nHe said the National Assembly Committee on Communication, Information and Innovation will after Parliament resumes conduct public participation (by inviting views) comments from members of the public as well as inviting the core stakeholder groups to make presentations before it.\n\n\u201cThe law binds them to take into consideration these views when making the report to the house,\u201d he noted.\n\nMr Oketch said the proposed changes aims to heal some defects in the present as there are certain interpretative words which were already in the law but by omission the previous process failed to contextualize them for clarity and ease of regulatory efficiency in this way, media practitioners, consumer of media services and users of media services.\n\n\u201cThis accords with regional and international best practices where due to convergence of platforms media practitioners or users need to be defined,\u201d he emphasised.\n\nMr Oketch said having sat in the previous Media Complaints Commission plus as current chairperson this definition is a huge relief for adjudicatory reach.\n\n\u201cThere are people in our newsrooms who are not journalist\u2019s yet hold the microphone, practice this trade and continuously have breached the Code. When complaints come they are struck out on a technicality of the strict definition of a journalist to whom the Act applies. A great injustice to the aggrieved parties,\u201d he noted.\n\nMr Oketch said the proposals streamlines the cadres of which journalists are within the accreditation ambit such as practitioners, local and foreign journalists, adding this is not a degrading of the original journalist\u2019s standing but a matter of functional regulation akin to the Health Bill categorizing doctors, nurses, clinicians and lab technicians all as health/medical practitioners which in no way degrades a doctor\u2019s eminent domain.\n\n\u201cThe amendments attempt to widen the basket for Financing through a Levy and media fund. This seems a positive steps towards increasing alternative funding as government funds decrease in due course thus a move towards increased independence and autonomy,\u201d he noted.\n\nHe added that the Bill entrenches the scope of regulatory for example; penalties for masquerading, in this way, those who are not accredited but practice illegally will be prosecuted hence weeding out quacks.\n\nMr Oketch observed that the Bill takes away from the ICT Cabinet Secretary powers of making regulations and places it in the Council with the scope or type of regulations expanded to include on financing, accreditation and regulation.\n\nHe said on the Complaints Commission the Bill deletes the section that qualified a sitting judicial officer from serving as chairperson as precautionary measure of independence plus relieving the Commission from the duty of serving process which ordinarily should be the complainants forte.\n\n\u201cThe Bill then inserts the various interpretative/defined words the substantive sections across the entire Act to ensure ease of applicability,\u201d he said.\n\nOn training and approval of curriculum for journalism schools, Mr Oketch said the Bill attempts to entrench the role of the Media Council of Kenya in determining training curriculum.\n\n\u201cA good move for streamlining standards. But if not amended it\u2019s headed for turbulent waters. There are several High Court decisions affirming that the Commission for University Education is the only body that approves training curriculum,\u201d he warned.\n\nHe added that this case was a contest between the Council for Legal Education (CLE) and CUE.

It attracts media attention, sponsors and draws significant global viewership. Organised every two years, it is also considered one of the most difficult to win based on a large qualification pool.\n\nSince it was first held in 1957, only 14 countries have won the right to be called African champions. What factors could possibly explain this?\n\nThere is a shortage of research in this area. So, we set out to understand what factors could explain the successful performance of these national teams in Africa\u2019s premier football tournament.\n\nUnlike normal clubs, national teams don\u2019t have full-time players. Instead they have to draw them from club teams, both domestically and abroad. Given the short time they have available to select and prepare a national team for a major tournament, a huge plus would be knowing what a winning combination looks like. Understanding these factors could also have broader management applications, such as a reliance on teamwork, cohesion, diversity as well as recruiting the right people.\n\nDrawing panel data from AFCON tournaments held between 1990 and 2017, we studied the performance of 38 African countries. We found that team mix, young talent, team experience and the national team\u2019s ranking by FIFA had a significant marginal effect on the performance of teams in the continent\u2019s premier tournament.\n\nOur data analysis showed how active, elite foreign based and local players, a blend of young talents, team experience and familiarity with the terrain and nature of the tournament, and consistent high international ranking by international football governing body FIFA improved a team\u2019s chances of winning tournaments.\n\nBased on our findings we have come up with a proposed framework for composing a national team around four areas: team mix, young talent, team experience and international rankings. This framework applies even at the World Cup level to teams from other regions.\n\nSo, what is it about these dimensions of team composition that explains a national team\u2019s chances of winning the African Cup of Nations?\n\nFirst, a look at selecting players who have played for top leagues abroad.\n\nTeam mix: players from foreign and local leagues\n\nThese players offer experience that translates into high performance. Foreign clubs have better training facilities which enable migrant players to develop their talents and improve their performance.\n\nBut players from national teams bring their own set of strengths. Those who have played in a domestic league are familiar with the African terrain and adapt better to terrain changes.\n\nThere\u2019s more to the team mix than this: a national team increases its winning chances if it can establish a unique identity that transcends the assembly of star players.\n\nAnd then there\u2019s the age factor. The consideration of what we label young talent is also imperative to overall success. This refers to a team\u2019s average age. A team with an average age of 22 can be described as youthful. These players offer physical strength but they are inexperienced. A mature team is one with an average age of 26. These players have strength and stamina to ensure high performance. The third category in the mix is the experienced group, built around players aged 27 years and older. This category has experience but may lack strength on the pitch.\n\nIdeally, a team should have a blend of all three.\n\nTeam experience is also crucial. This refers to the number of appearances made in the tournament, which can help guarantee familiarity with tournaments. A good level of team experience is participating on average at least nine times. Beyond this, a team stands an improved chance of thriving in continental tournaments.\n\nThe fact that team experience matters is supported by other studies that have found a similar outcome of experience which tends to affect performance.\n\nFIFA rankings also matter. Highly ranked teams have better medal winning potential in tournaments than lower ranked teams. FIFA ranking is a strong determinant to grouping national teams for tournaments. This ensures that these teams are seeded in international competitions due to their sporting success.\n\nThe danger is that high rankings lead to complacency which in turn can ruin a team\u2019s potential.\n\nWe also identified an added ingredient: a team\u2019s ability to integrate individual talent within the limited time available for preparation increased the likelihood of a better performance in the tournament.\n\nA good balanced team\n\nOur framework for a national team\u2019s composition provides useful information on elements to consider when putting together a national team. This formula can be used by team managers, performance analysts and match pundits. Our framework does not shoot down the role of motivation in team performance but points to a neglected area \u2013 team composition.\n\nA team composed of more professional players from elite leagues abroad provides a good balanced team capable of achieving desirable results.

PHOTO/ROBERT WANYONYI By PATRICK MAYOYO Before they embraced \u2026", "articleBody": "By PATRICK MAYOYO\n\nBefore they embraced mushroom farming, some members of Uplands Mushroom Growers in Lari, Kiambu County, regarded it as wild crop with no economic, nutritional or health benefits.\n\nMajority of them had grown up seeing mushrooms sprout up in the local fields and woodlands but they were cautioned against touching them leave alone eating as they were regarded as a poisonous plants by their parents.\n\n\u201cWhile growing up here in Lari we were rebuked by our parents whenever we played with mushrooms we had picked in the fields warning us that makuno \u2013 Kikuyu name for mushrooms, was poison,\u201d Anne Wanjiru a resident of Lari says.\n\nBut today, their story has changed. Thanks to the introduction of the Green Zones Development Support Project II (GZDSPII) that is funded by the African Development Bank at a tune of Ksh 5 billion, that is now helping them change their lives through mushrooms farming.\n\nTheir organization Uplands Mushroom Growers is now spearheading a revolutionary social economic campaign of not only training villagers on how to grow mushrooms but also creating awareness on how to help fight deforestation, climate change and its impacts and sustainably benefit from the initiative.\n\nBetween 1980 and 2000, Kenya lost nearly 50 percent of its forest cover. Some 300,000 hectares of forest were destroyed due to intensive logging, charcoal production and large-scale clearance of wooded areas for tea plantations.\n\nSymbolic of this destruction is the Mau Forest, at 273,000 hectares the largest forested area in Kenya with a seven-lake drainage basin covering more than 69,000 km 2, from which one quarter of its canopy had disappeared.\n\nThe project is also expected to significantly increase (by 25%) the annual incomes of 375,912 households (40% female-headed) through direct employment, and income generating activities.\n\nAnd as farmers in Lari, Kiambu in Central Kenya continue to experience dismal crop yields due to changing weather patterns triggered by the impacts of climate change mainly due to deforestation, Uplands Mushroom Growers are now conserving local forests through afforestation as they also engage in mushroom farming.\n\nAccording to, Mr David Kuria, the Deputy Project Manager of GZDSP II, the project provides new and more efficient ways of increasing forest cover, increasing food security and improving community livelihoods through sustainable and inclusive commodity value chain and market development.\n\nMr Kuria adds that the project is being implemented in 15 counties in Kenya namely; Embu, Meru, Machakos, Tharaka-Nithi, Nyeri, Murang\u2019a, Kirinyaga, Kiambu, Nyandarua, Nakuru, Baringo, Kericho, Bomet, Nyamira and Kisii.\n\n\u201cThese counties cover four forest conservancies and three out of five of Kenya\u2019s water towers including Mt. Kenya, Aberdares, and the Mau complex. The counties were selected based on levels of forest degradation, social economic and environmental vulnerability,\u201d Mr Kuria said.\n\nHe added that the project, which will be implemented over a period of six years (2018-2024), comprises three main components, Forest Conservation and Livelihood Support, Sustainable and Inclusive Value Chains Development and Project Management and Coordination.\n\nTony Njuguna, a comedian and retired advertising executive is among residents of Lari who has embraced mushroom farming.\n\n\u201cWhen I was informed about this project I decided to give it a try and I can now say that I made the right decision. I just harvested my first crop and I am not complaining,\u201d he said when we visited his project.\n\nNjuguna said he had not only decided to expand the mushroom business but he had invested in the required expertise through training and engaging consultants to ensure his production processes are purely organic.\n\n\u201cWe are using vermiculture technique to avoid use of pesticides in the production of our mushrooms which makes them purely organic,\u201d he says.\n\nVermiculture is a technique based on utilizing some species of earthworms to convert organic waste into vermicompost which is again, the product of decomposition by various worms. It is a practice of harvesting worms that take part in decomposing organic waste and turning it into nutrient-rich fertilizer.\n\nFor farmers who have already embraced mushroom farming like Tony, the future looks bright. Currently, Kenya produces 40 tonnes of mushrooms and imports another 17 tonnes from Rwanda to meet its demand.\n\nStudies show the global mushroom market was valued at 12.74 million tons (MT) in 2018 and is projected to reach 20.84 million tons (MT) by 2026, exhibiting a compound annual growth rate (CAGR) of 6.41 percent in the forecast period.\n\nThe Global \u201cFunctional Mushroom Market\u201d 2021 report shows that the global mushroom market size is expected to reach US$ 95.24 billion by 2028, expanding at a CAGR of 9.5 percent.\n\nIMAGE/FAO\n\nMr Patrick Kanyi Muchiri, a senior technician at the Institute of Biotechnology at the Jomo Kenyatta University of Science and Technology (JKUAT) says mushroom farming helps in recycling of agricultural waste.\n\n\u201cSpawn the raw material used in growing mushrooms that mainly comes from agricultural waste like maize husks, rice and wheat straws and saw dust makes mushroom farming friendly to the environment as the resultant compost can be used as fertilizer to grow other crops in the nearby farms,\u201d Muchiri adds.\n\nThere\u2019s a growing body of evidence of how mushrooms can help the environment. In a 2008 TED talk, mycologist Paul Stamets discussed six ways the mycelium fungus can help save the planet, including cleaning polluted soil, making insecticides, treating smallpox and even flu viruses.\n\nResearchers also found that a naturally occurring bacterium that occurs from harvesting mushrooms can actually be turned into a biofuel, which can reduce emissions from biofuels, according to a study in the journal Science Advances.\n\nIMAGE/FAO\n\nMushrooms are even a solution for packaging. The New York-based biotech company Ecovative Design, for instance, has made packaging material which has been used by companies such as Ikea and Dell, according to NBC News.\n\nMr Basil Murila, the Gender and Community Development Officer for the Green Zones Development Support Project II GZDSP II says apart from mushroom farming, the project supports 45 groups to implement income generating projects.\n\n\u201cThe project is focused on fish-farming, sheep breeding, briquettes, banana value addition, events hosting, dairy and goat farming, water-harvesting, eco-tourism, virgin forest soil harvesting and herbal medicines,\u201d he said.\n\nMr Murila said the groups are composed of between 15 to 30 people and they are spread out in all the 15 counties where the GZDSP II is being implemented.\n\nHe adds that projects like the Uplands Mushroom Growers being implemented through the Plantations Establishment and Livelihood Improvement Scheme Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs).\n\nMushrooms are filamentous fungi that produce large, often edible fruiting bodies. They live on organic material, thriving on compost, fallen leaves and damp wood and any other dead plant or animal matter. Their role in causing decay is important in maintaining ecological cycles.\n\nThe Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations (FAO) says studies estimate that the total number of useful fungi \u2013 defined as having edible and medicinal value \u2013 are over 2 300 species adding that cultivated mushrooms have now become popular all over the world.\n\nFAO in a booklet called Make Money By Growing Mushrooms adds that mushroom cultivation can directly improve livelihoods through economic, nutritional and medicinal contributions.\n\n\u201cMedicinal fungi have routinely been used in traditional Chinese medicine. Today, an estimated six percent of edible mushrooms are known to have medicinal properties and can be found in health tonics, tinctures, teas, soups and herbal formulas,\u201d FAO notes.\n\nStudies show fungi also play an important role in the carbon cycle, the biogeochemical process by which carbon\u2014the essential element of life on Earth\u2014moves between the air, soils and water.

Fresh mushrooms have a high water content, around 90 percent, so drying them is an effective way to both prolong their shelf-life and preserve their flavour and nutrients,\u201d the report notes.\n\nIt adds that mushroom cultivation activities can play an important role in supporting the local economy by contributing to subsistence food security, nutrition, and medicine; generating additional employment and income through local, regional and national trade; and offering opportunities for processing enterprises.\n\nAnother study, , by Prof. Nezir Tanovi\u0107, says all indicators are in favour of the fact that there is a gradual increase in the mushroom production volumes.\n\n\u201cThe volume refers not only to the production of button mushrooms, but also to production of oyster and shiitake mushrooms,\u201d the UNDP study says.\n\nIMAGE/UGC\n\nFor anyone still doubting the potential of farming in creating wealth, the President of the African Development Bank (ADB), Dr. Akinwumi Adesina says by 2030, the size of the food and agri-business in Africa will reach $1 Trillion and if one was thinking of how to make money, this is the sector to be in.\n\n\u201cThe next generation of billionaires in Africa will be farmers,\u201d Dr Adesina says.", "articleBodyHtml": "<article>\n\n<p><strong>By PATRICK MAYOYO</strong></p>\n\n<p>Before they embraced mushroom farming, some members of Uplands Mushroom Growers in Lari, Kiambu County, regarded it as wild crop with no economic, nutritional or health benefits.</p>\n\n<p>Majority of them had grown up seeing mushrooms sprout up in the local fields and woodlands but they were cautioned against touching them leave alone eating as they were regarded as a poisonous plants by their parents.</p>\n\n<blockquote><h2><strong>\u201cWhile growing up here in Lari we were rebuked by our parents whenever we played with mushrooms we had picked in the fields warning us that makuno \u2013 Kikuyu name for mushrooms, was poison,\u201d Anne Wanjiru a resident of Lari says.</strong></h2></blockquote>\n\n<p>But today, their story has changed. Thanks to the introduction of the\u00a0<a href=\"https://projectsportal.afdb.org/dataportal/VProject/show/P-KE-AAD-005\">Green Zones Development Support Project II</a>\u00a0(GZDSPII) that is funded by the African Development Bank at a tune of Ksh 5 billion, that is now helping them change their lives through mushrooms farming.</p>\n\n<p>Their organization\u00a0Uplands Mushroom Growers is now spearheading a revolutionary social economic campaign of not only training villagers on how to grow mushrooms but also creating awareness on how to help fight deforestation, climate change and its impacts and sustainably benefit from the initiative.</p>\n\n<p>Between 1980 and 2000,\u00a0<a href=\"https://www.afdb.org/en/countries/east-africa/kenya/\">Kenya</a>\u00a0lost nearly 50 percent of its forest cover. Some 300,000 hectares of forest were destroyed due to intensive logging, charcoal production and large-scale clearance of wooded areas for tea plantations.</p>\n\n<p>Symbolic of this destruction is the Mau Forest, at 273,000 hectares the largest forested area in Kenya with a seven-lake drainage basin covering more than 69,000 km<sup>2</sup>, from which one quarter of its canopy had disappeared.</p>\n\n<p>The project is also expected to significantly increase (by 25%) the annual incomes of 375,912 households (40% female-headed) through direct employment, and income generating activities.</p>\n\n<p>And as farmers in Lari, Kiambu in Central Kenya continue to experience dismal crop yields due to changing weather patterns triggered by the impacts of climate change mainly due to deforestation, Uplands Mushroom Growers are now conserving local forests through afforestation as they also engage in mushroom farming.</p>\n\n<p>According to, Mr David Kuria, the Deputy Project Manager of GZDSP II, the project provides new and more efficient ways of increasing forest cover, increasing food security and improving community livelihoods through sustainable and inclusive commodity value chain and market development.</p>\n\n<p>Mr Kuria adds that the project is being implemented in 15 counties in Kenya namely; Embu, Meru, Machakos, Tharaka-Nithi, Nyeri, Murang\u2019a, Kirinyaga, Kiambu, Nyandarua, Nakuru, Baringo, Kericho, Bomet, Nyamira and Kisii.</p>\n\n<p>\u201cThese counties cover four forest conservancies and three out of five of\u00a0 Kenya\u2019s water towers including Mt. Kenya, Aberdares, and the Mau complex. The counties were selected based on levels of forest degradation, social economic and environmental vulnerability,\u201d Mr Kuria said.</p>\n\n<p>He added that the project, which will be implemented over a period of six years (2018-2024), comprises three main components, Forest Conservation and Livelihood Support, Sustainable and Inclusive Value Chains Development and Project Management and Coordination.</p>\n\n<p>Tony Njuguna, a comedian and retired advertising executive is among residents of Lari who has embraced mushroom farming.</p>\n\n<blockquote><h2><strong>\u201cWhen I was informed about this project I decided to give it a try and I can now say that I made the right decision. I just harvested my first crop and I am not complaining,\u201d he said when we visited his project.</strong></h2></blockquote>\n\n<p>Njuguna said he had not only decided to expand the mushroom business but he had invested in the required expertise through training and engaging consultants to ensure his production processes are purely organic.</p>\n\n<p>\u201cWe are using\u00a0<a href=\"https://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/vermiculture\">vermiculture</a>\u00a0technique to avoid use of pesticides in the production of our mushrooms which makes them purely organic,\u201d he says.</p>\n\n<p>Vermiculture is a\u00a0technique based on utilizing some species of earthworms to convert organic waste into\u00a0vermicompost which is again, the product of decomposition by various worms. It is a practice of harvesting worms that take part in decomposing organic waste and turning it into nutrient-rich fertilizer.</p>\n\n<p>For farmers who have already embraced mushroom farming like Tony, the future looks bright.\u00a0Currently, Kenya produces 40 tonnes of mushrooms and imports another 17 tonnes from Rwanda to meet its demand.</p>\n\n<p>Studies show the global mushroom market was valued at 12.74 million tons (MT) in 2018 and is projected to reach\u00a020.84 million tons (MT) by 2026, exhibiting a compound annual growth rate (CAGR) of 6.41 percent in the forecast period.</p>\n\n<p>The Global\u00a0<a href=\"https://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20211129005462/en/Global-Mushroom-Market-Report-2021---ResearchAndMarkets.com\">\u201cFunctional Mushroom Market\u201d\u00a0</a>2021 report shows that the global mushroom market size is expected to reach US$ 95.24 billion by 2028, expanding at a CAGR of 9.5 percent.</p>\n\n<p><em><strong>IMAGE/FAO</strong></em></p>\n\n<p>Mr Patrick Kanyi Muchiri, a senior technician at the Institute of Biotechnology at the Jomo Kenyatta University of Science and Technology (JKUAT) says mushroom farming helps in recycling of agricultural waste.</p>\n\n<p>\u201cSpawn the raw material used in growing mushrooms that mainly comes from agricultural waste like maize husks, rice and wheat straws and saw dust makes mushroom farming friendly to the environment as the resultant compost can be used as fertilizer to grow other crops in the nearby farms,\u201d Muchiri adds.</p>\n\n<p>There\u2019s a growing body of evidence of how mushrooms can help the environment. In a\u00a0<a href=\"https://www.ted.com/talks/paul_stamets_6_ways_mushrooms_can_save_the_world\">2008 TED talk</a>, mycologist Paul Stamets discussed six ways the mycelium fungus can help save the planet, including cleaning polluted soil, making insecticides, treating smallpox and even flu viruses.</p>\n\n<p>Researchers also found that a naturally occurring bacterium that occurs from harvesting mushrooms can actually be turned into a biofuel, which can reduce emissions from biofuels, according to a study in the journal\u00a0<a href=\"https://advances.sciencemag.org/content/4/3/e1701475\"><em>Science Advances</em></a>.</p>\n\n<p><em><strong>IMAGE/FAO</strong></em></p>\n\n<p>Mushrooms are even a solution for packaging.

In a written response, a spokesperson said all rent paid to BADICA goes into a frozen account, which is monitored by CAR authorities. A UN payment of rent arrears to the BADICA Ecobank account was authorised in June, suggesting payments were held back for several months.\n\nBADICA disputes the sanctions listing and has launched a legal challenge to its enforcement in the European Union, which is obliged to implement UN sanctions rulings. A person answering the telephone at KARDIAM\u2019s office in Belgium declined to comment and efforts to contact BADICA in CAR were unsuccessful.\n\nThe UN says it has attempted to find alternative premises since BADICA\u2019s listing, but without success.\n\n\u201cNo other site in Bangui meets the mission\u2019s needs,\u201d the UN spokesperson told IRIN. \u201cThe BADICA premises are unique in their size and their ability to accommodate the BJTF (Bangui Joint Task Force).\u201d\n\nThe UN mission, known as MINUSCA, currently consists of nearly 13,000 uniformed personnel. It was set up in 2014 following the overthrow of President Fran\u00e7ois Boziz\u00e9 by S\u00e9l\u00e9ka rebels in 2013 with a mandate to protect civilians, promote human rights and support the political transition process.\n\nThe sanctions, authorised by the UN Security Council, ban international trade and transactions and have global force. All of the company\u2019s financial assets and economic resources are frozen and no further money can be transferred to the company by any individuals or entities. UN procurement rules specifically exclude companies on the sanctions list.\n\nPre-existing contracts with sanctioned firms can, however, continue under certain circumstances, according to Security Council resolutions. The spokesperson said the BADICA contract, as it began before the listing, was allowable under the terms of the sanctions resolution. The UN\u2019s peacekeeping department says it has notified the Security Council sanctions committee and a panel of experts that advises on sanctions-related issues for the Central African Republic.\n\nThe UN has twice amended its contract with BADICA, originally signed on 1 November 2013. The current extension continues until the end of October 2016, and the monthly payments have increased from five to six million FCFA ($10,200) per month, according to the UN statement to IRIN.\n\n\u201cThe mission is continuing to make all efforts to explore and identify alternative premises,\u201d the statement continued.\n\nBADICA is part of the Antwerp-based group Groupe Abdoulkarim, headed by businessman Abdoulkarim Dan Azoumi, who lives in Belgium. The group also includes Minair, an aviation company, and Sofia-TP, a transport firm, listed as \u201cbranches\u201d of BADICA in the UN sanctions list.\n\nAmnesty International\n\nBADICA\u2019s offices in Carnot, a key mining region\n\nIRIN\u2019s examination of UN procurement data also revealed a UN contract with Sofia-TP for \u201ctransport and cargo services\u201d in 2014.\n\nThrough both the leasing contract with BADICA and the contract with Sofia-TP, the UN had paid a total of $495,571 to Groupe Abdoulkarim by the end of 2015, whilst condemning one of its companies for its role in funding S\u00e9l\u00e9ka rebels through the diamond trade. Rent due in 2016 would increase the total to over $550,000.\n\nThe UN listing states: \u201cBADICA/KARDIAM has provided support for armed groups in the Central African Republic, namely former S\u00e9l\u00e9ka and anti-balaka, through the illicit exploitation and trade of natural resources, including diamonds and gold.\u201d\n\n\u201cThese recent findings that reveal financial deals made between the UN peacekeeping mission in CAR and BADICA authorised by the UN security council reflects the failure of the international community to address the financing of the armed conflicts in CAR,\u201d says Nathalia Dukhan from the Enough Project, a campaign which aims to end genocide and mass atrocities in Africa.\n\nA new report for the UN Security Council on the conflict in CAR draws a picture of continued arms smuggling, militia activity, illicit exploitation of natural resources and an upsurge in conflict as well as abuses and displacement of civilians.\n\nThe UN\u2019s mission to stabilise CAR has been weighed down by revelations of sexual abuse by peacekeepers. A senior UN human rights official recently resigned over the UN\u2019s mishandling of reports of sexual abuse by foreign troops.\n\nIt follows a series of French and UN-led operations including Operation Sangaris and BINUCA. MINUSCA\u2019s annual budget stands at $816 million.\n\nA shaky peace\n\nFollowing the overthrow of Boziz\u00e9 in 2013, a number of diamond mines in CAR fell under the control of the country\u2019s S\u00e9l\u00e9ka militia, an alliance of mainly Muslim armed factions.\n\nThe illegal \u201ctaxes\u201d imposed on the mines by the militia led to the country being excluded from the Kimberley Process, a global initiative aimed at stopping the international trade of \u2018blood diamonds\u2019, meaning that companies like BADICA could not legally export any diamonds.\n\nRough diamonds exported from a state participating in the Kimberley Process must come with a certificate confirming that they are not \u2018conflict diamonds\u2019.\n\nDespite being rich in natural resources, CAR remains one of the poorest countries in the world. Before a 2013 ban on the flow of conflict diamonds, they were a key export. At their peak in 2006, the value of diamond exports reached $70 million.\n\nBADICA was sanctioned after officials in Antwerp, Belgium seized a parcel sent to its sister company KARDIAM.
