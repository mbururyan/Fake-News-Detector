Hopefully now he can maintain this rhythm for longer because we need him, absolutely we need him.\n\n\u201cIn the minutes he played against Wolves [on Saturday] there was a little bit of a lack of rhythm and messy play but that is normal, it is not easy to come back from the bench. He trained really well the last two days and this type of game where it is a little bit more open - they put a lot of players in front and a lot of players wide - and in transition, Kevin is the best.\n\n\u201cSometimes he struggles a little bit when the other team settles so, so deep and so tight like, for example, Wolves but we are pleased because we need him. We are together six seasons, I know him very well and he knows me very well and what he has done for me is everything and he has been so important. He\u2019s phenomenal.\u201d\n\nIf Manchester City scoring seven goals as they racked up their seventh consecutive Premier League win was not ominous enough for their title rivals, there was the sight of Kevin de Bruyne back in scoring form too.\n\nUp until his brilliant two-goal performance in City\u2019s 7-0 demolition of Leeds, the 30-year-old Belgian\u2019s season had been blighted by illness and injury.\n\nWhen he had played, he was below his imperious best, but Tuesday\u2019s sparkling display was a reminder of how good he is in full flow \u2014 and how important he is to his side\u2019s title defence.\n\nCity had gone top of the table at the start of December largely without his help - but he was inspirational as they demolished Marcelo Bielsa\u2019s side to move four points clear. De Bruyne\u2019s reduced impact this season can be measured in the assists he has contributed \u2014 zero \u2014 a stark contrast between the 12 he managed in 2020-21 and the record-equalling 20 from the 2019-20 campaign.\n\nHe did not break his duck against Leeds but his strikes either side of half-time doubled his goals tally for the season and his all-round display was superb \u2014 he had nine shots, made four key passes and his distribution in midfield was as good as ever.\n\nDe Bruyne will hope it draws a line under a difficult season so far. He returned from the European Championship with an ankle injury and after starting on the bench at Tottenham on the opening day in August he did not feature for another month, then tested positive for Covid-19 in November.\n\nManchester City midfielder Kevin De Bruyne celebrates after scoring against Leeds United at the Etihad Stadium on December 14\nImage: /AFP", "articleBodyHtml": "<article>\n\n<p>\u201cA lot has happened this year, a little bit out of out of my control,\u201d he told BT Sport.</p>\n\n<p>\u201cThe only thing I could do is work hard and come back as quick as possible.

He trained really well the last two days and this type of game where it is a little bit more open - they put a lot of players in front and a lot of players wide - and in transition, Kevin is the best.</p>\n\n<p>\u201cSometimes he struggles a little bit when the other team settles so, so deep and so tight like, for example, Wolves but we are pleased because we need him. We are together six seasons, I know him very well and he knows me very well and what he has done for me is everything and he has been so important.

De Bruyne\u2019s reduced impact this season can be measured in the assists he has contributed \u2014 zero \u2014 a stark contrast between the 12 he managed in 2020-21 and the record-equalling 20 from the 2019-20 campaign.</p>\n\n<p>He did not break his duck against Leeds but his strikes either side of half-time doubled his goals tally for the season and his all-round display was superb \u2014 he had nine shots, made four key passes and his distribution in midfield was as good as ever.</p>\n\n<p>De Bruyne will hope it draws a line under a difficult season so far. He returned from the European Championship with an ankle injury and after starting on the bench at Tottenham on the opening day in August he did not feature for another month, then tested positive for Covid-19 in November.</p>\n\n<figure><a data-image=\"//lh3.googleusercontent.com/dJfGCKcVxEMAF1bVzQC16KZd_yGA-0t07SQ5K1DsG3knIl53xBIBFc4q3iLCWgacMIR9fbgVkgNmWsWPv9v73quz_10x6qMG1QspITOtXg\"
