The idea is to scare institutions that have the powers, influence and control over the operations within the Judiciary to shy off and thus allow the rampant graft in the judiciary to proceed unabated. What Kinoti failed to understand was, when he arrested Deputy Chief Justice Philomena Mwilu, he had stepped on wrong toes of the cartel that also has lawyers commonly referred to as the Karen gang. They were grooming Mwilu to succeed then Chief Justice David Maraga. The arrest and prosecution blocked the gang ill motives. They were forced to start marketing lawyer Fred Ngatia as Maraga successor.\n\nThe emergency of Martha Koome on the scene caught them unawares. For them, Chief Justice Koome is a state project being used to have Judicial Service Commission (JSC) fix Mwilu and force her retire from the office to avoid embarrassment. By fronting Ngatia, the cartel were out to portray him as state house favoured face by virtue of having been president Uhuru Kenyatta lawyer at Supreme Court presidential petition. In fact, word has it, Ngatia link with the cartel costed him dearly. It is not only Koome and Kinoti the cartel has marked. It was to be business as usual with Mwilu or Ngatia at helm. Sources say, the most lucrative court is that of Appeal hence the current happenings on the blocked appointments by Uhuru Kenyatta. The first target is president Uhuru Kenyatta who has no kind words for Kenyan judiciary. Uhuru has seen most of his directives being overturned by judges putting the offices of his legal advisers into question as to whether they are up to the game or just victims of the supremacy war between the executive and judiciary. The war between Uhuru and judges got ugly during the Building Bridges Initiative Court of Appeal ruling that gave window for the arrest of Uhuru in near future for having acted unconstitutionally. In the judgment, the Court of Appeal was heavily critical to Uhuru stating that the BBI Bill was unconstitutional and usurped the people\u2019s sovereign power. The seven-judge bench also issued a permanent injunction against Independent and Electoral Boundaries Commission from going ahead with the the BBl or subjecting it to a referendum. The Bill had already been approved by parliament. The judges also upheld the High Court\u2019s finding that the president has no authority to promote amendment of the constitution through a popular initiative and that he can be sued with respect to his actions or omissions in the constitution. Those in the know claim, the Court of Appeal judges with the input of well known lawyers wanted to hold Uhuru at ransom by the ruling the head of state can be sued the moment he retires as president. Keen observers will also agree, in Kinoti ruling, the issue of being jailed once his tenure at DCI ends was was also cleverly inserted. As Uhuru was nursing wounds from the BBI ruling, another shock was awaiting him a move that saw Court of Appeal temporarily suspended an order directing him to swear in six judges within two weeks.\n\nJustices Roselyn Nambuye, Wanjiru Karanja and Imaana Laibuta granted the orders after the president rushed to the appellate court on grounds, there is an eminent danger of embarrassment and uncertainty in the dispensation of justice, if the directive remains unchallenged. The word embarrassment in the petition speaks volumes. The president\u2019s move came after a bench of three judges of the High Court gave Uhuru two weeks to swear in the judges, failure to which they will assume the positions after being sworn in by Chief Justice Martha Koome. The six judges left out when Uhuru appointed 34 others are High Court judges Aggrey Muchelule, George Odunga, Weldon Korir and Joel Ngugi. The four had been recommended by Judicial Service Commission to join the appellate court.\n\nUhuru also left out chief magistrate Evans Makori and High Court registrar Judith Omange, who were recommended to be judges of the Labour Court. Uhuru\u2019s move to decline to swear them is said to have been based on intelligence briefs on matters relating to corruption. Those we talked to revealed, the rot in the Judiciary has gained grounds but rotates around a section of well connected traditional judges that have links with powerful lawyers. They have been on the bench for years. The truth of the matter is, not all judges are corrupt but just a few rotten ones that are tainting its image. They have influence at JSC and are untouchables. JSC is as per now a toothless dog which cannot bite as Judges run to courts to block disciplinary actions. The said Judges petitions surprisingly land in hands for friendly faces. Kinoti\u2019s other troubles was when he arrested justices Juma Chitembwe and Aggrey Muchelule over a Sh6.3 million bribe and abuse of office. The two swiftly moved to High Court and Justice James Makau gave orders on July 23 2021 stopping their prosecution. The orders are to remain in force up to February 21 2022 when a case filed by the Kenya Judges and Magistrates Association will be mentioned for directions on hearing. KJMA secretary-general is Derrick Kuto with LSK president Nelson Havi. The detectives alleged that they had information the judges had received bribes from some brokers with the intention of obtaining favourable judgments, and that the money was stored in their chambers.\nDuring the raid, police found $50,000 in the chamber of Justice Muchelule and $7,000 was recovered from Justice Chitembwe. DCI received intelligence on July 21 at 3pm that after a series of meetings between certain judges and the brokers a Sh7 million bribe had been agreed upon and it was to be delivered to the residence of a judge at 7pm. The DCI further claims that $50,000 was seized from a woman who was in Justice Muchelule\u2019s Chamber 230 during the search, and $7,000 was seized from Justice Chitembwe who is alleged to have facilitated the meeting. Justice Muchelule was on his way to deliver pending judgments, while Justice Chitembwe was attending to a law student when detectives stormed their offices that are just a wall apart and arrested them.Judge Chitembwe however admits that he was found with $7,000 in his pocket which he says was meant for payment of school fees of his son who is studying at Edith Cowan University, Perth Australia. Questions are being asked why the judge did not transfer the said money to the son\u2019s account but decided to walk around with it in his office. Chitembwe family operates a foreign currency account under his wife\u2019s name. Detectives searched both offices before taking them to the DCI headquarters for questioning. There is talk among lawyers that some of their colleagues cannot win any case in court without bribing. The said lawyers are now at the forefront of defending judges implicated in corruption. Kinoti was dealt a blow after the High Court declined to set aside the four-month prison sentence imposed on him for disobeying a court order requiring him to surrender firearms belonging to controversial businessman Jimi Wanjigi.\n\nJustice Antony Mrima ruled the orders he made on November 18 for Kinoti to present himself to prison should be complied with. Kinoti had through lawyer Cecil Miller asked the court to set aside the sentence on grounds that he was wrongly enjoined in the case as he was not in possession of the firearms in question. An attempt by Attorney General Kihara Kariuki to quash the imprisonment also failed. Also on Kinoti\u2019s radar is Court of Appeal judge Sankale ole Kantai who is accused of participating in the planning and cover up of the murder of Dutch national Tob Cohen. The judge is said to have had sexual escapades with Cohen\u2019s wife, Sarah Wairimu, who is the main suspect in the murder. Insiders revealed that the judges have teamed up with prominent lawyers to ensure Kinoti is jailed for arresting their colleagues. For Mwilu, she is bitter with Kinoti for leading her arrest at the Supreme Court where she was then taken to DCI headquarters for questioning over graft. After the arrest, Mwilu was escorted by Kinoti to the DCI headquarters. Mwilu was accused of obtaining execution of a security belonging to Imperial Bank Limited by false pretense and unlawfully failing to pay taxes. Mwilu closed irregular property deals worth Sh315 million with the collapsed Imperial Bank. Justice Mwilu secured all these multimillion loan dealings just three months before Imperial Bank was put on receivership.\n\nImperial Bank was placed under receivership in October 2015, after its board alerted Capital Markets Authorities of suspected malpractices. She acquired properties through backdoor deals that have now been linked to tax evasion by DPP\u2019s prosecution team. Mwilu sold the three parcels of land for Sh315 million in suspicious deals made between March 2016 and July 2016. She also failed to pay stamp duty of 4pc on value of the land she had bought via Imperial Bank between December 2014 and March 2016 for Sh160 million. Justice Mwilu\u2019s Sh132 million loans were granted interest free without written applications. Justice Mwilu did not appraise her creditworthiness for interest free loans that were granted using letters with Judiciary letters head.\n\nJustice Mwilu also fraudulently recovered securities of the said loans and sold them at a profit that directly led to losses of Sh60 million at the collapsed Imperial Bank. This is has been proven without doubt that Mwilu used her position at the Judicial office to improperly enrich herself. Justice Mwilu bought two plots in Nairobi for Sh80 million in December 2014; plot ref number 3734/202 and plot ref number 3734/209. It has also been revealed that Justice Mwilu took another short-term loan of Sh60 million for purchase of half-acre property registered under 3734/1129. This is coming at a time when three appellate judges had just overturned a decision of the High Court barring the CMA from investigating circumstances under which Imperial Bank proceeded with a bond despite insider knowledge it was at the collapsing edge. To complicate matters, Mwilu\u2019s case was to land before a three-judge bench of the Constitutional Court.\n\nThe court has been asked to dismiss a case by Mwilu because she is trying to defeat justice by not appearing before the Judicial Service Commission. Justice Mwilu had filed a case before the court to stop the JSC from hearing four disciplinary cases against her. The case is being heard by Chitembwe, Roselyne Aburili and Weldon Korir. Lawyers Lynn Nyangweso and Charles Kanjama argue, the DCJ failed to exhaust all the available mechanisms of dispute resolution before approaching the court. According to the two lawyers, Justice Mwilu ought to have let the proceedings before the JSC be completed before she could approach the court for remedy. Justice Mwilu\u2019s application before the JSC for recusal of commissioners Kihara Kariuki and Macharia Njeru was heard and dismissed. Two JSC commissioners are said to have found after weighing evidence that the application for their recusal lacked merit and declined to step aside from hearing disciplinary proceedings against Justice Mwilu. The two also questioned why Justice Mwilu took a year and one month to challenge proceedings before the JSC even when she knew there was a time limit of six months within which such action ought to be taken. The JSC had been temporarily stopped from conducting disciplinary proceedings against Mwilu, who is one of its members. But she rushed to the High Court which declared she would not be prosecuted as the evidence by the DCI was illegally obtained. The five-judge bench quashed the criminal case on that ground. The bench said the DCI violated Mwilu\u2019s right to privacy by the manner in which it obtained its evidence by accessing her IBL accounts. Mwilu was represented by Havi while Justices William Musyoki, Mumbi Ngugi, Hellen Omondi, Francis Tuiyott and Chacha Mwita made the ruling. At the moment, the Director of Public Prosecutions Noordin Haji is fighting orders barring disciplinary proceedings against Mwilu. Haji is challenging the order issued by High Court judge Weldon Korir on August 17 after a successful application by Mwilu that stopped the Judicial Service Commission from instituting disciplinary proceedings against her. Back to Justice Kantai case, he was linked to Cohen\u2019s murder by a senior detective attached to DCI identified as John Gachomo. Gachomo stated the judge held several secret meetings with Sarah Wairimu, who was the wife to the late Cohen. They met in various places, dates and locations where they planned the murder of Cohen whose body was found inside his compound in Kitusuru Estate. Gachomo, who is a senior assistant Inspector General of Police based at the DCI headquarters, claimed Judge Kantai fully participated in the murder. In court documents, the DCI also blamed the office of the Director of Public Prosecution for trying to terminate the investigation with the aim of not charging the judge. In a move aimed at proving why DCI believed that Kantai was part of the scheme, Gachomo said the judge fraudulently transferred shares of a company that was being run by Cohen from Silas Itas before eventually transferring them to Wairimu. He said Cohen could later be killed two days after the fraudulent transfer was discovered.\n\n\u201cCohen was murdered barely two days after the discovery of the fraudulent transfer involving the petitioner and Wairimu. The discovery of the fraud is the motive of Cohen\u2019s death,\u201d the documents filed in court read in part. Gachomo also said the DCI had established that the judge heightened his communication with Wairimu who is the main suspect in the murder of Cohen. In his argument, Kantai had filed a petition saying he was in good terms with Cohen who was his client and close confidant to an extent of entrusting him with his investment. However, DCI believes at no point did Cohen agree that Kantai should have shares of his company. Detectives also believe that Wairimu was the judge\u2019s mistress a relationship they had even before Cohen passed on. Cohen was murdered on either July 19 2020 and his body hidden in a septic tank within his compound until it was discovered by detectives. Insiders added that the cartel has made justice for sale to the highest bidder. To execute the scheme, the prominent lawyers engage in what is called Forum Shopping, a colloquial term for the practice of litigants having their legal cases heard by a friendly judge who will most likely rule in favour of their clients. Insiders revealed that the game plan is to hide material facts in courts to either secure conviction or freedom of the suspects represented by the said lawyers. For instance in Kinoti case, Wanjigi in his petition failed to disclose to the court that the Firearm Licensing Board is the body that keeps custody of guns for civilians and that once such guns are seized, they can only be got from them and not DCI headquarters.\n\nAlready, the ministry of Interior and Coordination of National Government has written to Wanjigi requiring him to present himself to the FLB to get his firearms back. The ministry acknowledged receipt of a court order Wanjigi attached in his letter demanding to be given the dangerous firearms. But it noted that the board is an independent body mandated by constitution deal with licensing of firearms to the civilian. The ministry noted that it is the mandate of board to issue firearms to civilians, noting that matter was litigated in court in the absence of the board which could have helped the court to arrive at a reasonable determination. It noted that the National Police\nService does not store firearms or keep and or deal with civilian firearms as alleged in the Petition 520 of 2017 filed by Wanjigi. \u201cWe find this mischievous, from now henceforth kindly consider dealing with the board directly,\u201d the\nletter signed by Daniel Seme, states. It is also emerging that Wanjigi attempted to bribe a Jubilee activist Mike Makarina with Sh5 million to trap Kinoti and subsequently have him jailed. The activist, who is also chairman of Person Living with Disabilities in Meru county, is on record claiming he was promised Sh5 million to hide documents in order to put Kinoti behind bars. The developments come amidst a petition filed at the Judicial Review Division seeking to compel Kinoti to arrest Wanjigi for being in possession of illegal firearms and ammunition. According to documents filed in court, Memba Ocharo argues Wanjigi\u2019s conduct has previously been questionable hence he should not be allowed to possess the firearms. The petitioner claims long after Wanjigi was dismissed from employment with the Police Service\nfor misuse of firearms in threatening and intimidating members of the public, he has nonetheless been a licensed firearms holder until January 30, 2018, when the firearm licensing board revoked his firearms\u2019 certificate. The question is, will Koome manage the pressure from the gang and survive. Remember Ahmed Nasir and Maraga bitter court wars.", "articleBodyHtml": "<article>\n\n<p>News Article Page Views:\n\t\t\t\t349</p>\n\n<p>The jailing of DCI boss George Kinoti is seen from certain quarters as part of a wider scheme by Court of Appeal and High Court judges in cahoots with prominent lawyers to hit back at Kinoti for arresting some of them over graft. The idea is to scare institutions that have the powers, influence and control over the operations within the Judiciary to shy off and thus allow the rampant graft in the judiciary to proceed unabated. What Kinoti failed to understand was, when he arrested Deputy Chief Justice Philomena Mwilu, he had stepped on wrong toes of the cartel that also has lawyers commonly referred to as the Karen gang. They were grooming Mwilu to succeed then Chief Justice David Maraga. The arrest and prosecution blocked the gang ill motives. They were forced to start marketing lawyer Fred Ngatia as Maraga successor.</p>\n\n<figure><img src=\"https://weeklycitizen.co.ke/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/kinoti-300x240.png\" alt=\"\" srcset=\"https://weeklycitizen.co.ke/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/kinoti-300x240.png 300w, https://weeklycitizen.co.ke/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/kinoti.png 720w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 300px) 100vw, 300px\"><figcaption><p>George Kinoti</p></figcaption><br><br>The emergency of Martha Koome on the scene caught them unawares. For them, Chief Justice Koome is a state project being used to have Judicial Service Commission (JSC) fix Mwilu and force her retire from the office to avoid embarrassment. By fronting Ngatia, the cartel were out to portray him as state house favoured face by virtue of having been president Uhuru Kenyatta lawyer at Supreme Court presidential petition. In fact, word has it, Ngatia link with the cartel costed him dearly. It is not only Koome and Kinoti the cartel has marked. It was to be business as usual with Mwilu or Ngatia at helm. Sources say, the most lucrative court is that of Appeal hence the current happenings on the blocked appointments by Uhuru Kenyatta. The first target is president Uhuru Kenyatta who has no kind words for Kenyan judiciary. Uhuru has seen most of his directives being overturned by judges putting the offices of his legal advisers into question as to whether they are up to the game or just victims of the supremacy war between the executive and judiciary. The war between Uhuru and judges got ugly during the Building Bridges Initiative Court of Appeal ruling that gave window for the arrest of Uhuru in near future for having acted unconstitutionally. In the judgment, the Court of Appeal was heavily critical to Uhuru stating that the BBI Bill was unconstitutional and usurped the people\u2019s sovereign power. The seven-judge bench also issued a permanent injunction against Independent and Electoral Boundaries Commission from going ahead with the the BBl or subjecting it to a referendum. The Bill had already been approved by parliament. The judges also upheld the High Court\u2019s finding that the president has no authority to promote amendment of the constitution through a popular initiative and that he can be sued with respect to his actions or omissions in the constitution. Those in the know claim, the Court of Appeal judges with the input of well known lawyers wanted to hold Uhuru at ransom by the ruling the head of state can be sued the moment he retires as president. Keen observers will also agree, in Kinoti ruling, the issue of being jailed once his tenure at DCI ends was was also cleverly inserted. As Uhuru was nursing wounds from the BBI ruling, another shock was awaiting him a move that saw Court of Appeal temporarily suspended an order directing him to swear in six judges within two weeks.<br><br></figure>\n\n<p>Justices Roselyn Nambuye, Wanjiru Karanja and Imaana Laibuta granted the orders after the president rushed to the appellate court on grounds, there is an eminent danger of embarrassment and uncertainty in the dispensation of justice, if the directive remains unchallenged. The word embarrassment in the petition speaks volumes. The president\u2019s move came after a bench of three judges of the High Court gave Uhuru two weeks to swear in the judges, failure to which they will assume the positions after being sworn in by Chief Justice Martha Koome. The six judges left out when Uhuru appointed 34 others are High Court judges Aggrey Muchelule, George Odunga, Weldon Korir and Joel Ngugi. The four had been recommended by Judicial Service Commission to join the appellate court.</p>\n\n<figure><img src=\"https://weeklycitizen.co.ke/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/ngatia-300x200.jpg\" alt=\"\" srcset=\"https://weeklycitizen.co.ke/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/ngatia-300x200.jpg 300w, https://weeklycitizen.co.ke/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/ngatia.jpg 700w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 300px) 100vw, 300px\"><figcaption><p>Fred Ngatia</p></figcaption><br><br> Uhuru also left out chief magistrate Evans Makori and High Court registrar Judith Omange, who were recommended to be judges of the Labour Court. Uhuru\u2019s move to decline to swear them is said to have been based on intelligence briefs on matters relating to corruption. Those we talked to revealed, the rot in the Judiciary has gained grounds but rotates around a section of well connected traditional judges that have links with powerful lawyers. They have been on the bench for years. The truth of the matter is, not all judges are corrupt but just a few rotten ones that are tainting its image. They have influence at JSC and are untouchables. JSC is as per now a toothless dog which cannot bite as Judges run to courts to block disciplinary actions. The said Judges petitions surprisingly land in hands for friendly faces. Kinoti\u2019s other troubles was when he arrested justices Juma Chitembwe and Aggrey Muchelule over a Sh6.3 million bribe and abuse of office. The two swiftly moved to High Court and Justice James Makau gave orders on July 23 2021 stopping their prosecution. The orders are to remain in force up to February 21 2022 when a case filed by the Kenya Judges and Magistrates Association will be mentioned for directions on hearing. KJMA secretary-general is Derrick Kuto with LSK president Nelson Havi. The detectives alleged that they had information the judges had received bribes from some brokers with the intention of obtaining favourable judgments, and that the money was stored in their chambers.<br><br><br><br> During the raid, police found $50,000 in the chamber of Justice Muchelule and $7,000 was recovered from Justice Chitembwe.

The Jubilee supporters who have rallied behind William Ruto are accusing Omar of arrogance and discrimination, vowing to campaign for another aspirant if UDA insists on fronting him for the governor seat. \u201cOmar has refused to embrace all supporters of the DP in Mombasa. He only wants to work with a few sidekicks and behaves as if UDA is his personal property. The party is very popular here but we don\u2019t have a strong and credible governor candidate to unite us,\u201d said Ali Mwatsahu who is eyeing the Mvita parliamentary seat on UDA ticket. Mwatsahu claims that if Nyali MP Mohamed Ali aka Jicho Pevu is fronted as the governor aspirant, the seat would be as good as taken ahead of the next general elections.

They found men\u2019s clothing, an unknown amount of cash, a passport and an underwear white in colour.</p>\n\n<p>Though there were varied speculations on the real cause of the incident that almost brought activities to a complete stop, sources finally unraveled that the owner of the items in the bag had protected himself from thieves. It is believed that he is using powerful black magic spells which are mostly used to nab thieves or people who have conned others their cash and valuables.</p>\n\n<p>In most cases, thieves would be found either stuck in the house or shop they just broke into, some would be found in deep sleep once they enter a building, some would be found with stolen items stuck on their head while some will be send bees to attack them along the way.</p>\n\n<p>It only takes an intervention of another traditional herbalist like DOCTOR NGOSO to bring back the situation to normal. Doctor Ngoso who is a renowned African herbalist is known for treating asthma, solving court cases, winning jackpots as well as promotion at work. He also delves in love and marriage matters.</p>\n\n</article>", "canonicalUrl": "https://weeklycitizen.co.ke/revealed-why-this-beautiful-woman-was-attacked-by-bees-at-the-bus-park/"},{"url": "https://weeklycitizen.co.ke/how-has-technology-changed-the-online-casino-industry/", "probability": 0.95626193, "headline": "How Has Technology Changed the Online Casino Industry?", "datePublished": "2020-09-08T00:00:00", "datePublishedRaw": "2020-09-08EAT17:53:00", "author": "Weekly Citizen", "authorsList": ["Weekly Citizen"], "inLanguage": "en", "breadcrumbs": [{"name": "Football News", "link": "https://weeklycitizen.co.ke/category/sports/football-news/"}, {"name": "Lifestyle", "link": "https://weeklycitizen.co.ke/category/lifestyle/"}, {"name": "Sports", "link": "https://weeklycitizen.co.ke/category/sports/"}, {"name": "Technology", "link": "https://weeklycitizen.co.ke/category/lifestyle/technology/"}, {"name": "Uncategorized", "link": "https://weeklycitizen.co.ke/category/uncategorized/"}, {"name": "5"}], "mainImage": "https://weeklycitizen.co.ke/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/thumb.jpg", "images": ["https://weeklycitizen.co.ke/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/thumb.jpg"], "description": "The online casino industry has been a big beneficiary of technological advancements such as faster internet connections and the availability of sophisticated gadgets.

For instance, Musila some weeks back had been the guest on Kamba language television station Mutongoi TV where he went out of his way to show how one Kenya Alliance of Kalonzo, Musalia\nMudavadi, Moses Wetangula and Gideon Moi stood a good chance of winning the next elections. Even as the host determined\nby created the impression that there were only two horses in the race that of UDA\u2019s William Ruto and ODM\u2019s Raila Odinga, Musila doggedly expressed optimism that OKA would make a mark and that it is still too early. Many who had heard that Musila would be on television had expected to see a fire spitting man direct flames on Kalonzo but were shocked to see a mellowed down man who had everything good to say about Kalonzo. This must have sent alarm bells\nringing in the Malombe camp as Malombe has been the beneficiary of Kalonzo, Musila fallout.

Ngilu was to top the race with Musila a close second and Malombe a distant third but their votes combined were by far more than Ngilu\u2019s meaning that had they not competed against eath other, and were they in one camp, one of them would have carried the day. Indeed, it is said that Musila decided to run as an independent to punish Kalonzo by denying him the votes that would have made his men Malombe beat Ngilu. Although Kalonzo had not been happy that Musila was abandoning his senate seat to contest for governor, he had nonetheless assured Musila that the nomination process would be fair. It was only after he won and was denied the ticket that Musila realised that there was another side of Kalonzo that he did not know, be embittered with Kalonzo was Musila that he wrote a book in which he exposed Kalonzo as dishonest and untrustworthy. He in the book revisited some past incidents that should have been wakeup calls for him that he was dealing with a dangerous man.\n\nMusila wrote how one time he had taken Kalonzo to the United Arab Emirates where he know some people who knew the either and who had agreed to fund Kalonzo\u2019s 2007 presidential bid. When Kalonzo was finally taken to the office of the big man, the protocol people there had Musila remain outside because after all Kalonzo was the presidential candidate. When Kalonzo came out, he did not tell Musila how much he had been given as he assumed that Kalonzo would volunteer the information, Kalonzo however never uttered a word about the petro dollars he had received courtesy of Musila\u2019s connections. Another time, Musila writes, he had taken Kalonzo to Libya to ask for financial help for the same 2007 elections whereby they had to chase after Muamar Gaddafi for four days before they finally caught up with him at his rural home where they were invited into a tent but only Kalonzo had the chance to meet the supreme leader. When Kalonzo emerged from the tent, Musila who had learnt from the Dubai trip that Kalonzo never gives out information on money he receives without being asked how much he got, asked Kalonzo to which Kalonzo replied that he would tell him later. Kalonzo has never up today told Musila how much Gaddafi gave him. It is a tiff that Ngilu wished would continue for good so that she keeps on capitalising on it. Should Kalonzo somehow find a way of balancing the two friends and have only one go for the seat of governor, Ngilu\u2019s goose would be cooked. It is an eventuality that Ngilu knows all too well as demonstrated by the fact Wiper has majority MCAs in the county to Narc\u2019s handful which is to mean that Ngilu enjoys support from only a small fraction of Kitui people. But whereas Ngilu is a known foe of Kalonzo and so she would expect Kalonzo to come up with all manner of dirty schemes to stall her political train, it is Malombe who is at a loss of wht to make of the development. It is worth noting that Malombe had just stared reviewing his campaigns in readiness for a run that he was sure Kalonzo was going to be supportive of. It is thus understandable that Malombe feels such a deep sense of betrayal by Kalonzo. In a fair contest, Malombe has no chance of defeating the elderly Musila whom everyone had thought had gone to retire. There are even those who say that Malombe could decide to throw his weight behind Ngilu in 2022 in a deal that would see Ngilu support him in 2027 when she will be retiring if she wins in 2022. Another person who has been unhappy with the Musila return is Kiema Kilonzo who would have wished it was him Kalonzo was now hobnobbing with instead of Musila.

In the last general elections, Uhuru Kenyatta got a whooping 42,208 votes translated to 92.94pc of total votes cast while Raila came a distant second with a paltry 2,456, which was 5.41pc. In the six constituencies, both Jubilee and ODM got three seats each. The county has Samuel Poghisio of Kanu as the senator and governor Nanok of ODM. The 2017 gubernatorial elections was a two-horse race between Nanok who, together with running mate Peter Lotethiro, got 76,209 while Munyes and running mate Peter Ekai got 55,507 votes.\n\nPoghisio was not present further raising eyebrows. During the visit, Raila, who was accompanied by Munyes, had to forego several meetings after it became apparent that the BBI was not saleable in the semi arid area.

The governor said that he had a problem with revenue sharing as proposed by the BBI claiming that the county would lose out in the proposed revenue sharing formula.

Raila was accompanied by MPs Maina Kamanda (nominated), Godfrey Otsosi (nominated), Gladys Wanga (Homa Bay woman representative), Mishi Mbogo (Likoni), Babu Owino (Embakasi East), Caleb Hamisi (Saboti) and Munyes, who is also Mining cabinet secretary.</p>\n\n<figure><img src=\"https://weeklycitizen.co.ke/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/munyes.jpg\" alt=\"\" srcset=\"https://weeklycitizen.co.ke/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/munyes.jpg 180w, https://weeklycitizen.co.ke/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/munyes-150x150.jpg 150w, https://weeklycitizen.co.ke/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/munyes-60x60.jpg 60w, https://weeklycitizen.co.ke/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/munyes-90x90.jpg 90w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 180px) 100vw, 180px\"><figcaption><p>John Munyes</p></figcaption></figure>\n\n<p>While the ODM boss was in Kakuma in Turkana East, Governor Nanok held a parallel rally at Lowarang\u2019ek in the neighbouring Turkana North hosted by area MP Doye. According to the 2017 Independent Electoral and Boundaries Commission voter register, Turkana county had 191,435 registered voters. In the last general elections, Uhuru Kenyatta got a whooping 42,208 votes translated to 92.94pc of total votes cast while Raila came a distant second with a paltry 2,456, which was 5.41pc. In the six constituencies, both Jubilee and ODM got three seats each. The county has Samuel Poghisio of Kanu as the senator and governor Nanok of ODM. The 2017 gubernatorial elections was a two-horse race between Nanok who, together with running mate Peter Lotethiro, got 76,209 while Munyes and running mate Peter Ekai got 55,507 votes.</p>\n\n<p>Poghisio was not present further raising eyebrows. During the visit, Raila, who was accompanied by Munyes, had to forego several meetings after it became apparent that the BBI was not saleable in the semi arid area. According to Governor Nanok, the county is marginalised and only attracts attention during electioneering periods. The governor, while addressing a mammoth crowd in Turkana North, said Raila had taken the Turkana people for a ride over a long period. Nanok used the occasion to declare his support for the newly formed United Democratic Alliance party that is associated with deputy president William Ruto. The ODM leader clashed with Nanok last week at St Augustine Catholic Church, Lodwar.</p>\n\n<p>Jeremiah Lomurkai</p>\n\n<p>The two were attending a mass at the church when Nanok took on Raila for not agreeing to a multiple-choice option in the upcoming BBI referendum. Nanok told Raila that he was ready to join another political party because the views of the Turkana residents and leaders were not captured in the BBI constitutional amendment proposal. The governor said that he had a problem with revenue sharing as proposed by the BBI claiming that the county would lose out in the proposed revenue sharing formula. The bad blood between Raila and Nanok was well manifested when, while the ODM leader was in Kakuma, Turkana East campaigning for BBI, the governor had pitched tent in Lowarangek in Turkana North constituency.</p>\n\n</article>", "canonicalUrl": "https://weeklycitizen.co.ke/which-way-turkana-politics-after-raila-nanok-confrontation/"},{"url": "https://weeklycitizen.co.ke/turkana-leaders-now-demand-local-heads-varsity/", "probability": 0.93170327, "headline": "Turkana leaders now demand local heads varsity", "datePublished": "2020-05-11T00:00:00", "datePublishedRaw": "May 11, 2020", "author": "Weekly Citizen", "authorsList": ["Weekly Citizen"], "inLanguage": "en", "mainImage": "https://weeklycitizen.co.ke/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/nanok.jpg", "images": ["https://weeklycitizen.co.ke/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/nanok.jpg", "https://weeklycitizen.co.ke/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/ekal.jpg", "https://weeklycitizen.co.ke/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/akuja.jpg"], "description": "A section of Turkana county leaders are now demanding the reinstatement of suspended Turkana University College principal Thomas Akuja.

Already insiders and party loyalists at Orange house believe that a fallout during the Kisumu county gubernatorial primaries could weigh heavily against the party of Raila Odinga who is angling for State House as the country\u2019s fifth president. Kisumu politics is emerging as Raila big headache.\n\nThose opposed to Governor Anyang Nyong\u2019o believe that the incumbent who enjoys a cordial relationship with Raila will be his automatic choice hence an inevitable protest vote which many politicians dread. Impeccable sources from party rank and file have confided in Weekly Citizen that Raila has been weighing the possibility of having a compromise candidate should Nyong\u2019o face\nrebellion after his nomination. Shopping for a suitable replacement for Nyong\u2019o ahead of 2022 is part of Raila\u2019s plan B. Among others eyeing the seat are Nyong\u2019o predecessor Jack Ranguma and a former chief finance officer during Ranguma\u2019s tenure Kephas Kacera, Polycarp Ochola and Hezron MacObewa.\nKen Obura is also in the race. Raila is at the moment still clinging on Nyong\u2019o since the governor is at the moment taking care of his financial interests. It has since emerged that Nyong\u2019o started falling out of favour with ODM hardliners after he declined to appoint Odoyo as the county public service board chairman in favour of Elijah Adul who hails from Seme constituency where the governor\nhappens to also come from. A former aide in Nyong\u2019o\u2019s office when he was the senator Babu Karan later became the county board chairman. Party diehards feel that Nyong\u2019o has never been an ardent supporter of Raila from the days he ditched Ford-K for the Social Democratic Party. Nyong\u2019o vied for the Kisumu Rural constituency during the 1997 general\nelections on a SDP ticket and lost to NDP\u2019s Ochoro Ayoki.\n\nNyong\u2019o came distant third after Ayoki and Kanu\u2019s Ndolo Ayah. He eventually secured a SDP nomination to parliament courtesy of his support for the party presidential flagbearer Charity Ngilu. Nyong\u2019o made a comeback during the 2002 polls and won the seat after decamping from SDP. He retained it after the 2007 polls. Odoyo is a chief administrative secretary in the ministry of Defense as a beneficiary of the handshake between Uhuru Kenyatta and Raila. Since Nyakach is known for supporting their own when it comes to leadership issues he can bank on this and with Raila\u2019s support he can mount a serious bid. It will be interesting to see how Nyakach politics unfolds since Tom Ojienda has already declared his interest in the senate seat held by Fred Outa who is going for the gubernatorial position. Mathew Owili who also hails from Nyakach is the deputy governor and has insisted that Nyong\u2019o will go to the polls with his lineup intact. At the same time various combatants are now positioning themselves ahead of the Kisumu county 2022 gubernatorial contest as both antagonists and protagonists dig\nin. Early campaigns have gripped the county. Various factors will come into play, key amongst them being Raila\u2019s 2022 presidential bid, clannism, generation change, individual past roles in public life candidates professional achievements and ODM party primary\u2019s management and outcome. Nyong\u2019o is a seasoned politician who is credited for being instrumental in the formation of ODM party. He became the Kisumu county governor in an acrimonious after bungled party primaries where he was declared the winner. He survived the subsequent election petition that was filed by Ranguma.\nHis critics claim he is an untrustworthy fellow, arrogant, self-centered, highly opinionated and does not respect people without university degrees a fact that can be seen in his cabinet appointees where all non-graduates have been sacked and replaced by Phd and Masters holders. The popular ODM support that he used to ride to power has waned drastically leading to Nyong\u2019o becoming unpopular with both the public and leaders within the county. He has fallen out with all the leading lights in his 2017 bid a factor that has made Outa become his ardent critic and will take any available opportunity to spew venom at his administration.", "articleBodyHtml": "<article>\n\n<p>News Article Page Views:\n\t\t\t\t598</p>\n\n<p>Kisumu county politics is again expected to shift with a fresh push to have former Nyakach MP Peter Odoyo join gubernatorial race.

Kisumu politics is emerging as Raila big headache.</p>\n\n<figure><figcaption><p>Peter Odoyo</p></figcaption><br><br> Those opposed to Governor Anyang Nyong\u2019o believe that the incumbent who enjoys a cordial relationship with Raila will be his automatic choice hence an inevitable protest vote which many politicians dread. Impeccable sources from party rank and file have confided in Weekly Citizen that Raila has been weighing the possibility of having a compromise candidate should Nyong\u2019o face<br>\nrebellion after his nomination. Shopping for a suitable replacement for Nyong\u2019o ahead of 2022 is part of Raila\u2019s plan B. Among others eyeing the seat are Nyong\u2019o predecessor Jack Ranguma and a former chief finance officer during Ranguma\u2019s tenure Kephas Kacera, Polycarp Ochola and Hezron MacObewa. <br><br><br><br>Ken Obura is also in the race. Raila is at the moment still clinging on Nyong\u2019o since the governor is at the moment taking care of his financial interests. It has since emerged that Nyong\u2019o started falling out of favour with ODM hardliners after he declined to appoint Odoyo as the county public service board chairman in favour of Elijah Adul who hails from Seme constituency where the governor<br>\nhappens to also come from. A former aide in Nyong\u2019o\u2019s office when he was the senator Babu Karan later became the county board chairman. Party diehards feel that Nyong\u2019o has never been an ardent supporter of Raila from the days he ditched Ford-K for the Social Democratic Party. Nyong\u2019o vied for the Kisumu Rural constituency during the 1997 general<br>\nelections on a SDP ticket and lost to NDP\u2019s Ochoro Ayoki.<br><br></figure>\n\n<p>Nyong\u2019o came distant third after Ayoki and Kanu\u2019s Ndolo Ayah. He eventually secured a SDP nomination to parliament courtesy of his support for the party presidential flagbearer Charity Ngilu. Nyong\u2019o made a comeback during the 2002 polls and won the seat after decamping from SDP. He retained it after the 2007 polls. Odoyo is a chief administrative secretary in the ministry of Defense as a beneficiary of the handshake between Uhuru Kenyatta and Raila. Since Nyakach is known for supporting their own when it comes to leadership issues he can bank on this and with Raila\u2019s support he can mount a serious bid. It will be interesting to see how Nyakach politics unfolds since Tom Ojienda has already declared his interest in the senate seat held by Fred Outa who is going for the gubernatorial position. Mathew Owili who also hails from Nyakach is the deputy governor and has insisted that Nyong\u2019o will go to the polls with his lineup intact. At the same time various combatants are now positioning themselves ahead of the Kisumu county 2022 gubernatorial contest as both antagonists and protagonists dig<br>\nin. Early campaigns have gripped the county. Various factors will come into play, key amongst them being Raila\u2019s 2022 presidential bid, clannism, generation change, individual past roles in public life candidates professional achievements and ODM party primary\u2019s management and outcome. Nyong\u2019o is a seasoned politician who is credited for being instrumental in the formation of ODM party. He became the Kisumu county governor in an acrimonious after bungled party primaries where he was declared the winner. He survived the subsequent election petition that was filed by Ranguma.<br>\nHis critics claim he is an untrustworthy fellow, arrogant, self-centered, highly opinionated and does not respect people without university degrees a fact that can be seen in his cabinet appointees where all non-graduates have been sacked and replaced by Phd and Masters holders. The popular ODM support that he used to ride to power has waned drastically leading to Nyong\u2019o becoming unpopular with both the public and leaders within the county. He has fallen out with all the leading lights in his 2017 bid a factor that has made Outa become his ardent critic and will take any available opportunity to spew venom at his administration.</p>\n\n</article>", "canonicalUrl": "https://weeklycitizen.co.ke/kisumu-politics-big-headache-for-raila/"},{"url": "https://weeklycitizen.co.ke/kinoti-the-hunter-who-has-become-the-prey/", "probability": 0.9720624, "headline": "Kinoti: The hunter who has become the prey", "datePublished": "2021-12-04T00:00:00", "datePublishedRaw": "December 4, 2021", "author": "Weekly Citizen", "authorsList": ["Weekly Citizen"], "inLanguage": "en", "mainImage": "https://weeklycitizen.co.ke/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/kinoti-720x454.png", "images": ["https://weeklycitizen.co.ke/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/kinoti-720x454.png", "https://weeklycitizen.co.ke/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/images-300x213.jpeg", "https://weeklycitizen.co.ke/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/koome.jpg", "https://weeklycitizen.co.ke/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/jimmy.jpg", "https://weeklycitizen.co.ke/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/muchelule-300x225.jpeg", "https://weeklycitizen.co.ke/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/chitembwe.jpg", "https://weeklycitizen.co.ke/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/odunga-300x154.jpg", "https://weeklycitizen.co.ke/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/maraga-d.jpg", "https://weeklycitizen.co.ke/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/fred-ngatia.jpg"], "description": "Ali Nur The jailing of Directorate of Criminal Investigations boss George Kinoti is seen from certain quarters as part of a wider scheme by Court of Appeal and High Court judges in cahoots with prominent lawyers to hit back at Kinoti for arresting some of them over graft.

It was to be business as usual with Mwilu or Ngatia at helm.\n\nSources say,the most lucrative court is that of Appeal hence the current happpenings on the blocked appointments by Uhuru Kenyatta.\n\nThe first target is president Uhuru Kenyatta who has no kind words for Kenyan judiciary. Uhuru has seen most of his directives being overturned by judges putting the offices of his legal advisers into question as to whether they are up to the game or just victims of the supremacy war between the executive and judiciary. The war between Uhuru and judges got ugly during the Building Bridges Initiative Court of Appeal ruling that gave window for the arrest of Uhuru in near future for having acted unconstitutionally.\n\nIn the judgment, the Court of Appeal was heavily critical to Uhuru stating that the BBI Bill was unconstitutional and usurped the people\u2019s sovereign power.\n\nThe seven-judge bench also issued a permanent injunction against Independent and Electoral Boundaries Commission from going ahead with the the BBl or subjecting it to a referendum. The Bill had already been approved by parliament.\n\nThe judges also upheld the High Court\u2019s finding that the president has no authority to promote amendment of the constitution through a popular initiative and that he can be sued with respect to his actions or omissions in the constitution. Those in the know claim, the Court of Appeal judges with the input of well known lawyers wanted to hold Uhuru at ransom by the ruling the head of state can be sued the moment he retires as president.\n\nKeen observers will also agree, in Kinoti ruling, the issue of being jailed once his tenure at DCI ends was was also cleverly inserted.\n\nAs Uhuru was nursing wounds from the BBI ruling, another shock was awaiting him a move that saw Court of Appeal temporarily suspended an order directing him to swear in six judges within two weeks.\n\nJustices Roselyn Nambuye, Wanjiru Karanja and Imaana Laibuta granted the orders after the president rushed to the appellate court on grounds, there is an eminent danger of embarrassment and uncertainty in the dispensation of justice, if the directive remains unchallenged. The word embarrassment in the petition speaks volumes.\n\nThe president\u2019s move came after a bench of three judges of the High Court gave Uhuru two weeks to swear in the judges, failure to which they will assume the positions after being sworn in by Chief Justice Martha Koome.\n\nThe six judges left out when Uhuru appointed 34 others are High Court judges Aggrey Muchelule, George Odunga, Weldon Korir and Joel Ngugi. The four had been recommended by Judicial Service Commission to join the appellate court.\n\nUhuru also left out chief magistrate Evans Makori and High Court registrar Judith Omange, who were recommended to be judges of the Labour Court.\n\nUhuru\u2019s move to decline to swear them is said to have been based on intelligence briefs on matters relating to corruption.Those we talked to revealed, the rot in the Judiciary has gained grounds but rotates around a section of well connected traditional judges that have links with powerful lawyers.They have been on the bench for years.\n\nThe truth of the matter is, not all judges are corrupt but just a few rotten ones that are tainting its image.They have influence at JSC and are untouchables.JSC is as per now a touthless dog which cannot bite as Judges run to courts to block discplinary actions.The said Judges petitions suprisinlgy land in hands for friendly faces.\n\nKinoti\u2019s other troubles was when he arrested justices Juma Chitembwe and Aggrey Muchelule over a Sh6.3 million bribe and abuse of office.\n\nThe two swiftly moved to High Court and Justice James Makau gave orders on July 23 2021 stopping their prosecution. The orders are to remain in force up to February 21 2022 when a case filed by the Kenya Judges and Magistrates Association will be mentioned for directions on hearing.\n\nKJMA secretary-general is Derrick Kuto with LSK president Nelson Havi.\n\nThe detectives alleged that they had information the judges had received bribes from some brokers with the intention of obtaining favourable judgments, and that the money was stored in their chambers.\n\nDuring the raid, police found $50,000 in the chamber of Justice Muchelule and $7,000 was recovered from Justice Chitembwe.\n\nDCI received intelligence on July 21 at 3pm that after a series of meetings between certain judges and the brokers a Sh7 million bribe had been agreed upon and it was to be delivered to the residence of a judge at 7pm.\n\nThe DCI further claims that $50,000 was seized from a woman who was in Justice Muchelule\u2019s Chamber 230 during the search, and $7,000 was seized from Justice Chitembwe who is alleged to have facilitated the meeting.\n\nJustice Muchelule was on his way to deliver pending judgments, while Justice Chitembwe was attending to a law student when detectives stormed their offices that are just a wall apart and arrested them.\n\nJudge Chitembwe however admits that he was found with $7,000 in his pocket which he says was meant for payment of school fees of his son who is studying at Edith Cowan University, Perth Australia. Questions are being asked why the judge did not transfer the said money to the son\u2019s account but decided to walk around with it in his office.\n\nChitembwe family operates a foreign currency account under his wife\u2019s name.\n\nDetectives searched both offices before taking them to the DCI headquarters for questioning.\n\nThere is talk among lawyers that some of their colleagues cannot win any case in court without bribing. The said lawyers are now at the forefront of defending judges implicated in corruption.\n\nKinoti was dealt a blow after the High Court declined to set aside the four-month prison sentence imposed on him for disobeying a court order requiring him to surrender firearms belonging to controversial businessman Jimi Wanjigi.\n\nJustice Antony Mrima ruled the orders he made on November 18 for Kinoti to present himself to prison should be complied with.\n\nKinoti had through lawyer Cecil Miller asked the court to set aside the sentence on grounds that he was wrongly enjoined in the case as he was not in possession of the firearms in question.\n\nAn attempt by Attorney General Kihara Kariuki to quash the imprisonment also failed.\n\nAlso on Kinoti\u2019s radar is Court of Appeal judge Sankale ole Kantai who is accused of participating in the planning and cover up of the murder of Dutch national Tob Cohen.\n\nThe judge is said to have had sexual escapades with Cohen\u2019s wife, Sarah Wairimu, who is the main suspect in the murder.\n\nInsiders revealed that the judges have teamed up with prominent lawyers to ensure Kinoti is jailed for arresting their colleagues.\n\nFor Mwilu, she is bitter with Kinoti for leading her arrest at the Supreme Court where she was then taken to DCI headquarters for questioning over graft.\n\nAfter the arrest, Mwilu was escorted by Kinoti to the DCI headquarters.\n\nMwilu was accused of obtaining execution of a security belonging to Imperial Bank Limited by false pretense and unlawfully failing to pay taxes.\n\nMwilu closed irregular property deals worth Sh315 million with the collapsed Imperial Bank.\n\nJustice Mwilu secured all these multimillion loan dealings just three months before Imperial Bank was put on receivership.\n\nImperial Bank was placed under receivership in October 2015, after its board alerted Capital Markets Authorities of suspected malpractices.\n\nShe acquired properties through backdoor deals that have now been linked to tax evasion by DPP\u2019s prosecution team.\n\nMwilu sold the three parcels of land for Sh315 million in suspicious deals made between March 2016 and July 2016.\n\nShe also failed to pay stamp duty of 4pc on value of the land she had bought via Imperial Bank between December 2014 and March 2016 for Sh160 million.\n\nJustice Mwilu\u2019s Sh132 million loans were granted interest free without written applications.\n\nJustice Mwilu did not appraise her creditworthiness for interest free loans that were granted using letters with Judiciary letters head.\n\nJustice Mwilu also fraudulently recovered securities of the said loans and sold them at a profit that directly led to losses of Sh60 million at the collapsed Imperial Bank.\n\nThis has been proven without doubt that Mwilu used her position at the Judicial office to improperly enrich herself.\n\nJustice Mwilu bought two plots in Nairobi for Sh80 million in December 2014; plot ref number 3734/202 and plot ref number 3734/209. It has also been revealed that Justice Mwilu took another short-term loan of Sh60 million for purchase of half-acre property registered under 3734/1129.\n\nThis is coming at a time when three appellate judges had just overturned a decision of the High Court barring the CMA from investigating circumstances under which Imperial Bank proceeded with a bond despite insider knowledge it was at the collapsing edge.\n\nTo complicate matters, Mwilu\u2019s case was to land before a three-judge bench of the Constitutional Court. The court has been asked to dismiss a case by Mwilu because she is trying to defeat justice by not appearing before the Judicial Service Commission.\n\nJustice Mwilu had filed a case before the court to stop the JSC from hearing four disciplinary cases against her. The case is being heard by Chitembwe, Roselyne Aburili and Weldon Korir.\n\nLawyers Lynn Nyangweso and Charles Kanjama argue the DCJ failed to exhaust all the available mechanisms of dispute resolution before approaching the court.\n\nAccording to the two lawyers, Justice Mwilu ought to have let the proceedings before the JSC be completed before she could approach the court for remedy.\n\nJustice Mwilu\u2019s application before the JSC for recusal of commissioners Kihara Kariuki and Macharia Njeru was heard and dismissed.\n\nTwo JSC commissioners are said to have found after weighing evidence that the application for their recusal lacked merit and declined to step aside from hearing disciplinary proceedings against Justice Mwilu.\n\nThe two also questioned why Justice Mwilu took a year and one month to challenge proceedings before the JSC even when she knew there was a time limit of six months within which such action ought to be taken.\n\nThe JSC had been temporarily stopped from conducting disciplinary proceedings against Mwilu, who is one of its members.\n\nBut she rushed to the High Court which declared she would not be prosecuted as the evidence by the DCI was illegally obtained.\n\nThe five-judge bench quashed the criminal case on that ground.\n\nThe bench said the DCI violated Mwilu\u2019s right to privacy by the manner in which it obtained its evidence by accessing her IBL accounts.\n\nMwilu was represented by Havi while Justices William Musyoki, Mumbi Ngugi, Hellen Omondi, Francis Tuiyott and Chacha Mwita made the ruling.\n\nAt the moment, the Director of Public Prosecutions Noordin Haji is fighting orders barring disciplinary proceedings against Mwilu.\n\nHaji is challenging the order issued by High Court judge Weldon Korir on August 17 after a successful application by Mwilu that stopped the Judicial Service Commission from instituting disciplinary proceedings against her.\n\nBack to Justice Kantai case, he was linked to Cohen\u2019s murder by a senior detective attached to DCI identified as John Gachomo.\n\nGachomo stated the judge held several secret meetings with Sarah Wairimu, who was the wife to the late Cohen.\n\nThey met in various places, dates and locations where they planned the murder of Cohen whose body was found inside his compound in Kitusuru Estate.\n\nGachomo, who is a senior assistant Inspector General of Police based at the DCI headquarters, claimed Judge Kantai fully participated in the murder.\n\nIn court documents, the DCI also blamed the office of the Director of Public Prosecution for trying to terminate the investigation with the aim of not charging the judge.\n\nIn a move aimed at proving why DCI believed that Kantai was part of the scheme, Gachomo said the judge fraudulently transferred shares of a company that was being run by Cohen from Silas Itas before eventually transferring them to Wairimu.\n\nHe said Cohen could later be killed two days after the fraudulent transfer was discovered.\n\n\u201cCohen was murdered barely two days after the discovery of the fraudulent transfer involving the petitioner and Wairimu. The discovery of the fraud is the motive of Cohen\u2019s death,\u201d the documents filed in court read in part.\n\nGachomo also said the DCI had established that the judge heightened his communication with Wairimu who is the main suspect in the murder of Cohen.\n\nIn his argument, Kantai had filed a petition saying he was in good terms with Cohen who was his client and close confidant to an extent of entrusting him with his investment.\n\nHowever, DCI believes at no point did Cohen agree that Kantai should have shares of his company.\n\nDetectives also believe that Wairimu was the judge\u2019s mistress, a relationship they had even before Cohen passed on.\n\nCohen was murdered on either July 19 2020 and his body hidden in a septic tank within his compound until it was discovered by detectives.\n\nInsiders added that the cartel has made justice for sale to the highest bidder.\n\nTo execute the scheme, the prominent lawyers engage in what is called Forum Shopping, a colloquial term for the practice of litigants having their legal cases heard by a friendly judge who will most likely rule in favour of their clients.\n\nInsiders revealed that the game plan is to hide material facts in courts to either secure conviction or freedom of the suspects represented by the said lawyers.\n\nFor instance in the Kinoti case, Wanjigi in his petition failed to disclose to the court that the Firearm Licensing Board is the body that keeps custody of guns for civilians and that once such guns are seized, they can only be got from them and not DCI headquarters.\n\nAlready, the ministry of Interior and Coordination of National Government has written to Wanjigi requiring him to present himself to the FLB to get his firearms back.\n\nThe ministry acknowledged receipt of a court order Wanjigi attached in his letter demanding to be given the dangerous firearms.\n\nBut it noted that the board is an independent body mandated by constitution to deal with licensing of firearms to the civilian.\n\nThe ministry noted that it is the mandate of the board to issue firearms to civilians, noting that the matter was litigated in court in the absence of the board which could have helped the court to arrive at a reasonable determination.\n\nIt noted that the National Police Service does not store firearms or keep and or deal with civilian firearms as alleged in the Petition 520 of 2017 filed by Wanjigi.\n\n\u201cWe find this mischievous, from now henceforth kindly consider dealing with the board directly,\u201d the letter signed by Daniel Seme, states.\n\nIt is also emerging that Wanjigi attempted to bribe a Jubilee activist Mike Makarina with Sh5 million to trap Kinoti and subsequently have him jailed.\n\nThe activist, who is also chairman of Person Living with Disabilities in Meru county, is on record claiming he was promised Sh5 million to hide documents in order to put Kinoti behind bars.\n\nThe developments come amidst a petition filed at the Judicial Review Division seeking to compel Kinoti to arrest Wanjigi for being in possession of illegal firearms and ammunition.\n\nAccording to documents filed in court, Memba Ocharo argues Wanjigi\u2019s conduct has previously been questionable hence he should not be allowed to possess the firearms.\n\nThrough lawyer Danstan Omari, Ocharo says Wanjigi is a former Inspector of Police and was stripped of all his police powers and ordered to surrender all his firearms and ammunition in his custody following numerous incidents and complaints about his misuse of firearms.\n\nThe petitioner claims long after Wanjigi was dismissed from employment with the Police Service for misuse of firearms in threatening and intimidating members of the public, he has nonetheless been a licensed firearms holder until January 30, 2018, when the firearm licensing board revoked his firearms\u2019 certificate.The question is,will Koome manage the pressure from the gang and survive.Remember Ahmed Nasir and Maraga bitter court wars.", "articleBodyHtml": "<article>\n\n<p>Ali Nur<br>\nThe jailing of Directorate of Criminal Investigations boss George Kinoti is seen from

The said lawyers are now at the forefront of defending judges implicated in corruption.</p>\n\n<p>Kinoti was dealt a blow after the High Court declined to set aside the four-month prison sentence imposed on him for disobeying a court order requiring him to surrender firearms belonging to controversial businessman Jimi Wanjigi.</p>\n\n<p>Justice Antony Mrima ruled the orders he made on November 18 for Kinoti to present himself to prison should be complied with.</p>\n\n<p>Kinoti had through lawyer Cecil Miller asked the court to set aside the sentence on grounds that he was wrongly enjoined in the case as he was not in possession of the firearms in question.</p>\n\n<p>An attempt by Attorney General Kihara Kariuki to quash the imprisonment also failed.</p>\n\n<p>Also on Kinoti\u2019s radar is Court of Appeal judge Sankale ole Kantai who is accused of participating in the planning and cover up of the murder of Dutch national Tob Cohen.</p>\n\n<p>The judge is said to have had sexual escapades with Cohen\u2019s wife, Sarah Wairimu, who is the main suspect in the murder.</p>\n\n<p>Insiders revealed that the judges have teamed up with prominent lawyers to ensure Kinoti is jailed for arresting their colleagues.</p>\n\n<p>For Mwilu, she is bitter with Kinoti for leading her arrest at the Supreme Court where she was then taken to DCI headquarters for questioning over graft.</p>\n\n<p>After the arrest, Mwilu was escorted by Kinoti to the DCI headquarters.</p>\n\n<p>Mwilu was accused of obtaining execution of a security belonging to Imperial Bank Limited by false pretense and unlawfully failing to pay taxes.</p>\n\n<p>Mwilu closed irregular property deals worth Sh315 million with the collapsed Imperial Bank.</p>\n\n<p>Justice Mwilu secured all these multimillion loan dealings just three months before Imperial Bank was put on receivership.</p>\n\n<p>Imperial Bank was placed under receivership in October 2015, after its board alerted Capital Markets Authorities of suspected malpractices.</p>\n\n<p>She acquired properties through backdoor deals that have now been linked to tax evasion by DPP\u2019s prosecution team.</p>\n\n<p>Mwilu sold the three parcels of land for Sh315 million in suspicious deals made between March 2016 and July 2016.</p>\n\n<p>She also failed to pay stamp duty of 4pc on value of the land she had bought via Imperial Bank between December 2014 and March 2016 for Sh160 million.</p>\n\n<p>Justice Mwilu\u2019s Sh132 million loans were granted interest free without written applications.</p>\n\n<p>Justice Mwilu did not appraise her creditworthiness for interest free loans that were granted using letters with Judiciary letters head.</p>\n\n<p>Justice Mwilu also fraudulently recovered securities of the said loans and sold them at a profit that directly led to losses of Sh60 million at the collapsed Imperial Bank.</p>\n\n<p>This has been proven without doubt that Mwilu used her position at the Judicial office to improperly enrich herself.</p>\n\n<p>Justice Mwilu bought two plots in Nairobi for Sh80 million in December 2014; plot ref number 3734/202 and plot ref number 3734/209. It has also been revealed that Justice Mwilu took another short-term loan of Sh60 million for purchase of half-acre property registered under 3734/1129.</p>\n\n<p>This is coming at a time when three appellate judges had just overturned a decision of the High Court barring the CMA from investigating circumstances under which Imperial Bank proceeded with a bond despite insider knowledge it was at the collapsing edge.</p>\n\n<p>To complicate matters, Mwilu\u2019s  case was to land before a three-judge bench of the Constitutional Court. The court has been asked to dismiss a case by Mwilu because she is trying to defeat justice by not appearing before the Judicial Service Commission.</p>\n\n<p>Justice Mwilu had filed a case before the court to stop the JSC from hearing four disciplinary cases against her. The case is being heard by Chitembwe, Roselyne Aburili and Weldon Korir.</p>\n\n<p>Lawyers Lynn Nyangweso and Charles Kanjama argue the DCJ failed to exhaust all the available mechanisms of dispute resolution before approaching the court.</p>\n\n<p>According to the two lawyers, Justice Mwilu ought to have let the proceedings before the JSC be completed before she could approach the court for remedy.</p>\n\n<p>Justice Mwilu\u2019s application before the JSC for recusal of commissioners Kihara Kariuki and Macharia Njeru was heard and dismissed.</p>\n\n<p>Two JSC commissioners are said to have found after weighing evidence that the application for their recusal lacked merit and declined to step aside from hearing disciplinary proceedings against Justice Mwilu.</p>\n\n<p>The  two also questioned why Justice Mwilu took a year and one month to challenge proceedings before the JSC even when she knew there was a time limit of six months within which such action ought to be taken.</p>\n\n<p>The JSC had been temporarily stopped from conducting disciplinary proceedings against Mwilu, who is one of its members.</p>\n\n<p>But she rushed to the High Court which declared she would not be prosecuted as the evidence by the DCI was illegally obtained.</p>\n\n<p>The five-judge bench quashed the criminal case on that ground.</p>\n\n<p>The bench said the DCI violated Mwilu\u2019s right to privacy by the manner in which it obtained its evidence by accessing her IBL accounts.</p>\n\n<p>Mwilu was represented by Havi while Justices William Musyoki, Mumbi Ngugi, Hellen Omondi, Francis Tuiyott and Chacha Mwita made the ruling.</p>\n\n<p>At the moment, the Director of Public Prosecutions Noordin Haji is fighting orders barring disciplinary proceedings against Mwilu.</p>\n\n<p>Haji is challenging the order issued by High Court judge Weldon Korir on August 17 after a successful application by Mwilu that stopped the Judicial Service Commission from instituting disciplinary proceedings against her.</p>\n\n<p>Back to Justice Kantai case, he was linked to Cohen\u2019s murder by a senior detective attached to DCI identified as John Gachomo.</p>\n\n<p>Gachomo stated the judge held several secret meetings with Sarah Wairimu, who was the wife to the late Cohen.</p>\n\n<p>They met in various places, dates and locations where they planned the murder of Cohen whose body was found inside his compound in Kitusuru Estate.</p>\n\n<p>Gachomo, who is a senior assistant Inspector General of Police based at the DCI headquarters, claimed Judge Kantai fully participated in the murder.</p>\n\n<p>In court documents, the DCI also blamed the office of the Director of Public Prosecution for trying to terminate the investigation with the aim of not charging the judge.</p>\n\n<p>In a move aimed at proving why DCI believed that Kantai was part of the scheme, Gachomo said the judge fraudulently transferred shares of a company that was being run by Cohen from Silas Itas before eventually transferring them to Wairimu.</p>\n\n<p>He said Cohen could later be killed two days after the fraudulent transfer was discovered.</p>\n\n<p>\u201cCohen was murdered barely two days after the discovery of the fraudulent transfer involving the petitioner and Wairimu. The discovery of the fraud is the motive of Cohen\u2019s death,\u201d the documents filed in court read in part.</p>\n\n<p>Gachomo also said the DCI had established that the judge heightened his communication with Wairimu who is the main suspect in the murder of Cohen.</p>\n\n<p>In his argument, Kantai had filed a petition saying he was in good terms with Cohen who was his client and close confidant to an extent of entrusting him with his investment.</p>\n\n<p>However, DCI believes at no point did Cohen agree that Kantai should have shares of his company.</p>\n\n<p>Detectives also believe that Wairimu was the judge\u2019s mistress, a relationship they had even before Cohen passed on.</p>\n\n<p>Cohen was murdered on either July 19 2020 and his body hidden in a septic tank within his compound until it was discovered by detectives.</p>\n\n<p>Insiders added that the cartel has made justice for sale to the highest bidder.</p>\n\n<p>To execute the scheme, the prominent lawyers engage in what is called Forum Shopping, a colloquial term for the practice of litigants having their legal cases heard by a friendly judge who will most likely rule in favour of their clients.</p>\n\n<p>Insiders revealed that the game plan is to hide material facts in courts to either secure conviction or freedom of the suspects represented by the said lawyers.</p>\n\n<p>For instance in the Kinoti case, Wanjigi in his petition failed to disclose to the court that the Firearm Licensing Board is the body that keeps custody of guns for civilians and that once such guns are seized, they can only be got from them and not DCI headquarters.</p>\n\n<p>Already, the ministry of Interior and Coordination of National Government has written to Wanjigi requiring him to present himself to the FLB to get his firearms back.</p>\n\n<p>The ministry acknowledged receipt of a court order Wanjigi attached in his letter demanding to be given the dangerous firearms.</p>\n\n<p>But it noted that the board is an independent body mandated by constitution to deal with licensing of firearms to the civilian.</p>\n\n<p>The ministry noted that it is the mandate of the board to issue firearms to civilians, noting that the matter was litigated in court in the absence of the board which could have helped the court to arrive at a reasonable determination.</p>\n\n<p>It noted that the National Police Service does not store firearms or keep and or deal with civilian firearms as alleged in the Petition 520 of 2017 filed by Wanjigi.</p>\n\n<p>\u201cWe find this mischievous, from now henceforth kindly consider dealing with the board directly,\u201d the letter signed by Daniel Seme, states.</p>\n\n<p>It is also emerging that Wanjigi attempted to bribe a Jubilee activist Mike Makarina with Sh5 million to trap Kinoti and subsequently have him jailed.</p>\n\n<p>The activist, who is also chairman of Person Living with Disabilities in Meru county, is on record claiming he was promised Sh5 million to hide documents in order to put Kinoti behind bars.</p>\n\n<p>The developments come amidst a petition filed at the Judicial Review Division seeking to compel Kinoti to arrest Wanjigi for being in possession of illegal firearms and ammunition.</p>\n\n<p>According to documents filed in court, Memba Ocharo argues Wanjigi\u2019s conduct has previously been questionable hence he should not be allowed to possess the firearms.<br></p>\n\n<figure><img src=\"https://weeklycitizen.co.ke/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/jimmy.jpg\" alt=\"\"><figcaption><p>Jimmy Wanjigi</p></figcaption></figure>\n\n<p>Through lawyer Danstan Omari, Ocharo says Wanjigi is a former Inspector of Police and was stripped of all his police powers and ordered to surrender all his firearms and ammunition in his custody following numerous incidents and complaints about his misuse of firearms.</p>\n\n<p>The petitioner claims long after Wanjigi was dismissed from employment with the Police Service for misuse of firearms in threatening and intimidating members of the public, he has nonetheless been a licensed firearms holder until January 30, 2018, when the firearm licensing board revoked his firearms\u2019 certificate.The question is,will Koome manage the pressure from the gang  and survive.Remember Ahmed Nasir and Maraga bitter court wars.</p>\n\n</article>",
