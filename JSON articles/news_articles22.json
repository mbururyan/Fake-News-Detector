The partnership with the UN is vital to the discharge of the university\u2019s mandate as a teaching, research and community outreach higher education institution.\n\nAdditionally, Prof Struthers said MKU also partnered with the Kilimanjaro Blind Trust Africa to provide 20 Orbit Reader electronic devices to replace Braille devices. Also established is the Yunus Social Business Centre at its main campus in Thika in honour of the world famous social entrepreneur, Prof Mohammed Yunus.\n\nLast month, the centre hosted the 10th YUNUS Social Business Academic Conference, as well as the 10th YUNUS Global Social Business Summit at MKU. Other conferences successfully hosted at the university within the last three months include the Talloires Network Conference, and the First Entrepreneurial University of Africa Conference.\n\nMKU also participated in the Inter-Universities Consortium\u2019s 7th International Interdisciplinary Conference. The latter event was co-hosted by the consortium of the four-member universities at Kyambogo University, Uganda.\n\nMKU chairman Prof Simon Gicharu said the gap between what was experienced after the outbreak of the pandemic and where the institution is today has been closed up by ICT connectivity. \u201cWe all have seen the power of ICT revolution and its usefulness in mitigating against COVID-19 pandemic challenges at the institutional level,\u201d he said, and promised that his Board will continue to invest more on ICT to ensure improved connectivity for students and staff.\n\nGicharu said MKU is working towards establishing a stand-alone medical facility for use by the students of the College of Health Sciences. \u201cThis block will have an inbuilt hostel facilities for medical students, classrooms and laboratories including an Anatomy Laboratory to supplement the Thika Level 5 Hospital facility,\u201d he said.\n\nMKU management has also approved a Ksh1 billion budget to develop an Ultra-Modern hostel facility for MKU students to be located within a walking distance from the university. And following the advice of Cabinet Secretary of Internal Security during his recent visit to MKU, a security committee that includes representatives of the local community has been formed to boost the areas\u2019 security services.\n\nGicharu promised continued support to the East African Regional Integration and urged the institution\u2019s Vice Chancellor, Prof. Deogratius Jaganyi and the Rwanda campus Vice-Chancellor Designate Prof Edwin Odhuno to come up with research based community engagement project proposals at a regional level to be funded by the college as a way of additional contribution to regional integration.\n\nProf David Serem, the MKU University Council chairman, says the university has released a series of policies and guidelines which improve service delivery and enhance the university\u2019s corporate image. One of the most recently released policies focuses on improving the safe use of laboratories in the university. Prof Serem said various independent surveys have consistently ranked MKU among the top universities in Kenya for several years.\n\n\u201cThe July 2021 edition of the Webometrics ranking of world universities placed MKU among the top five private universities in Kenya. And on Google\u2019s list of the most searched institutions in Kenya in the last 15 years, MKU ranks sixth,\u201d he added.\n\nProf Serem asserted that the University Council will continue supporting the institution to enhance stakeholder satisfaction. \u201cThis will create an awesome customer experience and lead to the university attracting and retaining students and employees,\u2019 he said.\n\nAmong the corporate social responsibility programmes at the institution, is support for bright and needy students by the MKU Foundation. \u201cThe foundation supports these students through its annual Ksh 5 million Vice-Chancellor\u2019s scholarships and the Chancellor\u2019s Ksh 1.5 million scholarships,\u201d he said.\n\nAccording to the university\u2019s Vice-Chancellor, Prof Deogratius Jaganyi, commitment to quality is why MKU continues to attract huge numbers of both government and self-sponsored students. MKU is the first private university to be accredited by the Kenya National Qualifications Authority (KNQA). KNQA awarded MKU a certificate of accreditation and recognition as a Qualification Awarding Institution (QAI) for 198 academic programmes.\n\nThe university innovated Nutri-Kid, a low-cost, Ready-to-Use-Therapeutic-Food (RUTF) for the management of malnutrition in children. Yet another recent innovation is Lipa Fees, a fintech solution developed by a student to enable financial inclusion and access to education.\n\nMKU recently received a Ksh7 million grant from International Research and Development (IRD) to train and implement Covid-19 guidelines in Kiambu and Nairobi counties. In partnership with the International Agency for Research on Cancer (a WHO agency), MKU researchers are studying the genetics of breast cancer in Kenya and other low and middle income countries.\n\nThe university also collaborated with KNATCOM-UNESCO and National Research Fund, it donated Ksh 7 million preloaded tablets with education materials, to inmates.\n\nMKU and Partners for Care donated 2,000 three-ply masks, 1,000 recyclable water bag-packs and water-guard, to Laikipia County Primary School pupils. In yet another institution initiative, the MKU School of Law launched a six-month Murang\u2019a County land succession empowerment programme to provide free legal clinics to resolve land disputes and benefit more than 2,000 members.\n\nAdditionally, MKU has partnered with UNESCO and the University of Nairobi, to promote student health and well-being through the 03 Plus Project.\n\nMeanwhile, this year marks MKU\u2019s 12 years of existence in the Republic of Rwanda. From humble facilities that the campus rented in Camp Kigali, City Centre and Kicukiro, the college now occupies a massive state-of-the-art edifice on 11,000 square metres.\n\n\u201cIn addition to this complex, and the affiliated Royal FM facilities, the campus is constructing a model training hotel, Mount Kigali Utalii Hotel for Hospitality and Travel related specialisations,\u201d Prof Edwin Odhuno, vice-chancellor designate, MKU Rwanda.\n\nOn Friday, MKU Rwanda graduated 450 students from the Kigali campus, celebrating its growing international student graduates in the last few years. \u201cThese graduates come from the Democratic Republic of Congo (DRC), Burundi, Uganda, Nigeria, Liberia, Chad, Gambia and Tanzania, among others,\u201d added Prof Odhuno.", "articleBodyHtml": "<article>\n\n<p><strong>The government has told universities they are likely to be caught unawares and unprepared by the implementation of the Competency-Based Curriculum (CBC) system.</strong></p>\n\n<p>Amb.

The latter event was co-hosted by the consortium of the four-member universities at Kyambogo University, Uganda.</p>\n\n<p>MKU chairman Prof Simon Gicharu said the gap between what was experienced after the outbreak of the pandemic and where the institution is today has been closed up by ICT connectivity. \u201cWe all have seen the power of ICT revolution and its usefulness in mitigating against COVID-19 pandemic challenges at the institutional level,\u201d he said, and promised that his Board will continue to invest more on ICT to ensure improved connectivity for students and staff.</p>\n\n<p>Gicharu said\u00a0MKU is working towards establishing a stand-alone medical facility for use by the students of the College of Health Sciences. \u201cThis block will have an inbuilt hostel facilities for medical students, classrooms and laboratories including an Anatomy Laboratory to supplement the Thika Level 5 Hospital facility,\u201d he said.</p>\n\n<p>MKU management has also approved a Ksh1 billion budget to develop an Ultra-Modern hostel facility for MKU students to be located within a walking distance from the university. And following the advice of Cabinet Secretary of Internal Security during his recent visit to MKU, a security committee that includes representatives of the local community has been formed to boost the areas\u2019 security services.</p>\n\n<p>Gicharu promised continued support to the East African Regional Integration and urged the institution\u2019s Vice Chancellor,\u00a0Prof. Deogratius Jaganyi and the Rwanda campus Vice-Chancellor Designate Prof Edwin Odhuno to come up with research based community engagement project proposals at a regional level to be funded by the college as a way of additional contribution to regional integration.</p>\n\n<p>Prof David Serem, the MKU University Council chairman, says the university has released a series of policies and guidelines which improve service delivery and enhance the university\u2019s corporate image. One of the most recently released policies focuses on improving the safe use of laboratories in the university. Prof Serem said various independent surveys have consistently ranked MKU among the top universities in Kenya for several years.</p>\n\n<p>\u201cThe July 2021 edition of the Webometrics ranking of world universities placed MKU among the top five private universities in Kenya. And on Google\u2019s list of the most searched institutions in Kenya in the last 15 years, MKU ranks sixth,\u201d he added.</p>\n\n<p>Prof Serem asserted that the University Council will continue supporting the institution to enhance stakeholder satisfaction. \u201cThis will create an awesome customer experience and lead to the university attracting and retaining students and employees,\u2019 he said.</p>\n\n<p>Among the corporate social responsibility programmes at the institution, \u00a0\u00a0is support for bright and needy students by the MKU Foundation.\u00a0 \u201cThe foundation supports these students through its annual Ksh 5 million Vice-Chancellor\u2019s scholarships and the Chancellor\u2019s Ksh 1.5 million scholarships,\u201d he said.</p>\n\n<p>According to the university\u2019s Vice-Chancellor, Prof Deogratius Jaganyi, commitment to quality is why MKU continues to attract huge numbers of both government and self-sponsored students. MKU is the first private university to be accredited by the Kenya National Qualifications Authority (KNQA). KNQA awarded MKU a certificate of accreditation and recognition as a Qualification Awarding Institution (QAI) for 198 academic programmes.</p>\n\n<p>The university innovated Nutri-Kid, a low-cost, Ready-to-Use-Therapeutic-Food (RUTF) for the management of malnutrition in children. Yet another recent innovation is Lipa Fees, a fintech solution developed by a student to enable financial inclusion and access to education.</p>\n\n<p>MKU recently received a Ksh7 million grant from International Research and Development (IRD) to train and implement Covid-19 guidelines in Kiambu and Nairobi counties. In partnership with the International Agency for Research on Cancer (a WHO agency), MKU researchers are studying the genetics of breast cancer in Kenya and other low and middle income countries.</p>\n\n<p>The university also collaborated with KNATCOM-UNESCO and National Research Fund, it donated Ksh 7 million preloaded tablets with education materials, to inmates.</p>\n\n<p>MKU and Partners for Care donated 2,000 three-ply masks, 1,000 recyclable water bag-packs and water-guard, to Laikipia County Primary School pupils. In yet another institution initiative, the MKU School of Law launched a six-month Murang\u2019a County land succession empowerment programme to provide free legal clinics to resolve land disputes and benefit more than 2,000 members.</p>\n\n<p>Additionally, MKU has partnered with UNESCO and the University of Nairobi, to promote student health and well-being through the 03 Plus Project.</p>\n\n<p>Meanwhile, this\u00a0year\u00a0marks\u00a0MKU\u2019s 12 years of existence in\u00a0the Republic of Rwanda. From humble facilities that the campus rented in Camp Kigali, City Centre and Kicukiro, the college now occupies a massive state-of-the-art edifice on 11,000 square metres.</p>\n\n<p>\u201cIn addition to this complex, and the affiliated Royal FM facilities, the campus is constructing a model training hotel, Mount Kigali Utalii Hotel for Hospitality and Travel related specialisations,\u201d Prof Edwin Odhuno, vice-chancellor designate, MKU Rwanda.</p>\n\n<p>On Friday, MKU Rwanda graduated 450 students from the Kigali campus, celebrating its growing international student graduates in the last few years. \u201cThese graduates come from the Democratic Republic of Congo (DRC), Burundi, Uganda, Nigeria, Liberia, Chad, Gambia and Tanzania, among others,\u201d added Prof Odhuno.</p>\n\n</article>", "canonicalUrl": "https://www.kbc.co.ke/state-warns-varsities-time-is-running-out-for-cbc-curriculum-preparation/"},{"url": "https://www.kbc.co.ke/ruto-raila/", "probability": 0.9821539, "headline": "Ruto allies warn Raila of betrayal", "datePublished": "2021-12-11T00:00:00", "datePublishedRaw": "2021-12-11", "dateModified": "2021-12-11T00:00:00", "dateModifiedRaw": "2021-12-11", "author": "Christine Muchira", "authorsList": ["Christine Muchira"], "inLanguage": "en", "mainImage": "https://www.kbc.co.ke/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/raila-1.jpg", "images": ["https://i1.wp.com/www.kbc.co.ke/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/raila-1.jpg?fit=901%2C500&ssl=1"], "description": "A section of leaders\u00a0allied to Deputy President William Ruto\u00a0have cautioned Orange Democratic movement leader Raila Odinga to be wary of those pushing for his presidency.\u00a0", "articleBody": "They said the opposition leader Raila Odinga could be betrayed.\n\nThe leaders noted the genesis of the scheme was witnessed in Kasarani on Friday when key political figures in the country skipped the Azimio La Umoja Convention.\n\nThose who spoke about the likelihood of betrayal were Governors Josphat Nanok (Turkana), Stanley Kiptis (Baringo), Jackson Mandago (Uasin Gishu), MPs Daniel Epuyo Nanok (Turkana West), Malachy Ekal Imana (Turkana), Joyce Emanikor (Turkana) and Christopher Nakuleu (Turkana North).\n\nOthers were James Lomenen (Turkana South), Mohammed Ali Lokiru (Turkana East), Aden Duale (Garissa Town), Kimani Ichung\u2019wah (Kikuyu) and other leaders from Uganda, South Sudan and Ethiopia.\n\nFrom the incident, the leaders said, it was clear Odinga had been plunged into the \u201cpolitics of back-stabbing, deceit and betrayal\u201d.\n\nThey spoke in Lodwar, Turkana County, during the celebration of the sixth edition of the Tobong\u2019u Lore.\n\n\u201cThose that have been pushing your agenda are isolating you.

The total number of Covid cases recorded on Friday was 58,194 \u2013 the highest figure since 9 January.\n\nThe government has said it is updating its guidance for care homes in England \u2013 limiting the number of visitors allowed per resident, and increasing testing \u201cin order to balance the current Covid-19 risk\u201d.\n\nOne of the main concerns since the heavily-mutated Omicron variant first emerged was that it would make vaccines less effective.\n\nThe UK Health Security Agency report analysed data from 581 Omicron cases and thousands of Delta cases to calculate how effective the vaccines were against the new variant.\n\nThe analysis is based on limited data, but showed a dramatic drop in effectiveness for the Oxford-AstraZeneca vaccine and a significant drop off for two doses of Pfizer.\n\nThe 75% protection against Covid symptoms after a booster is not as high as against previous variants.\n\nThere was not enough data to analyse the Moderna or Janssen vaccines, but there is no reason to think they would have different results.\n\nHowever, the UK Health Security Agency said vaccines were still likely to offer good protection against severe Covid that needed hospital treatment.\n\nSo far, around 22 million people have received a booster dose, but even if everyone was boosted the lower vaccine effectiveness would still leave millions of people susceptible.\n\nThe real-world data backs up laboratory studies that showed a 40-fold reduction in the ability of antibodies from double-vaccinated people to take out the virus.\n\nThere is optimism that vaccines will still keep many people out of hospital even if more do get Covid.

The total number of Covid cases recorded on Friday was 58,194 \u2013 the highest figure since 9 January.</p>\n\n<p>The government has said it is updating its guidance for care homes in England \u2013 limiting the number of visitors allowed per resident, and increasing testing \u201cin order to balance the current Covid-19 risk\u201d.</p>\n\n<p>One of the main concerns since the heavily-mutated Omicron variant first emerged was that it would make vaccines less effective.</p>\n\n<p>The UK Health Security Agency report analysed data from 581 Omicron cases and thousands of Delta cases to calculate how effective the vaccines were against the new variant.</p>\n\n<p>The analysis is based on limited data, but showed a dramatic drop in effectiveness for the Oxford-AstraZeneca vaccine and a significant drop off for two doses of Pfizer.</p>\n\n<p>The 75% protection against Covid symptoms after a booster is not as high as against previous variants.</p>\n\n<p>There was not enough data to analyse the Moderna or Janssen vaccines, but there is no reason to think they would have different results.</p>\n\n<p>However, the UK Health Security Agency said vaccines were still likely to offer good protection against severe Covid that needed hospital treatment.</p>\n\n<p>So far, around 22 million people have received a booster dose, but even if everyone was boosted the lower vaccine effectiveness would still leave millions of people susceptible.</p>\n\n<p>The real-world data backs up laboratory studies that showed a <a href=\"https://www.ahri.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/MEDRXIV-2021-267417v1-Sigal.pdf\">40-fold reduction</a> in the ability of antibodies from double-vaccinated people to take out the virus.</p>\n\n<p>There is optimism that vaccines will still keep many people out of hospital even if more do get Covid.

Post-colonial administrations perfected it through the politics of tribalism and patronage.\n\nIt was therefore hoped that the new constitutional dispensation beginning 2010 would end this problem. However, devolution has in fact entrenched ethnic marginalization. This is mainly because communities that were previously marginalized at the national level became the majority in some counties, and by controlling political power and economic resources at the county level, have pushed the minority communities to the periphery.\n\nThis phenomenon is well captured in an insightful article titled \u2018The State of political inclusion of ethnic communities under Kenya\u2019s devolved system\u2019 by Ben Nyabira and Zemelah Ayele, where they assert that, \u201cpreviously excluded communities not only have become represented at county level, but have in fact gained control of one or more counties where they form the majority \u2026\u2026 (and) are excluding those who are in the minority in those counties.\u201d\n\nThis new dynamic is shaping local politics in fundamental ways including the emergence of a negotiated form of democracy in the counties, in which the various competing ethnic interests, mostly the dominant local political elite, decide how power and economic resources in the county will be allocated.\n\nThe new state of affairs has largely favored communities that were historically marginalized but now constitute the dominant ethnic population in some counties, like the Miji Kenda in Kwale, and Kilifi the Masai in Samburu, Narok and Kajiado, the Borana in Marsabit and Isiolo, and the Somali in Garissa, Mandera and Wajir, just as examples.\n\nIncidentally, larger communities dominating the national political landscape like the Kikuyu, Kamba, Luo, Kalenjin and Luhya, who form the bulk of migrants in such counties, have become minorities.\n\nWhereas the Constitution recognizes the \u201cethnic, cultural and religious diversity of the Kenyan people\u201d the reality is that ethnic relations in Kenya are characterized by mistrust and suspicion especially in the sharing of the national cake. It is not surprising that counties are now theatres of ethnic contestations around power and resources.\n\nThis is evident in the ethnic composition of elective positions at the devolved level. In some county assemblies, over 90 per cent of MCAs come from the so-called indigenous communities. Who is elected governor depends on local clan and factional politics aligned with ethnic interests.\n\nWhich is why in Kilifi where I come from, the chances of, say, a member of the Luo or Kamba communities becoming governor are remote. Not that it can\u2019t happen but that would require a tectonic shift in local politics. At best, such a candidate is likely to be fronted for the deputy governor position, for political optics or economic reasons.\n\nMarginalization in the counties is also prominently etched in the highly skewed ethnic appointments in the public service. A report published in 2016 by the National Cohesion and Integration Commission (NCIC) revealed that 32 out of the 47 counties had failed to meet the inclusivity test as measured by representation of diversity in the county public service.\n\nYet, Article 232 of the Constitution spells out the values and principles of public service like \u201caffording adequate and equal opportunities for appointment, training and advancement, at all levels of the public service (including) the members of all ethnic groups\u2026.\u201d\n\nSimilarly, Section 7(1) of the National Cohesion and Integration Act requires that all public institutions reflect the diversity of the people of Kenya in the employment of staff. Under Section 65 of the County Governments Act 2012, County Public Service Boards must ensure at least 30 per cent of the vacant posts are filled by candidates who are not from the dominant ethnic community in the county.\n\nBut only 15 counties had adhered to this criteria, according to the NCIC report. Since county governments are platforms through which communities access, participate and benefit from public service functions, the perception that they belong to certain communities reinforces the feeling of exclusion among those left out.\n\nDiverse representation of communities in governance organs also helps address underlying political, social, economic and religious grievances that if not resolved, put local communities at the risk of increased crime and insecurity.\n\nWith the 2022 electoral contest just around the corner, competition for power and control of resources in the counties will certainly intensify. As they say, politics is local.\n\nNegotiated democracy is not necessarily bad but should be embraced within the confines of our Constitution and laws and in a manner that does not erode the benefits of devolution or worse, undermine the long-term stability of the country at large.", "articleBodyHtml": "<article>\n\n<p><strong>Throughout the protracted struggle for political reforms culminating in the Constitution of Kenya 2010, the marginalization and exclusion of communities, groups and regions was a major grievance. </strong></p>\n\n<p>Kenyans from all walks of life voiced a desire for an inclusive governance structure anchored on equitable access to resources and participation of the people in decision-making.</p>\n\n<p>As one of the core pillars of the new Constitution, devolution was conceptualized as a vehicle for national inclusion including protecting the rights and interests of minorities and excluded groups.</p>\n\n<p>Article 260 of the Constitution of Kenya 2010 defines a marginalised group as a group of people, who are disadvantaged by discrimination, for example, on grounds of ethnic or social origin.</p>\n\n<p>Marginalization of communities in Kenya, whether large or small, has its roots in the colonial policy of divide-and-rule.

This is mainly because communities that were previously marginalized at the national level became the majority in some counties, and by controlling political power and economic resources at the county level, have pushed the minority communities to the periphery.</p>\n\n<p>This phenomenon is well captured in an insightful article titled\u00a0<em>\u2018The State of political inclusion of ethnic communities under Kenya\u2019s devolved system\u2019</em>\u00a0by Ben Nyabira and Zemelah Ayele, where they assert that, \u201cpreviously excluded communities not only have become represented at county level, but have in fact gained control of one or more counties where they form the majority \u2026\u2026 (and) are excluding those who are in the minority in those counties.\u201d</p>\n\n<p>This new dynamic is shaping local politics in fundamental ways including the emergence of a negotiated form of democracy in the counties, in which the various competing ethnic interests, mostly the dominant local political elite, decide how power and economic resources in the county will be allocated.</p>\n\n<p>The new state of affairs has largely favored communities that were historically marginalized but now constitute the dominant ethnic population in some counties, like the Miji Kenda in Kwale, and Kilifi the Masai in Samburu, Narok and Kajiado, the Borana in Marsabit and Isiolo, and the Somali in Garissa, Mandera and Wajir, just as examples.</p>\n\n<p>Incidentally, larger communities dominating the national political landscape like the Kikuyu, Kamba, Luo, Kalenjin and Luhya, who form the bulk of migrants in such counties, have become minorities.</p>\n\n<p>Whereas the Constitution recognizes the \u201cethnic, cultural and religious diversity of the Kenyan people\u201d the reality is that ethnic relations in Kenya are characterized by mistrust and suspicion especially in the sharing of the national cake. It is not surprising that counties are now theatres of ethnic contestations around power and resources.</p>\n\n<p>This is evident in the ethnic composition of elective positions at the devolved level. In some county assemblies, over 90 per cent of MCAs come from the so-called indigenous communities. Who is elected governor depends on local clan and factional politics aligned with ethnic interests.</p>\n\n<p>Which is why in Kilifi where I come from, the chances of, say, a member of the Luo or Kamba communities becoming governor are remote. Not that it can\u2019t happen but that would require a tectonic shift in local politics. At best, such a candidate is likely to be fronted for the deputy governor position, for political optics or economic reasons.</p>\n\n<p>Marginalization in the counties is also prominently etched in the highly skewed ethnic appointments in the public service. A report published in 2016 by the National Cohesion and Integration Commission (NCIC) revealed that 32 out of the 47 counties had failed to meet the inclusivity test as measured by representation of diversity in the county public service.</p>\n\n<p>Yet, Article 232 of the Constitution spells out the values and principles of public service like \u201caffording adequate and equal opportunities for appointment, training and advancement, at all levels of the public service (including) the members of all ethnic groups\u2026.\u201d</p>\n\n<p>Similarly, Section 7(1) of the National Cohesion and Integration Act requires that all public institutions reflect the diversity of the people of Kenya in the employment of staff. Under Section 65 of the County Governments Act 2012, County Public Service Boards must ensure at least 30 per cent of the vacant posts are filled by candidates who are not from the dominant ethnic community in the county.</p>\n\n<p>But only 15 counties had adhered to this criteria, according to the NCIC report. Since county governments are platforms through which communities access, participate and benefit from public service functions, the perception that they belong to certain communities reinforces the feeling of exclusion among those left out.</p>\n\n<p>Diverse representation of communities in governance organs also helps address underlying political, social, economic and religious grievances that if not resolved, put local communities at the risk of increased crime and insecurity.</p>\n\n<p>With the 2022 electoral contest just around the corner, competition for power and control of resources in the counties will certainly intensify. As they say, politics is local.</p>\n\n<p>Negotiated democracy is not necessarily bad but should be embraced within the confines of our Constitution and laws and in a manner that does not erode the benefits of devolution or worse, undermine the long-term stability of the country at large.</p>\n\n</article>", "canonicalUrl": "https://www.kbc.co.ke/political-exclusion-in-counties-threatens-lasting-stability-in-the-country/"},{"url": "https://www.kbc.co.ke/end-teenage-pregnancy-towards-eliminating-inequalities-and-new-hiv-infections/", "probability": 0.9966273, "headline": "End teenage pregnancy towards eliminating inequalities and new HIV infections", "datePublished": "2021-12-01T00:00:00", "datePublishedRaw": "2021-12-01", "dateModified": "2021-12-01T00:00:00", "dateModifiedRaw": "2021-12-01", "author": "Alvin Mwangi", "authorsList": ["Alvin Mwangi"], "inLanguage": "en", "mainImage": "https://www.kbc.co.ke/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/Alvin-Mwangi.jpeg", "images": ["https://i2.wp.com/www.kbc.co.ke/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/Alvin-Mwangi.jpeg?fit=739%2C739&ssl=1"], "description": "According to NACC (National AIDs Control Council) 2018 Kenya HIV Estimates, there are 1,388,169 persons living with HIV while the new infections were at 44,789.", "articleBody": "According to NACC (National AIDs Control Council) 2018 Kenya HIV Estimates, there are 1,388,169 persons living with HIV while the new infections were at 44,789.\n\nRecently, NCPD (National Council for Population and Development) released a new Teenage Pregnancies data report in the country which clearly shows adolescents and teenagers, especially girls are at the receiving end from these issues most of the time, as they face stigma, drop out of school among other effects.\n\nIn the report, the major drivers of pregnancies include sexual violence, lack of inadequate information and services on Reproductive health amongst others.\n\nEnding social and health issues that affect the adolescent and young people in all our diversities is key in ensuring a productive economy; they are able to stay in school, work and grow the economy.\n\nIn December 2013, Ministers of Education and Health from 20 east and southern African (ESA) countries came together to endorse and affirm their commitment to better health outcomes for adolescents and young people in the region.\n\nIn their agreement, now commonly known as the ESA Commitment, the Ministers pledged to increase coverage of comprehensive sexuality education, increase access to sexual reproductive health services, reduce unplanned and unintended pregnancies, and eliminate child marriages and gender-based violence among young people in the region by 2020.\n\nKenya being one of the signatories to the ESA Commitments has made strides in the targets but a lot more is needed to ensure that all the adolescents and young people in all their diversities are able to live free from any social and health challenges that are preventable.\n\nAmongst other solutions to solve the social and health problem that is Adolescent and Teenage pregnancy is Access to information on reproductive health including the law.

The number of chronically undernourished continues to rise on the continent to 250 million in 2019, nearly one-fifth of the population. Of this number, 235 million are in sub-Saharan Africa.\n\nAnimal-derived or sourced foods (ASF) have an important role in reducing levels of malnutrition in developing nations. The benefits of consuming a reasonable amount of animal products are well known. Macronutrients such as protein, iron and B vitamins are more available in animal foods than plant sources. Chicken meat, eggs and milk provide high-quality proteins rich in essential amino acids; cereals generally lack these characteristics.\n\nThese foods, therefore, can play a fundamental role in preventing micronutrient deficiencies. The nutrients in these foods are particularly vital in countries where malnutrition and micronutrient deficiencies are rife. The recommended protein requirement of 50-90g per person per day, can be obtained by consuming weekly 300g of meat, 1.75l of milk and milk products, four eggs and 150g of fish.\n\nHigher amounts are recommended for individuals engaging in high physical activity, pregnant or lactating women and children. Studies indicate that children under the age of five years, youth, women and girls, women of childbearing age, and pregnant and lactating women are vulnerable to micronutrient deficiencies, including iron deficiency (Anemia), one of the most prevalent micronutrient deficiencies in the world.\n\nAnimal-derived foods are particularly critical during the first 1,000 days of life because malnutrition experienced during this period (between conception and the child\u2019s second birthday) has the worst adverse long-term effects on the individual\u2019s health and educational achievement. Micronutrient deficiencies increase a person\u2019s vulnerability to infections, abnormalities, impaired development, and lower life expectancy.\n\nNumerous factors increase vulnerability to malnutrition, including physiological and socio-economic factors that influence households and individuals to food and nutrition insecurity. A significant percentage of people in developing nations cannot access these foods.\n\nPoor communities often consume little or no ASF for various reasons, including limited availability, accessibility, affordability, dietary patterns, religious taboos and lack of knowledge on the nutritional attributes of ASF.\n\nIn some areas, cultural and religious beliefs and taboos influence the consumption of such foods. There are restrictions under which ASF can be eaten or by whom; women and children, in particular, are often subject to such limitations. Meat is more likely to be subject to food taboos than any other food.\n\nDespite these challenges, the high potential of ASF to improve the diets of vulnerable populations makes the livestock sector invaluable for national policies and development partner programmes focusing on food security and nutrition.\n\nThe socio-economic role of livestock is substantial in many societies that associate livestock with cultural heritage and customs. Engaging in livestock activities can generate income for livestock keepers. The sale of ASF such as meat, milk, cheese, and eggs, non-food products, and various paid services such as draught power are the main advantages of livestock keeping. The livestock systems support the livelihoods of millions of people and contribute to healthy diets and resilience.\n\nHowever, livestock is a neglected sub-sector, and funding for livestock projects has declined dramatically since 1974, mainly due to livestock\u2019s contribution to climate change. Livestock-derived food production is believed to account for 14.5 per cent of human-induced Green House Gas (GHG) emissions and environmental impacts on biodiversity, freshwater use and disruptions to nutrient flows.\n\nHowever, this depends on production systems, farming practices and supply-chain management, where there may also be opportunities to mitigate these effects. Freshwater use is another challenge faced in livestock-derived food production.\n\nCurrently, significant efforts are being made by development actors such as the Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations (FAO) to improve diets and raise levels of nutrition and mainstream nutrition objectives, activities, and considerations in food and agriculture policies and programmes of countries. There are also efforts to enhance livestock\u2019s contribution to the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) by supporting the transformation of animal production systems to be economically, socially and environmentally sustainable.\n\nFood and nutrition security\n\nThe rising prevalence of child un\u00acdernutrition, as well as adult and child obesity is increasingly evident across many developing countries. Addressing this situation requires integrated, nutrition-sen\u00acsitive actions across the entire food system. Specific actions are required to improve the diets of vulnerable population groups by increasing their intake of nutrient-dense foods (including ASF) to achieve healthier diets for all.\n\nDemand wise, livestock products are likely to grow by close to 50 per cent by 2050, driven by Africa and southern Asia. Leveraging the potential of livestock and optimizing efficiency in production systems is now more important than ever before, given the current global food security and nutrition situation.\n\nCreating an enabling environment for enhanced linkages between livestock and human nutrition is critical. The livestock sector has a great potential to help address malnutrition, especially in regions where livestock production is the principal economic activity; and in areas unsuitable for crop production. using livestock as a pathway out of malnutrition would be a great opportunity.\n\nInstitutional commitments are critical to generating the political will and action necessary to anchor livestock derived foods in sustainable healthy diets. Nutrition education plays a vital role in developing and delivering nutrition-sensitive agricultural development initiatives to ensure increased food production or income translates into diets and nutrition status improvements.\n\nThe evidence base on the impact pathways from livestock to nutrition and successful intervention models is a work in progress and needs to expand. Global, national and local policies and programmes should ensure that people have access to appropriate quantities of livestock-derived foods at critical stages of life for healthy growth and development. These stages start from six months of age, through early childhood, at school age, adolescence, and pregnancy and lactation.\n\nThere is a need for a more equitable distribution of livestock derived foods. The availability and affordability of safe livestock-derived foods in low-and middle-income countries must improve where social and cultural norms permit. Nutrition, health, livestock and sustainability policies at national and international levels need to be well aligned.\n\nTargeting women in livestock programmes will help to increase their control over productive and economic resources and improve the likelihood of directing income earned and food produced for maternal, childcare, and household nutrition and health. Similarly, targeting small-scale producers vulnerable to poverty and malnutrition can help create improved access to high-quality foods.\n\nPolicy and programme support for mixed farming systems that embrace circular agriculture and pastoral systems can help lower the environmental impacts of agriculture, including livestock production.\n\nDeeper insights into the bidirectionality of climate change and livestock-derived food production are needed, together with more evidence on the ability of sustainable food production systems to mitigate, and be resilient to, climate change.

The Presidential Colours are trooped when the Unit Base performs a National Ceremony in which the Commander-in-Chief or Head of State of a foreign country is honoured with a Military Parade also known as Guard of Honour (GOH).</p>\n\n<p>The Regimental Colour is also presented to a Unit at the same time with the Presidential Colour and it is displayed whenever the Unit performs a ceremony for General Officers who are accorded Half Guard Parades during visits. When a Unit is designated to troop its Colour, it becomes an honour to the Regiment as it is now able to showcase its Colour in a ceremony known as \u201cTrooping of Colour\u201d.</p>\n\n<p><strong>SYMBOLISM OF THE COLOUR\u00a0</strong></p>\n\n<p>Since both Presidential and Regimental Colours stand for the honour accorded to the Unit, they are handled with the utmost respect and are saluted as a sign of respect whenever one gets into close proximity to them.</p>\n\n<p>It is, for this reason, people are asked to stand and those in the discipline/Uniformed Forces salute whenever the Colours pass by.</p>\n\n</article>", "canonicalUrl": "https://www.kbc.co.ke/uhuru-presents-presidential-regimental-colours-to-19-battalion/"},{"url": "https://www.kbc.co.ke/new-uhuru-gardens-is-an-altar-for-historical-forgiveness-says-kenyatta/", "probability": 0.99668926, "headline": "New Uhuru Gardens is an altar for historical forgiveness, says Kenyatta", "datePublished": "2021-12-12T00:00:00", "datePublishedRaw": "2021-12-12", "dateModified": "2021-12-12T00:00:00", "dateModifiedRaw": "2021-12-12", "author": "Margaret Kalekye", "authorsList": ["Margaret Kalekye"], "inLanguage": "en", "mainImage": "https://www.kbc.co.ke/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/uhur-gardens.jpg", "images": ["https://i0.wp.com/www.kbc.co.ke/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/uhur-gardens.jpg?fit=960%2C594&ssl=1"], "description": "President Uhuru Kenyatta Sunday paid glowing tribute to Kenya\u2019s remarkable journey towards independence when he led the country in marking the 57th edition of Jamhuri Day Celebrations at Uhuru Gardens memorial park.
