It has been difficult to erase the historical aspect we inherited from the pre-2010 constitution, where investigators were also the prosecutors.\n\nHowever, the ODPP has been holding countrywide stakeholder engagements to sensitise criminal justice actors and the public on what the Constitution says about separation of mandates. We do this through multi-agency and stakeholder workshops, public sensitisation forums on social media (through the ODPP Caf\u00e9) and community dialogues. We have also developed and launched policy documents like the Decision to Charge, Diversion, Plea bargaining, a new prosecutor\u2019s guide to children in the criminal justice system.\n\nThe feud between your office and the Directorate of Criminal Investigations (DCI) is in the public domain. It is disappointing to us who want to see the criminal justice system work smoothly. What can sustainably resolve these disputes? Should the law be amended? Has Parliament shown interest in this matter, which no doubt seems to have slowed the wheels of justice? Moris Komen, Eldoret\n\nThere is no feud. Inter-agency collaboration is critical in ensuring that criminal justice actors discharge their constitutional mandates efficiently. Healthy tension among players helps clarify mandates and responsibilities.\n\nAs the ODPP, we are committed to discharging our mandate and supporting other agencies in executing theirs, all this for the good of the ordinary Kenyans.\n\nThe wheels of justice are moving as fast as they should. We work under the umbrella of the National Council in the Administration of Justice (NCAJ). As an NCAJ member, the ODPP remains committed to the continuous implementation of strategic initiatives that strengthen inter-agency cooperation and improve services.\n\nThe Excellence Charter by your office alludes to a roadmap towards being a 21st-century prosecution service. What is 21st-century prosecution and how will achieve it? Eric Mutai, Nairobi\n\nA 21st-century prosecution is one that is responsive to the needs of mwananchi and upholds the rule of law. A 21st century prosecutor must be able to define and articulate their mandate clearly, promote fair, impartial and expeditious pursuit of justice; promote integrity in the profession and effective coordination in the criminal justice system.\n\nThe Excellence Charter was launched in June to provide a roadmap aimed at transforming the ODPP into a 21st century service, one that is responsive to the needs of mwananchi. The charter is a public document that allows citizens to hold accountable and review any decision the ODPP makes.\n\nThe guideline makes criminal justice accessible and friendly to mwananchi. It also ensures that we undertake and take seriously the ODPP mandate of being the agent of the Executive and delivering quality services.\n\nThe 21st century prosecution service will be achieved over the next three years through six strategic commitments. These are independence and integrity; lifelong learning; reshaping prosecutions; leadership. organisational effectiveness and inter-agency networks.\n\nThese commitments will adopt a 3R approach of Recasting, Retooling and Relearning. Recasting involves collaboration, cooperation and coordination. The Retooling strategy focuses on strengthening and growing existing ODPP infrastructure while the Relearning focuses on equipping employees with the requisite skills and capabilities necessary to deliver our mandate.\n\nThe Judiciary via Court Annexed Mediation is spearheading and advocating alternative dispute resolution mechanisms on land, labour, family environment and other cases. To what extent will this affect the mandate of your office and how are you prepared to remain relevant in the administration of justice? Dan Murugu, Nakuru\n\nThe ODPP primarily handles criminal cases in line with the Constitution and its policies. The Judiciary led court annexed mediation does not apply to criminal cases and will therefore not directly affect our mandate.\n\nIt is notable, however, to note that the ODPP has set up structures for alternatives to prosecution such as diversion and plea bargaining.\n\nDiversion is an alternative to criminal prosecution. It means resolving criminal cases by removing the matter from the court system in deserving situations. Diversion was developed pursuant to the National Prosecution Policy, Article 159 of the Constitution and the International Legal Framework. The Diversion Policy is a first in Kenya and was developed to enable prosecutors shift cases from courts on merit and through agreed structures.\n\nThe ODPP also employs plea bargaining as another alternative means of resolving criminal cases. Not every criminal case should be prosecuted to finality through a trial. What is important is that justice is done. All parties are dealt with fairly and equitably.\n\nIt is important that stakeholders embrace creative provisions in our law to decongest prisons, considering that in some cases remandees remain in custody during proceedings. If properly employed, plea bargaining serves as an important, useful and effective tool to keep justice moving in a timely and cost-effective manner.\n\nThe purpose of plea bargaining is to narrow down the issues in a case to reach a just outcome within the shortest possible time. These alternatives complement the court-annexed mediation and therefore enhance speedy case disposal.\n\nWhat more does the ODPP need to prosecute cases efficiently and effectively? How are you dealing with the missing link to efficient and effective prosecution? Jaswinder Shah, Nairobi\n\nAchieving effective and efficient prosecution is wider than just the office. The criminal justice system needs to be capacitated to realise efficiency and effectiveness. An actor cannot operate in a vacuum. There is a good opportunity to leverage technology to improve the dispensation of justice. The players in the criminal justice system must work together.\n\nOn assuming office, I interrogated the ODPP operations, performance, culture and mindset and noted the urgent need to restructure our focus in a way that would improve services.\n\nThis realisation led us to redirect our strategic focus guided by a three-pronged approach of recasting, retooling and relearning.

Once we are satisfied that it has met the threshold, we shall act accordingly.", "articleBodyHtml": "<article>\n\n<p>The need to usurp emanates from a lack of clear understanding of the mandate of the different criminal justice actors, and especially the ODPP as stipulated in Article 157 of the Constitution. It has been difficult to erase the historical aspect we inherited from the pre-2010 constitution, where investigators were also the prosecutors.</p>\n\n<p>However, the ODPP has been holding countrywide stakeholder engagements to sensitise criminal justice actors and the public on what the Constitution says about separation of mandates. We do this through multi-agency and stakeholder workshops, public sensitisation forums on social media (through the ODPP Caf\u00e9) and community dialogues. We have also developed and launched policy documents like the Decision to Charge, Diversion, Plea bargaining, a new prosecutor\u2019s guide to children in the criminal justice system.</p>\n\n<p><em><strong>The feud between your office and the Directorate of Criminal Investigations (DCI) is in the public domain. It is disappointing to us who want to see the criminal justice system work smoothly. What can sustainably resolve these disputes? Should the law be amended? Has Parliament shown interest in this matter, which no doubt seems to have slowed the wheels of justice?</strong>\u00a0Moris Komen, Eldoret</em></p>\n\n<p>There is no feud. Inter-agency collaboration is critical in ensuring that criminal justice actors discharge their constitutional mandates efficiently. Healthy tension among players helps clarify mandates and responsibilities.</p>\n\n<p>As the ODPP, we are committed to discharging our mandate and supporting other agencies in executing theirs, all this for the good of the ordinary Kenyans.</p>\n\n<p>The wheels of justice are moving as fast as they should. We work under the umbrella of the National Council in the Administration of Justice (NCAJ). As an NCAJ member, the ODPP remains committed to the continuous implementation of strategic initiatives that strengthen inter-agency cooperation and improve services.</p>\n\n<p><em><strong>The Excellence Charter by your office alludes to a roadmap towards being a 21st-century prosecution service. What is 21st-century prosecution and how will achieve it?</strong>\u00a0Eric Mutai, Nairobi\u00a0</em></p>\n\n<p>A 21st-century prosecution is one that is responsive to the needs of mwananchi and upholds the rule of law. A 21st century prosecutor must be able to define and articulate their mandate clearly, promote fair, impartial and expeditious pursuit of justice; promote integrity in the profession and effective coordination in the criminal justice system.</p>\n\n<p>The Excellence Charter was launched in June to provide a roadmap aimed at transforming the ODPP into a 21st century service, one that is responsive to the needs of mwananchi. The charter is a public document that allows citizens to hold accountable and review any decision the ODPP makes.</p>\n\n<p>The guideline makes criminal justice accessible and friendly to mwananchi. It also ensures that we undertake and take seriously the ODPP mandate of being the agent of the Executive and delivering quality services.</p>\n\n<p>The 21st century prosecution service will be achieved over the next three years through six strategic commitments. These are independence and integrity; lifelong learning; reshaping prosecutions; leadership. organisational effectiveness and inter-agency networks.</p>\n\n<p>These commitments will adopt a 3R approach of Recasting, Retooling and Relearning. Recasting involves collaboration, cooperation and coordination. The Retooling strategy focuses on strengthening and growing existing ODPP infrastructure while the Relearning focuses on equipping employees with the requisite skills and capabilities necessary to deliver our mandate.</p>\n\n<p><em><strong>The Judiciary via Court Annexed Mediation is spearheading and advocating alternative dispute resolution mechanisms on land, labour, family environment and other cases. To what extent will this affect the mandate of your office and how are you prepared to remain relevant in the administration of justice?</strong>\u00a0Dan Murugu, Nakuru</em></p>\n\n<p>The ODPP primarily handles criminal cases in line with the Constitution and its policies. The Judiciary led court annexed mediation does not apply to criminal cases and will therefore not directly affect our mandate.</p>\n\n<p>It is notable, however, to note that the ODPP has set up structures for alternatives to prosecution such as diversion and plea bargaining.</p>\n\n<p>Diversion is an alternative to criminal prosecution. It means resolving criminal cases by removing the matter from the court system in deserving situations. Diversion was developed pursuant to the National Prosecution Policy, Article 159 of the Constitution and the International Legal Framework. The Diversion Policy is a first in Kenya and was developed to enable prosecutors shift cases from courts on merit and through agreed structures.</p>\n\n<p>The ODPP also employs plea bargaining as another alternative means of resolving criminal cases. Not every criminal case should be prosecuted to finality through a trial. What is important is that justice is done. All parties are dealt with fairly and equitably.</p>\n\n<p>It is important that stakeholders embrace creative provisions in our law to decongest prisons, considering that in some cases remandees remain in custody during proceedings. If properly employed, plea bargaining serves as an important, useful and effective tool to keep justice moving in a timely and cost-effective manner.</p>\n\n<p>The purpose of plea bargaining is to narrow down the issues in a case to reach a just outcome within the shortest possible time. These alternatives complement the court-annexed mediation and therefore enhance speedy case disposal.</p>\n\n<p><em><strong>What more does the ODPP need to prosecute cases efficiently and effectively?

Contrary to Varshita, who I play on TV, I am by nature reserved and prefer a quiet, simple life.\n\nI avoid conflict, which is not always healthy or helpful. I think one of my biggest flaws is being a people pleaser, which I am definitely working on.\n\nWhen I compare who I am today in my 40\u2019s to who I was in my 20\u2019s, it hits me how worlds apart we are! I still had a lot to learn in my 20\u2019s about working through my insecurities and fears.\n\nI was a mess emotionally but I feel it was inevitable. I experienced a horrific and traumatising carjacking and rape attack at 25. It made me build up my walls even higher. To this day I still do not trust or let people in easily.\n\nDo you believe you are in a better place today?\n\nAt 42, I feel grounded and centered. I am a lot surer of myself, even though I have my own quirky way of working or accomplishing goals. I have confidence in my abilities.\n\nI do not seek outside validation as much, whether it is through social media, my lifestyle, or what family and friends think of me (good or bad). It is a very dangerous place to be when you look to others to approve what we do or who we are.\n\nWhat do you do for a living?\n\nI am the co-founder of Moonbeam Productions alongside the phenomenal TV Producer and my dear friend Lucy Mwangi.\n\nIn the past 10 years, we have produced and developed shows such as Travel Diaries, Mentality, Auntie Boss, Varshita and Njoro wa Uba.\n\nYou had some new projects lined up for 2021, tell us about that?\n\nMy husband and I relocated to Dubai at the end of 2020. It is when I decided to focus on online courses and work towards creating content for YouTube.\n\nI figured I would be able to travel to Kenya when an acting role came up. I did not expect that to happen this year! It was very special for me to play alongside Jimmy Gathu and Sanaipei Tande on the TV series Kina.\n\nAlso, Moonbeam has just wrapped up the production of its first-ever film, which we are so excited about. Look out for it.\n\nWhat is the experience of living in Dubai?\n\nMy husband, Simon, consults in oil and gas and his company office is based in Dubai. When the pandemic made travel difficult, we made the decision to relocate. I never thought I would love living in Dubai as much as I do. I was apprehensive at first as I thought it would be too \u2018glitz and glam\u2019 and a superficial type of lifestyle that I was very uncomfortable adapting to.\n\nI am pleasantly surprised at how comfortable, but down to earth, our life is here. The move has also had a positive effect on my mindset, I am now very keen on health and fitness, self-development, reading and studying online.\n\nI appreciate the break from filming non-stop, so I can for once focus on learning and other things I am passionate about.\n\nWhat do you love about living in Dubai?\n\nI will be honest here, as much as I will always love Kenya, for the first time in my entire life, I feel safe. That is the greatest gift Dubai has given me.\n\nI feel a lot more relaxed and this has impacted my well-being in many ways. Following the attack in my 20\u2019s, I had nightmares right up until mid-last year. They have stopped for now and I am working on fully healing from that experience.\n\nYou got married last year in a very private and intimate event, what was your favourite thing about the day?\n\nSimon and I had initially wanted a destination wedding in 2020 and thought it was a great idea. Then we started planning it in January and February of 2020 and realised we both felt so stressed and miserable about it.\n\nAs much as I have been on radio and TV, I honestly do not like being the centre of attention; we wanted the day to be about us and our union, not a big complicated production.\n\nWe cancelled the plans for the wedding and told our family and friends we had decided to do the civil ceremony at Sheria House and then go on a five-week honeymoon.\n\nThen Covid-19 hit. We did have the civil ceremony, which was a lot nicer than I had imagined it would be. I loved how stress-free and how present I was on the day, it really felt very special.\n\nWe even had time for a couples massage in the afternoon after the celebratory lunch. I would recommend it to any couple who does not enjoy the circus of a big wedding.\n\nHow did you and Simon meet?\n\nWe met on a dating app! In early 2018, I told myself I needed to step out of my comfort zone if I wanted my dating life to improve. I just found it very difficult to meet a man I could see a future with.\n\nMaybe I was not ready and had to work through my own baggage or maybe it is just really difficult to date in Nairobi. But I had had enough. I have always wanted companionship, over anything else.\n\nSomeone I could share my life with. So even though I knew I was in the public eye, I determined to try something different. I signed up and started swiping right.\n\nWe matched on the first day. We chatted via text on the second day and he made me laugh so hard, it felt unexpectedly comfortable. By day three, we had gone on our first date. We dated for a month before making it official. And the rest as they say is history.\n\nYou also got married later than the societal expected 20s, what do you believe has been the blessings of the wait?\n\nI was 41 when I got married, and Simon was the same age.

We decided to part ways long before the birth of our daughter, but we continue to co-parent. We also thought it wise to make it public because we were no longer being seen together, and many had begun questioning that.\n\nTherefore, to avoid rumors and for the sake of ourselves and business, we decided to make it public that we were no longer operating as a unit. Let it be known that our decision to part ways was discussed at length, not only by us but also our families.\n\nDid you (really) have to make it public?\n\nYes, we had to. When we started out, we made it public and, now that people were no longer seeing us together, we had to arrest the issue before it turned into something else. Rumour isn\u2019t something really nice, especially when you are in the limelight; like us. It might cost you your business and sanity.\n\nYou got back together the other day and you parted ways again. You mind sharing what happened?\n\nAt the moment, I am not very comfortable sharing the reasons behind our break up, because of the situation we are in and also for the sanity of our baby.\n\nSome day the truth will come out, there is a lot in the grapevine. Our close friends know what has been going on. For now, we agreed not to disclose that to the public because most of the time people use other people\u2019s trouble as a source of entertainment or to clout-chase.\n\nSome people believe this is some sort of clout chase.\n\nNo. We are not clout chasing, because there is nothing we stand to gain from that. This was just us letting the public know we are no longer together. If anything, I am known for my work, not clout.\n\nThere is word that you cheated on Sonnie.\n\n(Laughs). There is a lot going on, but there is what transpired and broke the camel\u2019s back. Like I said, some day the truth will come out and people will understand why all this happened. It\u2019s not that easy for a man to just leave his young family or home. I\u2019m not insane, I\u2019m not mad! I was very serious with that relationship, wanting to see it work and make a home.\n\nIs that why you moved on so fast?\n\nI have been dating my current girlfriend for some time now. I would not want to disclose much into when we began seeing each other. But, like I said, Sonnie and I parted ways a longtime ago even before the birth of our child. Sonnie has been seeing someone else since we split too.\n\nSome quarters argue that your new relationship is some sort of a rebound.\n\nWell. Then let\u2019s give it the test of time. If the proof of the pudding is in the eating, you can\u2019t speculate by just looking at it. I am hopeful this relationship will last.\n\nYou once complained of cyberbullying yet you keep sharing your life on social media?\n\nI got used to cyberbullying; I grew a thick skin because no matter how you try to address the issue, you will still meet the trolls.\n\nSo, the only way is to adapt and move on. Besides, I am online to make money. It does not really matter if you get a few burns in the kitchen as long as the food gets cooked.\n\nLately, more of your life has been on social media than the digital content that made you famous?\n\nThat\u2019s very true. This is because so much was going on; I was expecting a baby and my relationship was crumbling. All these were happening while I was busy trying to re-strategise my brand to make it better\u2026 All these made it very difficult for me to continue creating content consistently like before.\n\nRe-strategising, how so?\n\nStarting next year, there will be so much \u201cnew me\u201d. Expect to see me in movies, TV series and also taking on live performances.\n\nHow has the split affected your corporate deals?\n\nThere are some corporate deals that require influential couples. I have missed a number of those. There were also times we would pitch ideas to corporates as a couple and land deals. That is not possible now.\n\nBut I am still doing good. I still have a number of endorsements because my brand is a clean one. Breakups are common. I am still the brand ambassador for Kenya Cane. The contract was renewed and that can only mean I am delivering. I also have a number of shows on the pipeline.\n\nHow is the boda boda business?\n\nI own 17 motorbikes. Each bike fetches me Sh350 a day, for six days in a week. If you do the math that is around Sh142,800 a month. I have already been approached by a motorcycle brand, to endorse them. The talks are ongoing and we\u2019ll announce the deal once the paperwork is done.\n\nBut the beauty of it all is that I have been able to employ a number of people. Seventeen young men who were jobless now have something to do. There is a supervisor on retainer and a manager in charge of repairs. The number of bikes is increasing, we are selling the old ones and replacing them as we also strive to buy as many as we can.\n\nThe aim here is not to make money but to impact the society, because employment is no longer guaranteed even when you are educated. Believe me, Sh350 is a small fraction of what they make a day.\n\nA post shared by Kendrick Mulamwah (@mulamwah)", "articleBodyHtml": "<article xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">\n\n<p><img src=\"https://nairobiwire.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/mulam.jpg\" alt=\"\" srcset=\"https://nairobiwire.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/mulam.jpg 850w, https://nairobiwire.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/mulam-300x162.jpg 300w, https://nairobiwire.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/mulam-768x416.jpg 768w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 850px) 100vw, 850px\">Comedian David Onyando alias Mulamwah talks about his highly-publicized break up with Carrol Sonie, his new girlfriend, cyberbullying and more.</p>\n\n<p><strong><em>What is really going on between you and Sonie?</em></strong></p>\n\n<p>A lot has been going on between us.

It might cost you your business and sanity.</p>\n\n<p><strong><em>You got back together the other day and you parted ways again. You mind sharing what happened?</em></strong></p>\n\n<p>At the moment, I am not very comfortable sharing the reasons behind our break up, because of the situation we are in and also for the sanity of our baby.</p>\n\n<p>Some day the truth will come out, there is a lot in the grapevine. Our close friends know what has been going on. For now, we agreed not to disclose that to the public because most of the time people use other people\u2019s trouble as a source of entertainment or to clout-chase.</p>\n\n<p><em><strong>Some people believe this is some sort of clout chase.</strong></em></p>\n\n<p>No. We are not clout chasing, because there is nothing we stand to gain from that. This was just us letting the public know we are no longer together. If anything, I am known for my work, not clout.</p>\n\n<p><em><strong>There is word that you cheated on Sonnie.</strong></em></p>\n\n<p>(Laughs). There is a lot going on, but there is what transpired and broke the camel\u2019s back. Like I said, some day the truth will come out and people will understand why all this happened. It\u2019s not that easy for a man to just leave his young family or home. I\u2019m not insane, I\u2019m not mad! I was very serious with that relationship, wanting to see it work and make a home.</p>\n\n<p><strong><em>Is that why you moved on so fast?</em></strong></p>\n\n<p>I have been dating my current girlfriend for some time now. I would not want to disclose much into when we began seeing each other. But, like I said, Sonnie and I parted ways a longtime ago even before the birth of our child. Sonnie has been seeing someone else since we split too.<img src=\"https://nairobiwire.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/mulamwah1-1.jpg\" alt=\"\" srcset=\"https://nairobiwire.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/mulamwah1-1.jpg 699w, https://nairobiwire.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/mulamwah1-1-300x166.jpg 300w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 699px) 100vw, 699px\"></p>\n\n<p><em><strong>Some quarters argue that your new relationship is some sort of a rebound.</strong></em></p>\n\n<p>Well. Then let\u2019s give it the test of time. If the proof of the pudding is in the eating, you can\u2019t speculate by just looking at it. I am hopeful this relationship will last.</p>\n\n<p><em><strong>You once complained of cyberbullying yet you keep sharing your life on social media?</strong></em></p>\n\n<p>I got used to cyberbullying; I grew a thick skin because no matter how you try to address the issue, you will still meet the trolls.</p>\n\n<p>So, the only way is to adapt and move on. Besides, I am online to make money. It does not really matter if you get a few burns in the kitchen as long as the food gets cooked.</p>\n\n<p><em><strong>Lately, more of your life has been on social media than the digital content that made you famous?</strong></em></p>\n\n<p>That\u2019s very true. This is because so much was going on; I was expecting a baby and my relationship was crumbling. All these were happening while I was busy trying to re-strategise my brand to make it better\u2026\u00a0All these made it very difficult for me to continue creating content consistently like before.</p>\n\n<p><em><strong>Re-strategising, how so?</strong></em></p>\n\n<p>Starting next year, there will be so much \u201cnew me\u201d. Expect to see me in movies, TV series and also taking on live performances.</p>\n\n<p><em><strong>How has the split affected your corporate deals?</strong></em></p>\n\n<p>There are some corporate deals that require influential couples. I have missed a number of those. There were also times we would pitch ideas to corporates as a couple and land deals. That is not possible now.</p>\n\n<p>But I am still doing good. I still have a number of endorsements because my brand is a clean one. Breakups are common. I am still the brand ambassador for Kenya Cane. The contract was renewed and that can only mean I am delivering. I also have a number of shows on the pipeline.</p>\n\n<p><strong><em>How is the boda boda business?</em></strong></p>\n\n<p>I own 17 motorbikes. Each bike fetches me Sh350 a day, for six days in a week. If you do the math that is around Sh142,800 a month. I have already been approached by a motorcycle brand, to endorse them. The talks are ongoing and we\u2019ll announce the deal once the paperwork is done.</p>\n\n<p>But the beauty of it all is that I have been able to employ a number of people. Seventeen young men who were jobless now have something to do. There is a supervisor on retainer and a manager in charge of repairs. The number of bikes is increasing, we are selling the old ones and replacing them as we also strive to buy as many as we can.</p>\n\n<p>The aim here is not to make money but to impact the society, because employment is no longer guaranteed even when you are educated. Believe me, Sh350 is a small fraction of what they make a day.</p>\n\n<blockquote class=\"instagram-media\" data-instgrm-captioned=\"\" data-instgrm-permalink=\"https://www.instagram.com/p/CXOPa6PMOoi/?utm_source=ig_embed&amp;utm_campaign=loading\" data-instgrm-version=\"14\"><div>\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n<p><a href=\"https://www.instagram.com/p/CXOPa6PMOoi/?utm_source=ig_embed&amp;utm_campaign=loading\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">A post shared by Kendrick Mulamwah (@mulamwah)</a></p>\n</div></blockquote>\n\n</article>"},{"url": "https://nairobiwire.com/2021/12/maina-kageni-announces-retirement-plan.html", "probability": 0.9286781, "headline": "Maina Kageni Announces Retirement Plan", "datePublished": "2021-12-10T06:47:00", "datePublishedRaw": "/ Friday, 10 Dec 2021 06:47AM /", "author": "Richard Kamau", "authorsList": ["Richard Kamau"], "inLanguage": "en", "mainImage": "https://nairobiwire.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/maina-kageni.jpg", "images": ["https://nairobiwire.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/maina-kageni.jpg"], "description": "Veteran radio personality Maina Kageni is finally ready to quit the airwaves.The Classic 105 radio presenter announced he is planning to hang up the microphone during his morning breakfast show on Thursday.Maina Kageni said he is planning to retire next year.

This narrative was to change for the better. While on duty, one of the customers informed me of a secretary job in his real estate office. I resigned to join the firm. I worked as a cyber caf\u00e9 attendant for eight months and as a secretary for six years. The latter had better pay compared with the previous one.\n\nWhy the real estate and consultancy business?\n\nThroughout my six years of experience at the real estate firm, I learnt a lot that inspired me to start and own a real estate company. Seeing it as an industry that was growing fast, and having witnessed the success stories of other players in the industry, I ventured into the male-dominated field. I knew it was worth the gamble, took out my savings and registered my company, Diligent Realtors. I can say the gamble was worth it.\n\nWhat does Diligent Realtors entail?\n\nThe firm deals in real estate management and consultancy. I got my first client to manage his three apartments while still a secretary. It was then that I quit to fully focus on my company.\n\nHow much did you make from your first client?\n\nIt was not much but it looked impressive away from what I was earning as a salary. I made Sh30,000 which I used to set up a small office in Thika town and quit employment.\n\nHow has the real estate sector been like and the challenges?\n\nThere is much to be done in this sector. It is an industry that is always evolving based on diverse factors ranging from new technological innovations to design trends and structural growth. This calls for creativity and collaboration with experts and developers.\n\nDespite tough government regulations, there are a lot of challenges in this sector, especially in property management, like a case where a client expects you to bank rental collections as per your agreement with them but some tenants have defaulted or delayed making payments. To bridge the shortfall, you use your savings or even take a loan to meet the clients\u2019 demands. You want to have loyal clients who trust you than lose them to your competition and you\u2019ve to make such sacrifices.\n\nHow long have you been in this business and how do you charge for consultancy?\n\nIt\u2019s been five years, now managing properties and offering consultancy services. In collaboration with other real estate developers, we have ventured into property sales. In real estate consultancy, we have specialised in investment and financial advice to clients looking to buy, sell or invest in the property market. Our charges depend on the type of consulting one is seeking.\n\nReal estate has many facets and requires different and specific knowledge and expertise\n\nWhat did employment teach you and would you consider employment again?\n\nBeing employed is not that bad since one guaranteed pay at the end of the month, but being your own boss is taking risks of the unexpected.\n\nComparing the period, I was employed to that I have been my own boss, I would choose business and being a job creator since there is much that come with it like management, responsibility, timely decision making and creativity. You don\u2019t grow in employment but in business you do. I would never consider employment again.\n\nHow has the business growth been like?\n\nIt\u2019s been steady but not without lots of challenges along the way. It began with managing three units and the number has risen to 50 units and counting currently. With the growth came employment opportunities for others. The company currently has 12 staff under monthly salary and other employees contracted on a commission basis.\n\nWhich business mistakes do you regret?\n\nI have not made many mistakes worth regretting but I have made a lot of failures like investing in ventures that end up as big losses. I take them as a challenge to move to the next step.\n\nHow much can the business generate monthly?\n\nWith the changes in the industry, you can\u2019t have a correct estimate but on a conservative end, the company can bank up to Sh200,000 per month after expenses.\n\nDo you invest profits in a different area or reinvest in business?\n\nWith business growth and my primary interest being in the real estate sector, most of the profit is channeled back into the business to buy more properties for sale and also grow the company assets and liabilities.\n\nWhat business lessons have you learned in the process?\n\nIn the half a decade in business, I have learned the value of meeting expectations and delivering to a client\u2019s satisfaction. Moreover, we need to mitigate problems as swiftly as possible and consult others in the industry as well as apply advice given.\n\nWhat business advice can you give?\n\nThere comes a time when you will need to look forward to the next step of your business. You do not want to remain at the same level doing the same things, and so you need to make crucial decisions that will determine the trajectory of your business.

This narrative was to change for the better. While on duty, one of the customers informed me of a secretary job in his real estate office. I resigned to join the firm. I worked as a cyber caf\u00e9 attendant for eight months and as a secretary for six years. The latter had better pay compared with the previous one.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Why the real estate and consultancy business?</strong></p>\n\n<p>Throughout my six years of experience at the real estate firm, I learnt a lot that inspired me to start and own a real estate company. Seeing it as an industry that was growing fast, and having witnessed the success stories of other players in the industry, I ventured into the male-dominated field. I knew it was worth the gamble, took out my savings and registered my company, Diligent Realtors. I can say the gamble was worth it.</p>\n\n<p><strong>What does Diligent Realtors entail?</strong></p>\n\n<p>The firm deals in real estate management and consultancy. I got my first client to manage his three apartments while still a secretary. It was then that I quit to fully focus on my company.</p>\n\n<p><strong>\u00a0How much did you make from your first client?</strong></p>\n\n<p>It was not much but it looked impressive away from what I was earning as a salary.\u00a0I made Sh30,000 which I used to set\u00a0up a small office in Thika town and quit employment.</p>\n\n<p><strong>How has the real estate sector been like and the challenges?</strong></p>\n\n<p>There is much to be done in this sector. It is an industry that is always evolving based on diverse factors ranging from new technological innovations to design trends and structural growth. This calls for creativity and collaboration with experts and developers.</p>\n\n<p>Despite tough government regulations, there are a lot of challenges in this sector, especially in property management, like a case where a client expects you to bank rental collections as per your agreement with them but some tenants have defaulted or delayed making payments. To bridge the shortfall, you use your savings or even take a loan to meet the clients\u2019 demands. You want to have loyal clients who trust you than lose them to your competition and you\u2019ve to make such sacrifices.</p>\n\n<p><strong>How long have you been in this business and how do you charge for consultancy?</strong></p>\n\n<p>It\u2019s been five years, now managing properties and offering consultancy services. In collaboration with other real estate developers, we have ventured into property sales. In real estate consultancy, we have specialised in investment and financial advice to clients looking to buy, sell or invest in the property market. Our charges depend on the type of consulting one is seeking.</p>\n\n<p>Real estate has many facets and requires different and specific knowledge and expertise</p>\n\n<p><strong>What did employment teach you and would you consider employment again?</strong></p>\n\n<p>Being employed is not that bad since one guaranteed pay at the end of the month, but being your own boss is taking risks of the unexpected.</p>\n\n<p>Comparing the period, I was employed to that I have been my own boss, I would choose business and being a job creator since there is much that come with it like management, responsibility, timely decision making and creativity. You don\u2019t grow in employment but in business you do. I would never consider employment again.</p>\n\n<p><strong>How has the business growth been like?</strong></p>\n\n<p>It\u2019s been steady but not without lots of challenges along the way. It began with managing three units and the number has risen to 50 units and counting currently. With the growth came employment opportunities for others. The company currently has 12 staff under monthly salary and other employees contracted on a commission basis.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Which business mistakes do you regret?</strong></p>\n\n<p>I have not made many mistakes worth regretting but I have made a lot of failures like investing in ventures that end up as big losses. I take them as a challenge to move to the next step.</p>\n\n<p><strong>How much can the business generate monthly?</strong></p>\n\n<p>With the changes in the industry, you can\u2019t have a correct\u00a0estimate but on a conservative end, the company can bank up to Sh200,000 per month after expenses.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Do you invest profits in a different area or reinvest in business?</strong></p>\n\n<p>With business growth and my primary interest being in the real estate sector, most of the profit is channeled back into the business to buy more properties for sale and also grow the company assets and liabilities.</p>\n\n<p><strong>What business lessons have you learned in the process?</strong></p>\n\n<p>In the half a decade in business, I have learned the value of meeting expectations and delivering to a client\u2019s satisfaction. Moreover, we need to mitigate problems as swiftly as possible and consult others in the industry as well as apply advice given.</p>\n\n<p><strong>What business advice can you give?</strong></p>\n\n<p>There comes a time when you will need to look forward to the next step of your business. You do not want to remain at the same level doing the same things, and so you need to make crucial decisions that will determine the trajectory of your business. You should make smart and timely decisions.</p>\n\n<p>To all the budding entrepreneurs, make sure the goals you set are realistic. If they are too big, break them down. It will encourage you as you move along and your ultimate goal should never change. Broaden your horizons and transform that business idea into a brand.</p>\n\n</article>"},{"url": "https://nairobiwire.com/2021/11/you-wont-believe-all-these-products-are-made-in-kitui-photos.html", "probability": 0.93427515, "headline": "You Won\u2019t Believe All These Products are Made in Kitui (PHOTOS)", "datePublished": "2021-11-25T06:50:00", "datePublishedRaw": "/ Thursday, 25 Nov 2021 06:50AM /", "author": "Richard Kamau", "authorsList": ["Richard Kamau"], "inLanguage": "en", "mainImage": "https://nairobiwire.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/kitui10.jpg", "images": ["https://nairobiwire.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/devcon.jpg", "https://nairobiwire.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/kitui12.jpg", "https://nairobiwire.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/kitui11.jpg", "https://nairobiwire.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/kitui.jpg"], "description": "\u00a0", "articleBody": "In a country that is devoid of enough locally-made products, Kitui Governor Charity Ngilu has taken it upon herself to make the county the manufacturing hub of Kenya.\n\nThe governor proved she is up to the task at the seventh devolution conference in Wote, Makueni which closes on Friday, November 26.\n\nTo say that Kitui county\u2019s display booth at DevCon was impressive would be an understatement.
