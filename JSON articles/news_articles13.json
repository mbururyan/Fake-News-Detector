No one will give you a manual job and let you off at midday. Mostly I would just come in at 4 pm and get a mouthful from the nurse in charge of the Kangaroo care. She had the best interest of my wife and children at hand so I understood the concerns,\u201d the father of two explains.\n\nThe hospital had floated the option of the parents transferring the twins to a more established facility, Kenyatta National Hospital, being the most affordable option so the infants would be in an incubator.\n\n\u201cWe just could not get the funds so we resulted to the Kangaroo care which was the best option and chance for our children\u2019s survival. My wife bore the burden bravely and I couldn\u2019t ask for a better partner,\u201d offered the father.\n\nTwo months into the Kangaroo care, a miracle happened! In one of their CSR projects that involves equipping health facilities across the country, Mozzart had identified the health facility and had elected to equip the maternity wing.\n\nAmong the donations was a baby incubator, the others included 4\u00d72 crank beds with mattresses, two patient monitors with stands, two Oxygen Concentrators, four bedside lockers, one foetal doppler and monitor and a Digital BMI scale.\n\n\u201cLife changed when the hospital got the incubator. The twins a better chance at life. They had fought for two months and we knew they had it in them to go all the way. For the next two months in the incubator, it was easier for me. I had more time to work and only came in in the evening to check on them. It was a weight lifted off my shoulders as I knew they were safe and my wife would also get some time to rest,\u201d said an elated Lisanza.\n\nFour months after Annabell and Christabel were born, their parents were finally allowed to move out of hospital and have their children at home, albeit under very strict guidelines on what they have to do.\n\nOne year on, Annabell and Christabel Lisanza celebrated their first birthday in a big way, back at the facility that was their home for the first four months of their life and Mozzart was at hand with more for the parents and the facility.\n\nWith Sa\u0161a Krneta, the company\u2019s Country Manager in attendance alongside Marketing Manager Frank Ochieng, the leading gaming firm on 10 December donated a 75 litres Autoclave as well as a Vital signs monitor.\n\nLisanza\u2019s family also got essentials for their children as the facility\u2019s staff joined them in cake cutting to celebrate their babies\u2019 milestones.\n\n\u201cWere it not for the Mozzart\u2019s donation I don\u2019t know how long we would have been in hospital and how life would have panned out. I am grateful to the company for the donations and for helping the medical staff at Waithaka to take the best care of my babies. We cannot thank you enough for this noble initiative and pray that you continue helping other parents in need especially,\u201d the elated father said.\n\nWhile his family is doing well, the former matatu driver who before Covid-19 hit also had a side hustle caring for and training domestic dogs is hoping for a break in his finances.\n\nin Sponsored", "articleBodyHtml": "<article>\n\n<p>Elizabeth Wanjiku, a six-month pregnant mother walked into Waithaka Health Centre, on Monday 8 November worried for her unborn twins.</p>\n\n<p>Moments later, her daughters Annabell and Christabel Lisanza were safely delivered but that\u2019s just about the only good news Wanjiku and her husband Milton Lisanza for an eventful two months.</p>\n\n<figure><a href=\"http://www.ghafla.com/sponsored/wp-content/uploads/sites/16/2021/12/IMG-20211212-WA0009.jpg\"><img src=\"http://www.ghafla.com/sponsored/wp-content/uploads/sites/16/2021/12/IMG-20211212-WA0009.jpg\" alt=\"\" srcset=\"http://www.ghafla.com/sponsored/wp-content/uploads/sites/16/2021/12/IMG-20211212-WA0009.jpg 1599w, http://www.ghafla.com/sponsored/wp-content/uploads/sites/16/2021/12/IMG-20211212-WA0009-300x169.jpg 300w, http://www.ghafla.com/sponsored/wp-content/uploads/sites/16/2021/12/IMG-20211212-WA0009-1024x576.jpg 1024w, http://www.ghafla.com/sponsored/wp-content/uploads/sites/16/2021/12/IMG-20211212-WA0009-768x432.jpg 768w, http://www.ghafla.com/sponsored/wp-content/uploads/sites/16/2021/12/IMG-20211212-WA0009-1536x864.jpg 1536w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1599px) 100vw, 1599px\"></a></figure>\n\n<p>Born three months early, Lisanza\u2019s daughters were, as expected, pre-term.
