If the changes will be adopted by the National Assembly, members of parties in a coalition will be allowed to hop as long as they defect to an outfit that is within the arrangement.\n\nThis one is one of the key strategies the President and the former Prime Minister have employed to corner Deputy President William Ruto, who has insisted that he will not work with small parties.\n\nIEBC Concerned as Parliament Fails to Enact Electoral Laws\n\nThe Independent Electoral and Boundaries Commission (IEBC) has said preparations for the 2022 General Election are in limbo due to a lack of clear laws to guide the process.\n\nThe commission\u2019s acting Chief Executive Officer Marjan Hussein lamented that the National Assembly has delayed in enacting new laws to avoid repetition of mistakes that led to the nullification of the 2017 presidential election over the transmission of results.\n\nHe noted that if MPs, who have already gone on recess, fail to convene a special sitting to make amendments to the Elections Act, the technical errors could plague the 2022 poll again.\n\nAre Uhuru And Raila Behind Small Parties?\n\nIt is now emerging that President Uhuru Kenyatta and ODM leader Raila Odinga could be the architects behind a wave of small parties across the country.\n\nIn recent months, some cabinet secretaries and governors have been launching regional outfits and the common denominator is that the parties are backing the former Prime Minister for President.

Know your customers\n\nInvest your time in finding out your target clients. This will help you determine the kind of products you are going to stock your shop with.

Look for a mentor\n\nDo not make your business venture an independent journey. Do proper networking with several business leaders who are successful in what you plan to do.\n\nA business mentor will help you sharpen your skills and enhance your mental and financial preparedness when it comes to the risks that come in handy.\n\nAttend several business workshops and seminars to interact with various business magnates and learn their approaches and secrets to success.\n\n5. Hire professionals\n\nYou are not good at everything, this is a fact. Consider hiring experts who will handle several departments of your business. Make contacts with people like lawyers who will advise you and keep you on the right path with the law. Also, get an accountant to help you handle every aspect of finance and help you realize profits.\n\nHiring experts will boost the professionalism of your business and attract more clients.", "articleBodyHtml": "<article>\n\n<p>Out of job?

However, experts warn, an obsession can be diagnosed as orthorexia. An unhealthy focus on eating can damage the well-being of your body and mind. Eating disorders can cause serious health problems and even death if left untreated. It is also considered a mental health condition marked by an obsession with food or body shape. It affects mostly young women and here are some of the signs you might be suffering from it, according to mental health professionals:\n\nFear of food\n\nOne may end up starving oneself simply because one doesn\u2019t want to gain weight. The society has made women believe that they ought to have an hourglass figure in order to be presentable. The unrealistic expectations make some eat only vegetables and avoid other food, which is important for the body to grow.\n\nAlways tired\n\nWhen your body is not given enough nutrients it lacks the energy to be active. If you always feeling exhausted at all times this simply means you may be experiencing an eating disorder.\n\nThis shows lack of confidence in how your body looks like and that is why one ends up putting on loosely fitting clothes. Most people were made to believe that being fat is ugly and unhealthy but the truth is as long as you\u2019re comfortable with your body then you\u2019re good to go.\n\nAvoiding mirrors\n\nThis is because you have the fear that you may have grown too big or skinny. Others end up always constantly being in front of the mirror to check if they are getting to where they wish their body to be. At the end one ends up being disappointed if their expectations are not fulfilled.\n\nComparing your body to others\n\nTrying to get a tiny waist like the one you spotted on social media, wider hips or slim arms.\n\nComparison is the killer of joy and one oughts to understand that all bodies are different and you can\u2019t try being like someone else. Also in this era people are paying large amounts of money to get a plastic surgery. So the least you can do is accept your body as natural as it comes.\n\nObsessively thinking about food\n\nSince it\u2019s a mental condition, in such cases one may end up overeating because of stress. This does not only mean those who consider themselves skinny but also one who criticises themselves for having a big body will end up eating every minute because of anxiety.\n\nIsolating oneself\n\nAvoiding social gatherings and locking yourself at home alone because you fear what someone may say about your weight or body. This may slowly lead to depression because most of the time we end up overthinking and no one is too concerned about you it\u2019s always in your head.", "articleBodyHtml": "<article>\n\n<p>Eating foods that are nutritious is good for the body.

The unrealistic expectations make some eat only vegetables and avoid other food, which is important for the body to grow.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Always tired</strong></p>\n\n<p>When your body is not given enough nutrients it lacks the energy to be active. If you always feeling exhausted at all times this simply means you may be experiencing an eating disorder.</p>\n\n<p>This shows lack of confidence in how your body looks like and that is why one ends up putting on loosely fitting clothes. \u00a0Most people were made to believe that being fat is ugly and unhealthy but the truth is as long as you\u2019re comfortable with your body then you\u2019re good to go.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Avoiding mirrors</strong></p>\n\n<p>This is because you have the fear that you may have grown too big or skinny. Others end up always constantly being in front of the mirror to check if they are getting to where they wish their body to be. At the end one ends up being disappointed if their expectations are not fulfilled.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Comparing your body to others</strong></p>\n\n<p>Trying to get a tiny waist like the one you spotted on social media, wider hips or slim arms.</p>\n\n<p>Comparison is the killer of joy and one oughts to understand that all bodies are different and you can\u2019t try being like someone else. Also in this era people are paying large amounts of money to get a plastic surgery. So the least you can do is accept your body as natural as it comes.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Obsessively thinking about food\u00a0</strong></p>\n\n<p>Since it\u2019s a mental condition, in such cases one may end up overeating because of stress. This does not only mean those who consider themselves skinny but also one who criticises themselves for having a big body will end up eating every minute because of anxiety.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Isolating oneself</strong></p>\n\n<p>Avoiding social gatherings and locking yourself at home alone because you fear what someone may say about your weight or body. This may slowly lead to depression because most of the time we end up overthinking and no one is too concerned about you it\u2019s always in your head.</p>\n\n</article>", "canonicalUrl": "https://litkenya.com/what-an-eating-disorder-looks-like/"},{"url": "https://litkenya.com/what-healthy-breakfast-looks-like-and-its-importance/", "probability": 0.95566016, "headline": "What Healthy Breakfast Looks Like And Its Importance", "datePublished": "2021-03-26T15:00:59+00:00", "datePublishedRaw": "2021-03-26T15:00:59+00:00", "dateModified": "2021-03-26T15:01:00+00:00", "dateModifiedRaw": "2021-03-26T15:01:00+00:00", "author": "Helen Ndubi", "authorsList": ["Helen Ndubi"], "inLanguage": "en", "breadcrumbs": [{"name": "Home", "link": "https://litkenya.com/"}, {"name": "Lifestyle", "link": "https://litkenya.com/lifestyle/"}, {"name": "Health", "link": "https://litkenya.com/lifestyle/health/"}, {"name": "What Healthy Breakfast Looks Like And Its Importance"}], "mainImage": "https://i2.wp.com/litkenya.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/4398E6E1-4651-499A-AF18-7F0B5FD09DC7.png?fit=1200%2C675&ssl=1", "description": "LitKenya.com aims to delight our consumers through original, relevant, concise and engaging content.", "articleBody": "Breakfast is everything and is often termed as \u201cthe most important meal of the day\u201d.\n\nChoosing healthy foods to start your day and eating in the required portions is essential.\n\nPorridge made from rolled oats, whole grain cereals with milk, smoothies made from fresh fruits and vegetables, fresh fruits and raw nuts, arrow roots, yams, and sweet potatoes can be incorporated into your morning meal.\n\nMany studies have outlined the health benefits from eating breakfast.\n\nImproves your energy levels\n\nIt replenishes your supply of glucose, providing nutrients that are essential for better health and also boosting the energy levels in the body.

original, relevant, concise and engaging content.", "articleBody": "Our invention revolutionises the habit of chewing the stimulant, making it easier, hygienic and user friendly.\n\nKnowing that many consumers of miraa are Muslims, we deliberately made the miraa chewing gum halal by replacing gelatin, in its formulation, with gum Arabica.\n\nIn the Islamic faith, gelatin, which maintains the soft texture in every chewing, is haram because it is derived from pork.\n\nWhereas this invention does not seek to replace the habit of chewing raw khat in its entirety, it makes the luxurious pastime less laborious and the product cheaper and easier to handle and preserve.\n\nThe invention also standardises the miraa product, making its pricing easier and convenient for traders and retailers to dispense.\n\nFurther, the invention guarantees traceability of miraa to the farm.\nTraceability of agricultural products to the farm is a compulsory requirement for miraa to reenter the European market.\n\nThe new chewing gum enters the markets in sticks the size of the conventional BigG, each with an average weight of five grams.\nThe stimulating refreshment retails in sachets each containing eight sticks of five grams each.\n\nA carton of the product contains 60 sachets going for Ksh2,800.\n\nThe minimum recommended retail price per sachet is Ksh70.\n\nAs we roll out the

When all the rest were held by collective ignorance and the comfort of misinformed numbers (we can\u2019t all be wrong!), the single souls kept going, fired by their firm belief in their conviction and purpose.</p>\n\n<p>It\u2019s only when they did it that \u2018all the rest\u2019 joined in the bandwagon of the oohs and aahs of the breakthrough.</p>\n\n<p>Yes, you alone can be right on something, and all the rest be wrong. It\u2019s the way to great discoveries, spectacular breakthroughs and world changing ideas.</p>\n\n<p>Same thing with matters Faith.</p>\n\n<p>It all comes down to looking at yourself through the eyes of God. Whatever anyone else sees in you must not override your conviction and purpose as you see in yourself through the eyes of God, starting with the day to day living in our simple routine lives.</p>\n\n<p>It could be fidelity to your spouse/partner, commitment to your calling (family, business, ministry, etc), deliberate living against vice (gossip, malice, vengeance, envy, jealousy, conniving, collusion, scheming, etc)\u2026all the virtues, even when the world has normalized the otherwise.</p>\n\n<p>Reminds me of a story i have shared here before on a discussion we once had with the late Archbishop Ndingi mwana Nzeki on matters family planning and the Church stand. His stand was the clincher which perhaps sums up todays reflection:</p>\n\n<p>\u201cRight is right is right, even if no one does it. Wrong is wrong is wrong, even if everyone is doing it\u201d.</p>\n\n<p>Have a singularly right reflective Sunday (even if no one else does it), and a great week ahead.</p>\n\n</article>", "canonicalUrl": "https://litkenya.com/the-challenge-to-conviction-purpose-you-can-be-the-singular-game-changer/"},{"url": "https://litkenya.com/its-not-an-important-affair-as-women-hijack-mens-day/", "probability": 0.9732169, "headline": "It\u2019s Not an Important Affair as Women Hijack Men\u2019s Day", "datePublished": "2021-11-21T10:13:29+00:00", "datePublishedRaw": "2021-11-21T10:13:29+00:00", "dateModified": "2021-11-21T10:14:22+00:00", "dateModifiedRaw": "2021-11-21T10:14:22+00:00", "author": "litfeed", "authorsList": ["litfeed"], "inLanguage": "en", "breadcrumbs": [{"name": "Home", "link": "https://litkenya.com/"}, {"name": "Opinion", "link": "https://litkenya.com/opinion/"}, {"name": "It\u2019s Not an Important Affair as Women Hijack Men\u2019s Day"}], "mainImage": "https://litkenya.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/International-Mens-Day-_copy_1200x676.jpg", "description": "LitKenya.com aims to delight our consumers through original, relevant, concise and engaging content.", "articleBody": "AN ODE TO THE BOY CHILD, AND THE MAN\n\nLast Friday was International Men\u2019s Day.

This is because my country was worth it then; and is worth it now.\n\nI bear the scars of liberation with pride and embrace the blood, sweat and tears they cost me.\nBy the way, the tears from the torture chambers are still running, as you can tell from the handkerchief that never leaves my hand!\n\nFor years, I was not allowed to speak with other inmates. In fact, for six years straight, I did not sleep on a bed. For months on end, I was either held incommunicado, in solitary confinement, or handcuffed and in transit to the next prison or detention camp. Relatives died, including my beloved mother and my own brother, and I never got the chance to say goodbye.\n\nI would not wish this torment upon anyone, not even my worst enemy. Together with my comrades who endured torture and survived those dark days of despair, we would never let Kenya degenerate down the road of terror. But there was a positive side to my story. It is about a friend. A \u2018Lando\u2019 of legendary beauty, with the brave heart of Luanda Magere.\n\nAnd this is the woman who stood by me when I was shunned by many. This is the wife of my youth, love of my life and partner to death \u2013 Mama Ida Betty Odinga.\n\nIn those hard times of long and uncertain incarceration, if I was not reading the Holy Bible, I found deep solace in Mama Ida\u2019s love and support. She became a constant guest of the police cells through constant arrests and harassments. I can\u2019t thank her enough.\n\nFellow citizens,\n\nWhat makes a great nation is not the men it produces, but the men it honors. That\u2019s why I would be remiss if I do not pay homage to those that gave us the sacred license to stand tall, to speak freely and to think big on this very day.\n\nAnd here I am talking about my comrades in arms, both alive and those who have fallen.\n\nI pay homage to those who have gone before us, the fallen heroes of the second liberation.\n\nThese include Kenneth Matiba and Charles Rubia. Many do not recall that I was detained at Kamiti Maximum Prison on the same day with two compatriots on the 5th of July 1990 for demanding multi-partysm.\n\nOther fallen compatriots include George Anyona, Jean Marie Seroney, Martin Shikuku, Mukaru Ng\u2019ang\u2019a, Oki Ooko Ombaka and Wangari Maathai.\n\nI also pay homage to all the audacious martyrs who, for the sake of the people, chose constant crucifixion over the relative comfort of conceding to repression.\n\nI hold the deepest respect for living icons like Mukami waKimathi, wife of Dedan Kimathi.\n\nThey called her \u2018The Wasp\u2019 because, like Kimathi, her husband, Mukami was a fearless General, who mobilized daring bands of women in complex undercover Mau Mau operations. I salute her.\n\nOther liberators include Ngugi Wa Thiongo, whose powerful written work enriched the ideologies of the struggle against the one party regime; Koigi wa Wamwere whose fearless voice inspired many to action.\n\nI remember Dr Odhiambo Mbai, the fearless chair of the Devolution committee at the Bomas conference who was brutally assassinated, and Dr Willy Mutunga who distinguished himself as a selfless champion of Social Justice and a comrade in the detention chambers. In the course of this struggle, there have been ups and downs, advances and retreats, but we have never lost our direction.\n\nAt this point, I must pay homage to my brother His Excellency President Uhuru Kenyatta for the foresight and sense of patriotism in initiating the dialogue that led to the handshake. It takes a seasoned statesman to shake the hand of his rival. I thank him. In the course of our discussions, we agreed that Kenya is greater than the two of us. We agreed that despite years of effort, Project Kenya has not quite taken off the way our founders envisaged.\n\nWhere our founders envisaged unity, we have been held back by divisions; tribe against tribe, region against region, men against women, leader against leader. As if these divisions have not been costly enough, there are still massive efforts by some to divide us further, as rich and poor, young and old. We agreed that where our fathers dreamt of plenty within our borders, poverty has taken deep roots in our land. We agreed that we must deal a deadly blow to corruption before it brings down our country.\n\nWe resolved to work together to unite our people in order to realize the Kenyan Dream as coined by the Founding Fathers: \u201cJustice be our shield and defender, may we dwell in unity, peace and liberty, plenty be found within our borders.\u201d That is the foundation of the Azimio La Umoja.\n\nI must add here that, with this reconciliation, I asked for nothing, and I will never ask for anything except the opportunity to serve. Peace making is not a self-enriching enterprise. It is a calling from God. Blessed are the peace-makers for they shall be called the children of God.\n\nFellow Countrymen;\n\nLet me shift gears now to other stories, those that I witnessed, listened to and collected on my Azimio La Umoja tour of every corner of our great republic over the last three months. This meeting today is the culmination of the Azimio la Umoja journeys we have taken together.\n\nKenyans spoke from their hearts during the 15 Azimio la Umoja mammoth meetings. At the Coast, wananchi reminded me that land issues remain a subject of pain.\n\nMany families long for the privilege of possessing \u2018family land\u2019 that they can pass down generations. They cried about the huge impact of the Standard Gauge Railway on their businesses.\n\nWe travelled into the North Rift and there, I listened to concerns of residents whose livelihoods are being destroyed by cartels in agriculture; people who import maize while farmers are stuck with maize.\n\nThey lamented the collapse of dairy and tea sectors and the high cost of farm inputs. The communities of West Pokot County wondered why there was a West Pokot when there is no East Pokot! They asked to be identified specifically as a community in the national census with their own development projects, and the creation of two more constituencies and five wards. I have also spent time in Mount Kenya, both West and East. And I can confirm to this congregation that if the mountain was smooth, it would be impossible to climb it. The mountain has to be bumpy for you to scale it.\n\nOn this, I am happy to note that I have reached very close to the peak. I have seen the Batian and Lenana peaks, and the people have promised that we shall walk together to the promised land yonder, if I prove that I understand and shall address their concerns.\n\nResidents expressed concerns about the equitable distribution of development resources within the region and proportional representation. They summarized it in the call for \u2013 One man, One shilling, One Vote. And they want to earn more from their tea, coffee, pyrethrum, vegetables, potatoes and dairy.\n\nNyanza complained about non-functioning and collapsed cotton, sugarcane, fishing, tobacco, tea, and soapstone industries and the denial of economic opportunities for the region. In Turkana the continuing challenge of general insecurity, poverty, drought and famine were raised repeatedly.\n\nIn Lower Eastern, the local communities complained of a serious lack of water, recurring famine and a lack of economic opportunities.\n\nNorthern Kenya felt profoundly let down by Nairobi. Their children are being denied identity cards by their own country. Education is collapsing due to insecurity and the livestock sector is severely threatened by drought and disease. I took note that while our people of Mt Kenya spoke of One Man, One Vote, One Shilling, northern Kenya spoke of One Man, One Kilometre, One Shilling. Indeed, Kenya is diverse in its needs and in ideas to address the needs. In Western Kenya, I was repeatedly reminded of local industries like sugar that had been allowed to collapse due to corruption, neglect and mismanagement.\n\nFisheries and mining are struggling. Young men and women who would have gained from local thriving industries spoke of how they are forced to migrate from home to seek opportunity. The Maa nation is worried about lack of livestock and pastoralist economy. They worry about the environmental degradation upstream which impacts them directly. They have their historical injustices over land.\n\nThese are just some of the concerns that I noted, internalised and took on as a personal mission.\n\nListening to our people made me look back over the last five decades. It became crystal clear that while much has been achieved, much remains to be done. I stand here, deeply concerned, indeed horrified, at how our peers at independence left us far behind.\n\nNations like South Korea, Malaysia and Singapore with whom we were at the same level of development in 1964 have largely vanquished extreme poverty. Their education systems have dealt a deadly blow to the ignorance and put them in the premier league of the Fourth Industrial Revolution. We have to change tact. We have to catch up.\n\nThis is the Azimio La Umoja we have gathered here today to proclaim and uphold in our third liberation for an economic revolution in our nation.\n\nThe first liberation brought us independence in 1963. The second liberation brought us the people-driven constitution of 2010. The Third Liberation is for the economic revolution in our nation that must see us emerge as a modern and industrial nation that will consign poverty, ignorance and disease to the dustbin of forgettable history. It must put us in the driving seat of the Fourth Industrial Revolution in Africa.\n\nFellow Kenyans,\n\nFollowing the listening tours, and to address the concerns that emerged, we came up with a Ten-Point People\u2019s Programmes as follows:\n\nPoint Number One: Inua Jamii, Pesa Mfukoni. A nation\u2019s greatness is judged by how it treats its poor and vulnerable. Pesa Mfukoni is a social protection programme that will deliver Ksh6, 000 per month to two million of the country\u2019s most needy families.\n\nIt is not a handout but an investment and a foundation for a new transformational value chain that will also trigger massive economic activity and create thousands of localized small scale businesses and enterprises across the country.\n\nThis will lead to millions of jobs and the eventual development of a thriving middle class.\n\nThe resulting middle class and SMEs will be a robust market for larger, more national corporations.\n\nPoint Number Two: \u2018BabaCare\u2019. Each of us has experienced the all-consuming strain that accompanies the ill-health of a family member. We know that Health related calamities do not ask who you voted for! And because Health care is a constitutional right, BabaCare will scale up the Universal Health Care pilot programmes to the rest of the country.\n\nWe want a Kenya where no one will ever have to wonder if they can afford to save their child\u2019slife, get treatment for their ailing grandparents or manage a chronic disease.\n\nPoint Number Three: Kazi Kwa Wote. This is about securing the welfare of the people by generating avenues for productivity, through job creation programs, investing in the critical jua kali sector and other macro and micro economic stimulation schemes.\n\nPoint Number Four: Uchumi Kwa Akina Mama. This will focus on the true multipliers of wealth in our community; our women. The programme will unlock access to financing for women-led businesses and provide support for women on other enabling factors such as access to assets for production, land tenure and proportional representation in all Government levels.\n\nPoint Number Five: \u201cHashtag Inawezekana.\u201d We know that our youth are closer to the future than we are. But they are exploited as cannon fodder for bad politics. Now more than ever, we need to invest in preparing our youth for that future.\n\nThe program will equip our youth with the mindset, skills, funds and technology to enable them innovate at par, and even surpass their global counterparts.\n\nPoint Number Six: \u201cWaste not a Single Child\u201d Education is a non-negotiable. This programme will be an aggressive scheme to ensure that all, not some of our children, get a rightful access to quality education. We will deploy a new army of teachers to deliver to our children.\n\nFor northern Kenya, we will pursue a special affirmative action program in admitting students from ASAL into Teacher Training Institutions and universities to create a local, committed workforce to serve as teachers and education officers in the region. A multi-agency engine will drive the process to ensure no young Kenyan is locked out, for any reason whatsoever.\n\nPoint Number Seven: Fukuza Njaa. The aim here is not to merely feed, but to generate the agricultural bounty that Kenya has the potential to produce. We will factor in Climate Change adaptation and mitigation to support and help realize high agricultural productivity across the nation.\n\nPoint Number Eight: Maji Kwa Kila Boma. The program will radically reverse the artificial shortages and high cost of water, particularly for the poor.\n\nWe shall not allow water scarcity to be an issue in a country like ours where lakes and rivers burst their banks, yet desert nations have found ways to direct every drop to its people for consumption and production. Water must and will be the least of every Kenyan household\u2019s worry.\n\nPoint Number Nine: One County, One Product. I firmly believe that the idea of devolution in Kenya has the transformative potential of rich mineral mines, abundant oilfields and other traditional markers of a nation\u2019s affluence.\n\n\u201cOne County, One Product\u201d programme is designed to be a launch pad to a Kenya which consumes its products, exports excesses and registers surpluses, not deficits.\n\nThe National Government will support materially and technically towards an ultimate vision where 47 vibrant counties begin industrializing at unstoppable rates.\n\nThe tenth pillar of my Vision, has to do with The Principle of Administrative Continuity. By continuity, I mean building and improving on the gains that have been made by the administrations that came before.\n\nAfrica suffers from a retrogressive mindset of starting afresh, instead of advancing existing accomplishments. When one administration sets something up, the next knocks it down. This makes many countries in the continent stuck in a constant state of ignition, never making it to acceleration and takeoff.\n\nKenya must not be a \u2018start-stop\u2019 nation. This is a waste of time and resources that should not be entrenched in Kenyan political culture. For example, President Kenyatta\u2019s Linda Mama programme could not have worked without the construction of health facilities and upgrading of transport networks that we undertook during the Grand Coalition Government.\n\nThe plans for the Rapid Bus and Transit System could not have been operationalized without the construction of Thika and Mbagathi Roads.\n\nThe plan the Lamu Port dates back to 1972 when President Mwai Kibaki was finance minister. It took almost 50 years for it to be launched by Kibaki as President in 2012 as he was leaving office. President Uhuru Kenyatta took it up in 2013, ran with it and has implemented it in eight years. The Lamu Project is one whose ultimate vision I see clearly.\n\nIgnoring it squanders the opportunity, by another 50 years, to have a world-class trans-shipment hub that will reap exponential economic benefits for our country.\n\nMy manifesto will bear a crystallized description of the Ten Point Peoples\u2019 Programme, delving into the workings and plans that will actualize it for the People. These are just but highlights of new programs that we shall roll out to respond to needs expressed at Azimio la Umoja events. Very soon, I will unveil a detailed manifesto addressing other critical concerns like corruption, public debt, industrialization , digital economy and promotion and protection of businesses and, particularly, protection of private property. Our business community deserve protection and they will get it.\n\nFellow citizens,\n\nAt the top of our national government where leadership is exercised to the maximum in governing and changing our nation is the precidency.\n\nA president makes a difference in the life of this nation. Having listened to your calls during our conventions, given my credentials to this congregation and the nation at large; and having spelt out the peoples\u2019 aspirations as I understand them under Azimio La Umoja; and having given my 10-point vision for Kenya:\n\nOn this 10th day of December, 2021, I Raila Amolo Odinga, having been faithful and committed to building a national, democratic and progressive Kenya in our lifetime, having worked with many patriotic Kenyans to achieve this goal,\n\nI do hereby accept to present myself as a presidential can at the Presidential Election on 9th of August 2022 following the request and unanimous decision by this Azimio La Umoja.\n\nI am not running for president to oppose anyone but to propose better policies. I am in this race to mold one indivisible nation. I am not at war with personalities, I am at war with ideologies that would lead this nation in the wrong direction.\n\nIdeologies that divide us instead of uniting us. Ideologies that put the personal above the national good. To put our country on the path of lasting unity, stability and prosperity, I hereby announce the launch of a movement anchored on the pillars of Utu, Undugu, Umoja, Usawa na Usalizaji (humility, brotherliness, unity, equality and productivity)-Azimio La Umoja Movement.", "articleBodyHtml": "<article>\n\n<p>Distinguished Guests,<br>Ladies and Gentlemen,<br>Fellow countrymen,<br>Good Afternoon.</p>\n\n<p>I stand here before you today, a proud son of Kenya, a liberation fighter and servant of the people for the last 50 years.

The Lamu Project is one whose ultimate vision I see clearly.</p>\n\n<p>Ignoring it squanders the opportunity, by another 50 years, to have a world-class trans-shipment hub that will reap exponential economic benefits for our country.</p>\n\n<p>My manifesto will bear a crystallized description of the Ten Point Peoples\u2019 Programme, delving into the workings and plans that will actualize it for the People. These are just but highlights of new programs that we shall roll out to respond to needs expressed at Azimio la Umoja events. Very soon, I will unveil a detailed manifesto addressing other critical concerns like corruption, public debt, industrialization , digital economy and promotion and protection of businesses and, particularly, protection of private property. Our business community deserve protection and they will get it.</p>\n\n<p>Fellow citizens,</p>\n\n<p>At the top of our national government where leadership is exercised to the maximum in governing and changing our nation is the precidency.</p>\n\n<p>A president makes a difference in the life of this nation. Having listened to your calls during our conventions, given my credentials to this congregation and the nation at large; and having spelt out the peoples\u2019 aspirations as I understand them under Azimio La Umoja; and having given my 10-point vision for Kenya:</p>\n\n<p>On this 10th day of December, 2021, I Raila Amolo Odinga, having been faithful and committed to building a national, democratic and progressive Kenya in our lifetime, having worked with many patriotic Kenyans to achieve this goal,</p>\n\n<p>I do hereby accept to present myself as a presidential can at the Presidential Election on 9th of August 2022 following the request and unanimous decision by this Azimio La Umoja.</p>\n\n<p>I am not running for president to oppose anyone but to propose better policies. I am in this race to mold one indivisible nation. I am not at war with personalities, I am at war with ideologies that would lead this nation in the wrong direction.</p>\n\n<p>Ideologies that divide us instead of uniting us. Ideologies that put the personal above the national good. To put our country on the path of lasting unity, stability and prosperity, I hereby announce the launch of a movement anchored on the pillars of Utu, Undugu, Umoja, Usawa na Usalizaji (humility, brotherliness, unity, equality and productivity)-Azimio La Umoja Movement.</p>\n\n</article>", "canonicalUrl": "https://litkenya.com/railas-full-azimio-la-umoja-national-convention-statement/"}]
