of 2020.\n\nAccording to the latest statistical report by the Kenya National Bureau of Statistics (KNBS), Kenya\u2019s economic growth declined to 0.7% in Q1, 2021 compared to 4.4% in Q1, 2020, mainly as a result of the effects of the pandemic on the economy.\n\nDuring the second quarter of 2021, the country\u2019s accelerated growth rate was driven by rebounds in most economic activities from significant contractions in Q2, 2020. The growth was also as a result of the easing of COVID-19 containment measures that facilitated the gradual resumption of economic activity.\n\nSome of the sectors that supported overall growth in Kenya\u2019s economy in the second quarter included Manufacturing (9.6%), Education (67.6%), Transportation and Storage (16.9%), Information and Communication (25.2%) and Other Services Activities (20.2%).\n\nGDP Sectoral Analysis\n\nAgricultural Sector\nThere was a slowdown in performance of Kenya\u2019s agriculture, forestry and fishing activities in the first and second quarters of 2021.

It works as either a token- or account-based solution.\n\nThe token-based CBDCs resemble cash. Citizens have digital wallets that hold digital cash and when they make a transaction, the amount of cash in the wallet reduces accordingly. The tokens in the wallet represent the value of the money, and the key concern is to ensure the validity of each token.\n\nOn the other hand, account-based CBDCs work like digital bank accounts, but the accounts are held by the central bank rather than a commercial bank. The value is equivalent to the balance of the account, and the key concern is identification, which will correctly link payers and payees, and check that the payer has sufficient funds to make the transaction.\n\nWhat are central banks around the world doing? The Case of Ghana and Nigeria\n\nWith over 16 speakers and 2 hours of content, several themes emerged on the future of CBDCs and Cryptocurrency.\n\nEarlier this week, we reported that Nigeria and Ghana are set to adopt central bank digital currencies, after Central banks in both countries partnered with foreign financial tech companies to create digital versions of their currencies.\n\nThe Bank of Ghana is partnering with German firm Giesecke+Devrient (G+D) to pilot the e-Cedi. The CEO of G+D Ralf Wintergerst, while speaking at the forum, noted that (G+D) will provide the technology that will be tested in a trial phase with local banks, payment service providers, consumers and others.\n\n\"CBDCs can play a wider role in the stabilization of currencies\" Ralf Wintergerst, Group CEO, Giesecke+Devrient pic.twitter.com/ci8700tV9Q\n\n\u2014 Kenyan Wallstreet (@kenyanwalstreet) September 28, 2021\n\nOn the other hand, Nigeria selected global financial technology company Bitt Inc. for its Central Bank Digital Currencies (CBDC) launch known as \u201cE-Naira\u201d after more than three years of research into the digital currency. Nigeria will launch its eNaira on 1st October 2021, while Ghana will trial e-Cedi from this month.\n\nIt also emerged that China has leapfrogged much of the developed world in its establishment of digital yuan.

It works as either a token- or account-based solution.</p>\n\n<p>The token-based CBDCs resemble cash. Citizens have digital wallets that hold digital cash and when they make a transaction, the amount of cash in the wallet reduces accordingly. The tokens in the wallet represent the value of the money, and the key concern is to ensure the validity of each token.</p>\n\n<p>On the other hand, account-based CBDCs work like digital bank accounts, but\u00a0 the accounts are held by the central bank rather than a commercial bank. The value is equivalent to the balance of the account, and the key concern is identification, which will correctly link payers and payees, and check that the payer has sufficient funds to make the transaction.</p>\n\n<h2><strong>What are central banks around the world doing? The Case of Ghana and Nigeria</strong></h2>\n\n<p>With over 16 speakers and 2 hours of content, several themes emerged on the future of CBDCs and Cryptocurrency.</p>\n\n<p>Earlier this week,<a href=\"https://kenyanwallstreet.com/nigeria-ghana-central-bank-digital-currencies/\"> we reported</a> that Nigeria and Ghana are set to adopt central bank digital currencies, after Central banks in both countries partnered with foreign financial tech companies to create digital versions of their currencies.</p>\n\n<p>The Bank of Ghana is partnering with German firm Giesecke+Devrient (G+D) to pilot the e-Cedi. The CEO of G+D Ralf Wintergerst, while speaking at the forum, noted that (G+D) will provide the technology that will be tested in a trial phase with local banks, payment service providers, consumers and others.</p>\n\n<figure><blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\" data-width=\"500\" data-dnt=\"true\"><p lang=\"en\" dir=\"ltr\">\"CBDCs can play a wider role in the stabilization of currencies\" Ralf Wintergerst, Group CEO, Giesecke+Devrient <a href=\"https://t.co/ci8700tV9Q\" target=\"_blank\">pic.twitter.com/ci8700tV9Q</a></p>\u2014 Kenyan Wallstreet (@kenyanwalstreet) <a href=\"https://twitter.com/kenyanwalstreet/status/1442873922500759557?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">September 28, 2021</a></blockquote></figure>\n\n<p>On the other hand, Nigeria selected global financial technology company Bitt Inc. for its Central Bank Digital Currencies (CBDC) launch known as<a href=\"https://enaira.com/\"> \u201cE-Naira\u201d</a> after more than three years of research into the digital currency. Nigeria will launch its eNaira on 1st October 2021, while Ghana will trial e-Cedi from this month.</p>\n\n<p>It also emerged that China has leapfrogged much of the developed world in its establishment of digital yuan.

We tackled different issues, including how how sustainable investments present a great opportunity for companies and governments alike to tackle Africa\u2019s energy challenges.\n\nHaving worked extensively in the US and the UK, Elsie Mbugua believes that the African energy industry is still at a very nascent stage, perhaps 10-15 years behind the other markets like Europe or the US. Therefore, it is paramount that we promote sustainable investments and get the right mix of policies that work for our specific countries and industries to spur growth.\n\nWe are still in the process of laying the frameworks; establishing the right policies to drive the strategic energy efforts across the continent. So, I think having been an energy trader in mature markets is almost like having a crystal ball to see what our energy markets could potentially look like 10 \u2013 15 years from now.\n\nElsie Mbugua \u2013 Founder and Managing Director, Leadwood Energy on Africa\u2019s energy scene\n\nOil & Gas\n\nFollowing the demand disruption of oil and gas supply chains last year due to the pandemic, we have seen some recoveries. However, Elsie Mbugua notes that East Africa is still a price-taker in the oil market due to its reliance on the importation of its petroleum products and low consumption volumes relative to global demand. Even though we discovered oil deposits many years ago in Turkana, we haven\u2019t reached commercialising it, and although there is progress, it could take quite some time before it is fully realized.\n\nWith regard to infrastructure developments, Tanzania-Kenya gas pipeline, Elsie Mbugua explains that it usually takes time between MoU signing and actual groundbreaking of the project. Therefore there is a need for a lot of patience to realise these infrastructure benefits.\n\n\u201cBy the time you move from a memorandum of understanding to when you break ground on a pipeline, a lot of work needs to be done\u2026.one is managing the expectations of how quickly that could potentially come on and recognising that that\u2019s years as well\u2026\u201d\n\nElsie Mbugua on the recent MoU of a gas pipeline between Kenya and Tanzania\n\nRenewable Energy\n\nEast Africa has been a significant destination for renewable energy capital investments in recent times, with Kenya ranking third overall across Middle East and Africa. Now, there is a global urgency towards decarbonisation and getting to a net-zero world; we see a dramatic increase in renewable energy investments as more governments and the private sector align with climate change. Africa contributes 2% of global emissions but is disproportionately affected by climate change; the African Development Bank estimates that climate change already costs the continent between $7bn and $15bn. Therefore, there\u2019s an obvious need to shift towards more cleaner energy sources.\n\nElsie is quick to applaud the Kenya Generating Company (KenGen) on the incredible efforts made to advance our geothermal energy capacity and the neighbouring countries by way of sharing technical expertise. KenGen has just recently announced that they are commencing drilling of the Djibouti power project in June 2021.\n\nGeothermal power has much potential in East Africa. Kenya, however, has the greatest, with an estimated 10GW geothermal potential and currently only generates about 1000MW, only a tenth of what is possible, from geothermal sources.\n\nEnvironmental, Social & Corporate Governance (ESG)\n\nElsie Mbugua opines that environmental, social and corporate governance is no longer a nice-to-have metric on financial reports but rather something that investors and shareholders are demanding for. Therefore, African companies must adopt ESG principles within their operations and strategies, if they are to be sustainable.\n\nElsie Mbugua on Innovations to Watch Out For\n\nWhen it comes to innovation, startups as well as established companies are pushing the envelope of what is possible. Elsie personally picks the following as the most exciting areas to watch out for in the energy space\n\nAdvisors that bridge the gap between public and private entities encouraging a harmonised voice across the energy sector\nSmart Meters \u2013 To ensure and enhance operational capability and effective revenue collection.\nCost reflective tariffs \u2013 whereby it reflects the actual cost of supplying electricity and removes the reliance on State and/or Government subsidies to cover the variance between the current tariff and the true cost of electricity supply.\nOptimisation of the energy generation mix \u2013 due to its intermittency; eliant upon hydro, wind or solar is inherently unreliable for industrialization; however, natural gas generation options can be a substitute for baseload power generation and a bridge for even more renewable energy. There are companies we support that are seriously evaluating gas conversion for their power plants from heavy fuel oil to cleaner natural gas. The conversion will support the growth of our industrial customer base and associated energy consumption in key load centers.\nPower Storage \u2013 one of the biggest drawbacks to renewable energy adoption is the lack of storage capacity, especially since batteries for storing this energy are still relatively expensive at scale. They store the energy for relatively shorter periods. However, we are currently seeing companies innovating around making batteries that can store this energy for longer periods of time, accelerating the adoption of renewable energy.\nGas conversion of existing thermal power plants \u2013 most of Kenya\u2019s power plants are quite old and mostly sit at the load centres where most customers are, making them critical.\nSmart Meters \u2013 To ensure and enhance operational capabilities and strengthen revenue collection. And, Pay as you Go, providers \u2013 those companies that have increasingly leveraged mobile payment technology to drive the uptake of energy solutions like MKopa, dLight e.t.c\nMini-Grids \u2013 companies that are innovating around providing access to the rural population through mini-grids. According to the World Bank, Mini-grids are electric power generation and distribution systems that can provide electricity to either customers in a remote settlement or bring power to hundreds of thousands of customers in a town or city. They can be fully isolated from the primary grid or connected to it but able to intentionally isolate (\u201cisland\u201d) themselves from the grid.\nData Analytics \u2013 companies harnessing data will allow for better energy policy making and more strategic investments. This will greatly benefit the energy and investment ecosystem at large.\n\nListen to the full podcast interview below or download the Hisa App on Android or iOS to listen to this and more podcasts.\n\n**Note** In the podcast, Elsie Mbugua mentions that Kenyas\u2019 Geothermal potential is estimated to be 100GW. We have corrected the article above to reflect the correct potential, which is 10GW.\n\nAbout Elsie Mbugua\n\nElsie Mbugua is the Founder of Elcy Investments Ltd with its power subsidiary Leadwood Energy; a specialist energy advisory company focused on renewable energy projects. She is also one of the financial transaction advisors to the Government of Kenya on the country\u2019s crude oil and natural gas prospects and is considered a thought leader and a key policy maker in East Africa\u2019s energy markets. She is well known for working on what she terms as \u2018first of a kind\u2019 energy transactions in the region. She has been involved in restructuring various parastatals in the country through Financial Independent Business Reviews, developing the framework for a local currency Power Purchase Agreement, negotiating the Heads of Terms for Kenya\u2019s Upstream Crude Project.\n\nShe was voted 2019 Young Emerging Energy Leader and also received an award recognition for her exceptional leadership in Africa\u2019s energy sector. In 2020, her Firm was voted Best Renewable Energy Consulting Firm in East Africa and also won the East Africa Green Future Leadership Award. Her thoughts on Africa\u2019s energy transformation are widely published in numerous energy journals.\n\nElsie Mbugua is also an entrepreneur and energy trader with more than a decade of experience as a physical energy trader for some of the world\u2019s largest trading houses \u2013 Goldman Sachs and J.P Morgan \u2013 covering markets in coal, emissions, power, natural gas, liquefied natural gas, and crude oil.\n\nShe started her career in New York at Goldman Sachs on the J. Aron energy trading desk, where she performed extensive research on Canadian Oil Sands and Refinery Hedging. She later joined J.P Morgan\u2019s Global Commodities Division as a coal and emissions trader and participated in the first market-based effort to reduce greenhouse gas emissions (RGGI). In 2009 during, the global financial crisis, Elsie moved to Houston to assist in the management and optimization of 3000 MW of power generating assets in California. In this role, she collaborated with colleagues to build structural and in depth technical analyses of North America\u2019s power markets.\n\nIn 2012, Elsie relocated to London in order to be more involved in Africa based markets and worked as a physical crude oil trader covering the dated Brent and West African crude oil markets. She was one of the youngest physical oil traders in London.\n\nFurthermore, Elsie Mbugua was recently appointed to the Board of State Corporation Kenya Pipeline Company and made the Chair of the Technical Committee. She is the founder of a US 501c3 called Ekenywa which builds water infrastructure projects with the goal of ensuring all rural public schools in Kenya have access to clean water. So far, more than 50,000 Kenyans rely on this infrastructure for their daily access to clean water. She also sits on the United States Board of BOMA which is a multi-million USD organization committed to advancing the livelihood of women entrepreneurs in Eastern Africa.", "articleBodyHtml": "<article>\n\n<p><br> <iframe src=\"https://anchor.fm/kenyanwallstreet/embed/episodes/Elsie-Mbugua-on-Boosting-Sustainable-Investments-in-the-Energy-Sector-e119mob/a-a5knl84\"></iframe></p>\n\n<p>We recently caught up with Elsie Mbugua to discuss the African Energy industry.

This section allows you to change/remove your profile picture, change your M-PESA pin, disable or enable biometric authentication and offline mode. It also gives you access to the Safaricom website, their social networks, and call suport.\n\nSumming Up\n\nOne may be tempted to see this as a replica of the initial My Safaricom app, because the latter also has all the aforementioned options, alongside others such as Data & Calls plans, Tunukiwa offers and Home Fibre. Apart from the Discover Tab, every other thing on the M-PESA App is identical to the My Safaricom App. The Discover Tab on My Safaricom App allows you to buy and read your favourite newspaper online.", "articleBodyHtml": "<article>\n\n<p><br></p>\n\n<p>Safaricom has launched its new M-PESA app, seeking to provide users with a seamless way to handle their daily transactions.

The five main areas of the app are:</p>\n\n<p><strong>Home </strong>\u2013 Here, users can view their M-PESA balance, see a summary of their spend, \u00a0access a scrollable list of their statements and also perform the most popular M- \u00a0PESA transactions (send money, lipa na M-PESA, withdraw and buy airtime). This information is available to anyone with your M-PESA pin. However, there is an \u2018eye\u2019 button just next to your M-PESA balance. You can click it to hide transaction details, and click it again to view them.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Transact </strong>\u2013 Here users will see all the M-PESA products and services available. However, this looks like a redundant tab to the Home tab, seeing that all the things in here, can be accessed also via the Home tab. The only unique feature of this tab is the Fuliza option. If you are already opted in Fuliza, clicking this button will display your Fuliza limit, and outstanding debt, if any. It also automatically sends a Fuliza mini statement to your sim messages.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Discover </strong>\u2013 From the discover tab, customers will be able to access all the approved \u00a03<sup>rd </sup>party mini apps such as SGR booking, Pro Gas, Buu Pass, etc.</p>\n\n<p><strong>My Spend </strong>\u2013 Users will be able to view their monthly spending on M-PESA as a total \u00a0as well as broken down per spending categories i.e. food and beverage, transport, \u00a0etc.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Grow </strong>\u2013 Access all products that assist in investing your money as well as providing credit i.e. M-Shwari.</p>\n\n<figure><a href=\"https://i2.wp.com/kenyanwallstreet.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/image-2.png?ssl=1\"><img src=\"https://i2.wp.com/kenyanwallstreet.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/image-2.png?resize=204%2C443&amp;ssl=1\" alt=\"\" srcset=\"https://i2.wp.com/kenyanwallstreet.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/image-2.png?w=204&amp;ssl=1 204w, https://i2.wp.com/kenyanwallstreet.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/image-2.png?resize=138%2C300&amp;ssl=1 138w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 204px) 100vw, 204px\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\"></a><figcaption>M-PESA App Navigation</figcaption></figure>\n\n<h2><strong>M-PESA App Homescreen</strong></h2>\n\n<p>The Home screen is the page where you\u2019ll land after each log-in; it can also \u00a0be accessed through the tab at the bottom left navigation bar.

We give you a step by step guide to build an investment plan that aligns to your goals!\n\nHow Investment Scams Trip Us Up\n\nFraudsters tend to be eloquent and well enlightened about financial matters and you can barely suspect them.

Using convincing words, the fraudsters will make you believe the investment will bring excellent returns with little to no risks.\n\n3 Most Common Investment Scams\n\nInvestment fraud is becoming quite common, making it challenging to distinguish genuine investment opportunities from scams. Below are some of the common types of investment scams that you are likely to come across as an investor:\n\nPyramid Schemes\n\nA pyramid scheme is a fraudulent system in which investors are meant to make money by recruiting other investors, who are also expected to recruit more investors, and the cycle continues endlessly. Many people confuse pyramid schemes for legitimate multi-level companies. Well, the difference between the two is subtle; a pyramid scheme is set up to collect funds from unsuspecting investors and there is no real underlying business ( they\u2019re destined to fail) while a legitimate multi-level marketing (MLM) company has a legitimate business that uses the MLM structure as a sales strategy.\n\nPyramid schemes may or may not involve the sale of products. However, some of them could incorporate the sale of products or distributorships in an attempt to make the investment look legitimate.\n\nHow do you identify a pyramid scheme and avoid losing your money? Here are the warning signs:\n\nRecruiting more investors is more important than selling products\nInvestors have to pay a fee before they can start selling the company\u2019s products or recruiting other investors\nThe products to be sold are difficult to sell.\n\n2. Ponzi Schemes\n\nPonzi schemes are investment scams that rely on new investors\u2019 funds to pay existing investors. The fraudsters promise to invest their funds in opportunities such as FOREX, Cryptocurrency, Real Estate, and so on and repay it in a relatively short period with little to no risks. However, most of these predators don\u2019t invest your money. Instead, they use it to pay existing investors and keep the rest to themselves.\n\nPonzi schemes require the constant recruitment of investors to survive. Ponzi schemes will collapse as soon as the fraudsters cannot attract new investors. The schemes also collapse if a large number of existing investors cash out.\n\nHere is what you need to watch out for:\n\nGuaranteed investment opportunity with very high returns but little to no risks involved\nOverly positive returns that are regularly consistent regardless of the overall market fluctuations\nInvestments that are not registered with state regulators\nScanty information about the founders and directors\nComplicated investments that that are difficult to understand\nAccount statement errors. This could be a sign that your money was not invested as promised\nDifficulties in cashing out\n\n2. Pump and Dump Schemes\n\nThese schemes are manipulative, and not so easy to suspect. Scammers buy low-priced shares from a small thinly-traded company listed on a stock exchange, with low liquidity. They then spread false, exaggerated, or misleading information regarding the shares to increase their stock price. Unsuspecting investors get excited and believe the stock has promising prospects, and then rush to buy causing an increasing demand, and the stock price rises.\n\nOnce this happens, the fraudsters sell their shares at very prices and vanish while the stock price drops suddenly due to lack of demand.\n\nWarning signs of a pump and dump scheme include:\n\nReceiving unsolicited emails about a particular stock\nSkyrocketing prices of certain stocks without clear reasons such as improvement in earnings, issuance of dividends, or other material information;\nA sudden increase in the volume of the stock when it has previously been thinly traded; or\nStocks are being promoted highly on social media and online messaging boards on popular portals that discuss investing in the stock market.\n\nHow to Protect Yourself\n\nAsk questions\n\nNot expecting you to investigate, fraudsters are put off when you dig deep without relying on their information and references. Some questions you can ask are:\n\nHow do you make money?\nCan I see your audited accounts for the last 3 years?\nWho is on your board?\nHow are you able to generate such consistent returns in a turbulent market?\n\nDo your own due diligence\n\nAvoid relying solely on the company\u2019s website, emails, and postings on internet forums. Seek to clearly understand the business and its products and services and stay away if the deal seems too good to be true. There will never be an investment with high returns and yet with no or very low risk.\n\nTake time to conduct a background check on the individual selling the investment. Are they licensed as a financial advisor, or do they have expertise and experience? Also check whether their firm has had serious disciplinary action taken by regulators. The Capital Markets Authority Kenya website would help with this.\n\nSpeak to an independent financial advisor that is not related to the deal and get their thoughts.\n\nOnly invest when you understand the investment opportunity and understand the risk you are taking.\n\nWe must invest. However, take time to make investment decisions that are aligned to your goals, and your circumstances, such as age, risk appetite, current income and assets, your family set up, knowledge and expertise, and so on.

Unsuspecting investors get excited and believe the stock has promising prospects, and then rush to buy causing an increasing demand, and the stock price rises.</p>\n\n<p>Once this happens, the fraudsters sell their shares at very prices and vanish while the stock price drops suddenly due to lack of demand.</p>\n\n<p>Warning signs of a pump and dump scheme include:</p>\n\n<ul><li>Receiving unsolicited emails about a particular stock</li><li>Skyrocketing prices of certain stocks without clear reasons such as improvement in earnings, issuance of dividends, or other material information;</li><li>A sudden increase in the volume of the stock when it has previously been thinly traded; or</li><li>Stocks are being promoted highly on social media and online messaging boards on popular portals that discuss investing in the stock market.</li></ul>\n\n<h2><strong>How to Protect Yourself\u00a0</strong></h2>\n\n<ul><li><strong>Ask questions</strong></li></ul>\n\n<p>Not expecting you to investigate, fraudsters are put off when you dig deep without relying on their information and references. Some questions you can ask are:</p>\n\n<ul><li>How do you make money?</li><li>Can I see your audited accounts for the last 3 years?</li><li>Who is on your board?</li><li>How are you able to generate such consistent returns in a turbulent market?</li></ul>\n\n<ul><li><strong>Do your own due diligence</strong></li></ul>\n\n<p>Avoid relying solely on the company\u2019s website, emails, and postings on internet forums. Seek to clearly understand the business and its products and services and stay away if the <strong>deal seems too good to be true</strong>. There will never be an investment with high returns and yet with no or very low risk.</p>\n\n<ul><li><strong>Take time to conduct a background check </strong>on the individual selling the investment. Are they licensed as a financial advisor, or do they have expertise and experience? Also check whether their firm has had serious disciplinary action taken by regulators. The Capital Markets Authority Kenya website would help with this.</li></ul>\n\n<ul><li>Speak to an independent financial advisor that is not related to the deal and get their thoughts.</li></ul>\n\n<ul><li>Only invest when you understand the investment opportunity and understand the risk you are taking.</li></ul>\n\n<p>We must invest. However, take time to make investment decisions that are aligned to your goals, and your circumstances, such as age, risk appetite, current income and assets, your family set up, knowledge and expertise, and so on.
