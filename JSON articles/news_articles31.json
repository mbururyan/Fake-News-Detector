Ladislaus Matindi, the Managing Director and CEO of Air Tanzania.\n\n\u201cWe at Air Tanzania are looking forward to bolstering the relations between Tanzania and Kenya, who have been trusted friends and sincere partners for decades, with this non-stop air service.\u201d\n\nAir Tanzania, Africa\u2019s newest fleet, will fly the Airbus A220-300, a 132-seater with 12 business class seats and 120 economy class seats.\n\nThe airline will depart Dar-es-Salaam at 5:30 a.m. to arrive in Nairobi at 6:45 a.m. and depart Nairobi at 7:45 a.m. to arrive in Dar at 9 a.m., at a cost of Ksh37,525 ($334) for a round trip and roughly Ksh23,594 ($210) for one way travel on the new Dar-Nairobi route. The evening flights will depart Julius Nyerere International Airport at 8 p.m. and arrive in Nairobi at 9:15 p.m., and Jomo Kenyatta International Airport at 10:15p.m. to arrive in Tanzania at 11:30 p.m.\n\n\u201cThis schedule has been created with the passenger\u2019s comfort in mind. For example, a Kenyan who needs to fly to Dar es Salaam for business can do so without incurring the added cost of an overnight stay. The person can fly out at 7:45 a.m., landing in Dar es Salaam at 9 a.m., then return to Nairobi at 9:15 p.m. on the same day. It also connects to the main flights into and out of Nairobi\u2019s JKIA airport, allowing travelers to connect quickly,\u201d added Eng. Matindi.\n\nApart from Nairobi, Air Tanzania has announced three new regional routes this month from Dar es Salaam to Bujumbura (Burundi), Ndola (Zambia), and Lubumbashi (DR Congo) as the country seeks to expand passenger services to new markets in Africa, Asia, and Europe as international borders reopen and travel restrictions ease. Mumbai (India), Hahaya (Comoros), Lusaka (Zambia), Harare (Zimbabwe), Entebbe (Uganda), and Guangzhou (China) are among the destinations served by Air Tanzania. It will add Johannesburg (South Africa), Lagos (Nigeria), Accra (Ghana), and London (United Kingdom) to its destinations in the coming months.\n\nAir Tanzania Company Limited (ATCL) presently has eleven new modernized aircraft in its fleet, with eight of them joining in the last three years including five Bombardiers Q400\u2019s, four Airbus A220-300\u2019s, and two Boeing 787-800 Dreamliners. ATCL has also made orders for additional six aircraft for Ksh73 billion ($726 million), including a Bombadier Q 400, two Boeing 737-900s, two Boeing 787-800 Dreamliners, and one Boeing 767 Freighter, all of which are due to enter the fleet within the next two years.\n\nAccording to figures from the Kenya National Bureau of Statistics, Tanzanian exports to Kenya increased to Ksh20.5 billion in the first half of the year, up from Ksh10.8 billion the previous year (KNBS). The value of Kenyan exports sent to Tanzania grew to Ksh17.8 billion from Ksh14 billion attributable to improved commercial links between the two neighboring countries.", "articleBodyHtml": "<article>\n\n<p>After a 20-plus year hiatus, Tanzania\u2019s national flag carrier, Air Tanzania, landed at Jomo Kenyatta International Airport (JKIA) on Friday, resuming daily flights between the two East African countries.</p>\n\n<p>The arrival of the Airbus A220-300 on Friday at 6:45 a.m. in Nairobi marks the start of the carrier\u2019s double-daily Dar es Salaam to Nairobi route.</p>\n\n<p>The company says the restart of this route has been prompted by improved bilateral relations, increased trade between the two countries, inter-governmental relations, tourism, extension of familial and friendly ties and the need to connect the region with other markets.</p>\n\n<p>\u201cWe are extremely delighted to resume Nairobi route, which is one of the most significant destinations in East Africa and a key aviation hub as well,\u201d said Eng. Ladislaus Matindi, the Managing Director and CEO of Air Tanzania.</p>\n\n<p>\u201cWe at Air Tanzania are looking forward to bolstering the relations between Tanzania and Kenya, who have been trusted friends and sincere partners for decades, with this non-stop air service.\u201d</p>\n\n<p>Air Tanzania, Africa\u2019s newest fleet, will fly the Airbus A220-300, a 132-seater with 12 business class seats and 120 economy class seats.</p>\n\n<p>The airline will depart Dar-es-Salaam at 5:30 a.m. to arrive in Nairobi at 6:45 a.m. and depart Nairobi at 7:45 a.m. to arrive in Dar at 9 a.m., at a cost of Ksh37,525 ($334) for a round trip and roughly Ksh23,594 ($210) for one way travel on the new Dar-Nairobi route. The evening flights will depart Julius Nyerere International Airport at 8 p.m. and arrive in Nairobi at 9:15 p.m., and Jomo Kenyatta International Airport at 10:15p.m. to arrive in Tanzania at 11:30 p.m.</p>\n\n<p>\u201cThis schedule has been created with the passenger\u2019s comfort in mind. For example, a Kenyan who needs to fly to Dar es Salaam for business can do so without incurring the added cost of an overnight stay. The person can fly out at 7:45 a.m., landing in Dar es Salaam at 9 a.m., then return to Nairobi at 9:15 p.m. on the same day. It also connects to the main flights into and out of Nairobi\u2019s JKIA airport, allowing travelers to connect quickly,\u201d added Eng. Matindi.</p>\n\n<p>Apart from Nairobi, Air Tanzania has announced three new regional routes this month from Dar es Salaam to Bujumbura (Burundi), Ndola (Zambia), and Lubumbashi (DR Congo) as the country seeks to expand passenger services to new markets in Africa, Asia, and Europe as international borders reopen and travel restrictions ease. Mumbai (India), Hahaya (Comoros), Lusaka (Zambia), Harare (Zimbabwe), Entebbe (Uganda), and Guangzhou (China) are among the destinations served by Air Tanzania. It will add Johannesburg (South Africa), Lagos (Nigeria), Accra (Ghana), and London (United Kingdom) to its destinations in the coming months.</p>\n\n<p>Air Tanzania Company Limited (ATCL) presently has eleven new modernized aircraft in its fleet, with eight of them joining in the last three years including five\u00a0Bombardiers Q400\u2019s, four\u00a0Airbus A220-300\u2019s, and two\u00a0Boeing 787-800 Dreamliners.

To act contrary is to act against the aspirations of the people aspired for a government based on the essential values of human rights, equality, freedom, democracy, social justice and the rule of law.\u201d</p>\n\n<p>He has also asked the Commissioner General of Prisons to confirm whether Kinoti is in their custody.</p>\n\n</article>", "canonicalUrl": "https://www.kahawatungu.com/itumbi-wants-dci-denied-funding-kinotis-firearms-bodyguards-withdrawn/"},{"url": "https://www.kahawatungu.com/kenyas-covid-19-positivity-rate-at-1-1-as-32-contract-virus/", "probability": 0.99828196, "headline": "Kenya\u2019s Covid-19 Positivity Rate at 1.1% as 32 Contract Virus", "datePublished": "2021-12-06T15:11:09+03:00", "datePublishedRaw": "2021-12-06T15:11:09+03:00", "dateModified": "2021-12-06T15:20:38", "dateModifiedRaw": "2021-12-06T15:20:38", "author": "Mercy Auma", "authorsList": ["Mercy Auma"], "inLanguage": "en", "breadcrumbs": [{"name": "You are here:"}, {"name": "Home", "link": "https://www.kahawatungu.com/"}, {"name": "HEALTH", "link": "https://www.kahawatungu.com/category/health/"}, {"name": "Kenya\u2019s Covid-19 Positivity Rate at 1.1% as 32 Contract Virus"}], "mainImage": "https://i2.wp.com/www.kahawatungu.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/test-1.jpg?fit=1160%2C652&ssl=1", "description": "Kenya's Covid-19 positivity is now at 1.1% with the cumulative tests so far conducted now at 2,858,654.32 people have contracted Covid-19 in the last 24 hours after a sample size of 2,893 was test", "articleBody": "Kenya\u2019s Covid-19 positivity is now at 1.1% with the cumulative tests so far conducted now at 2,858,654.\n\n32 people have contracted Covid-19 in the last 24 hours after a sample size of 2,893 was tested.

She feels the party ought to have supported her ambitions for the Kirinyaga governor seat since she was among the founding members of the \u2018Hustler Nation\u2019 party.</p>\n\n<p>Ngirici says she regrets spending millions to support the new party\u2019s activities.</p>\n\n<p>\u201cOnly tricksters exist in the world of politics, loyalty is a mirage and ambiguous. I don\u2019t even want to remember how much I have used to build the UDA party in Kirinyaga from scratch, but I\u2019m young in politics and still learning,\u201d she told <em>The Standard</em> in an interview on Thursday.</p>\n\n<p>She claims her commitment to the party made her\u00a0convert her \u2018Ngirici and Sons Rescue Team\u2019 offices to UDA county offices.</p>\n\n<p>Ngirici says she changed the branding of the centre\u2019s vehicles, from ambulances and service utility vehicles to UDA colours to support the party and Ruto\u2019s presidential campaigns.</p>\n\n<p>The latest development, she says, has changed her view of President Uhuru Kenyatta\u2019s handshake with ODM leader Raila Odinga.</p>\n\n<p>She told the publication that she is no longer bitter with the Head of State for his decision to work with the opposition leader.</p>\n\n<p>\u201cThe president only got a new friend who was his political arch-rival. The move calmed the country and the protests became a thing of the past. I am now no longer bitter about the move since Waiguru\u2019s defection opened my eyes,\u201d Ngirici said.</p>\n\n<p>She is, however, yet to announce if she will be joining the handshake team ahead of the 2022 polls.</p>\n\n<p>\u201cI\u2019m, however, confident that my supporters will follow me, regardless the pedestal I\u2019d be standing on.
