A comparison of previous data revealed that the population doubled from 3.7 million to 8.3 million between 2013 and 2017.\n\nDespite this population growth and the expected increase in purchasing power, the country\u2019s retail sector is still majorly supported by the informal retail sector, similar to most of Sub-saharan Africa.\n\nCopia\u2019s mobile commerce provides the needed convenient access to formal retail shopping for the middle- to low-income population in the country.\n\nThe timing is fortunate for Ugandans given the vast need for Copia\u2019s mobile commerce service, deemed an essential business that can continue to operate day and night despite the worsening COVID-19 pandemic.\n\nWith Copia, people can access all the goods they need to run their households while remaining safe and healthy, away from large towns and markets.\n\nA 2020 report by the United Nations Development Programme (UNDP) on the socio-economic impact of COVID-19 in Uganda shows a 50% decline in physical visits to retail stores and a 36% decline in visits to groceries and pharmacies due to restricted in-person business operations.\n\nWhile nearly 20 million Ugandans have mobile subscriptions (44% out of a total population of 47 million) only 12 million use the internet, which leaves a large gap in the number of people enabled for the digital economy.\n\nWhile Copia is a technology-enabled company through and through, it does not require customers to be tech-savvy.\n\nThe system is flexible to allow people to order anything they need through whatever medium best suits them, whether it be a phone call, text message, app or through a local agent.\n\n\u201cUganda has one of the fastest-growing middle classes in the world with a hard-working population and a dynamic entrepreneurial culture. Copia is designed specifically to serve this high growth but underserved consumer base who want access to high-quality products at the best prices,\u201d Copia Global Founder and Chair Tracey Turner said.\n\n\u201cHarnessing mobile technologies, a network of local agents and logistics technology, Copia can transform middle class and emerging middle-class Africans into empowered global customers. Our expansion into Uganda is the next step in fulfilling that mission,\u201d she added.\n\nEstablished in 2013, Copia\u2019s model leverages a network of digitally-enabled, locally based agents who operate as order and delivery points to meet consumers where they are, online or offline.\n\nCopia agents are existing trusted shopkeepers like a local grocer or butcher, where customers can select and pay for products chosen from a Copia catalogue.\n\nAfter the order is placed, Copia sends an SMS order confirmation to both the agent and the customer and in 2 days, Copia delivers the products to the agent for customer pick up. Through the creation of its agent network, Copia supports the resilience of thousands of small and medium enterprises in Uganda.\n\n\u201cWe are mindful of the challenges facing consumers in remote areas and we aim to be part of the solution to connect them to quality and affordable products. Over the last seven years, we have completed more than five million deliveries and served more than one million customers in Kenya and we are eager to expand our success story to the Uganda market,\u201d Tim Steel, Copia Global Chief Executive Officer, said.\n\nOver the coming years, Copia plans to expand its mobile commerce platform and logistics network across other regions of Africa.", "articleBodyHtml": "<article>\n\n<p>Copia Global, a fast-growing mobile commerce platform built to serve middle to low-income African consumers, has expanded operations to Uganda.</p>\n\n<p>Copia Uganda is built on the company\u2019s success in its\ninitial market, Kenya where Copia serves more than 1 million customers and is\ndoubling in size every year.</p>\n\n<p>The expansion will bring high-quality and affordable\nproducts to millions of middle-class Ugandans, regardless of location,\ntechnology access or connection status.</p>\n\n<p>According to a 2016/17 study by the Economic Policy Research\nCentre, Uganda has experienced an upsurge of the middle class.

The content can be anything from suggestive semi-nude photos to full on lewd photos. The site has been referenced in many songs such as Savage, a song by Beyonce and Megan Thee Stallion. Many Americans have bought new houses and cars from running only fans accounts, where followers pay extra to view naked photos and tip the content creators for content created.\n\nSKULLS\n\nThere is a market for both human and animal skulls online. A clean and embellished human skull can fetch up to Sh85,000 on eBay. The online market also deals with human and animal bones with some collectors buying human skulls from different eras and years in order to diversify their collections. There are currently no laws to govern the sale of human and animal bones, as the trade is still very new.\n\nCLINICAL STUDIES\n\nBeing part of clinical studies is a quick way of making money. If you fit the clinical studies\u2019 specifications, you can negotiate for a good payment depending on the time period of the study and the anticipated side effects. One should get into this only when they are fully aware of all the side effects of the drug on trial.\n\nFEET MONEY\n\nWhile you may think your feet should just be used for walking, they can also earn you good money. You can sell photos of your feet on specific websites and on Instagram as well. All you have to do is post pictures of your feet with the right hashtags. Some people even buy photos of your feet in socks or shoes and may also buy the worn socks and shoes, of course at an extra cost.\n\nEGGS\n\nWhile someone may not be able to sell semen in Kenya today, it is very possible to sell eggs.

of sex pills at the devolution event.", "articleBody": "It has now emerged that Embu County pitched a tent to sell sex-enhancing drugs at the just concluded 7th Annual Devolution Conference in Makueni County.\n\nEmbu took advantage of the phrase \u2018sex sells\u2019 and opted to market the aphrodisiac \u2018Mukombero\u2019 popularly used in western Kenya as a libido booster.\n\nWhile other counties pitched tents at Makueni Boys High school to showcase innovative technologies that promoted technological advancement, Embu decided to be unique.\n\nBut interestingly, reports indicate that hundreds of delegates thronged the exhibition stand to purchase the pills.\n\nThe wonder sex pill is the brainchild of Dr Pattedy Nyaga; a pharmacist based in Embu. Dr. Nyaga said there was an overwhelming demand for the sex-enhancing pill, adding that the Ksh1,900 packs containing 50 capsules had sold out, prompting restocking all the way from Embu.\n\nHe said that his innovation of making Mukombero tablets was an effort to conserve the plant that was nearly facing extinction. Dr. Nyaga pointed out that Mukombero has been overharvested and chewed raw for its properties of increasing sexual vigour and vitality in men.\n\n\u201cI innovated this drug because I feared it may become extinct,\u201d Nyaga told K24 Digital.\n\nAt the Embu County stand, there was also another sex drive improving drug named \u2018Viga\u2019. Dr. Nyaga confirmed that Viga has properties of increasing sexual virility and guaranteed his clients of an elevated sexual appetite after taking the capsules.\n\nViga is said to be the product of an Indian herb known as Ashwagandha, which is popularly used in Ayurveda; a pseudoscientific alternative medicine system with historical roots in the Indian subcontinent that has been practised for over 5,000 years.\n\nIt is not clear whether Embu County is now taking the course of promoting sexual tourism or why the County government has taken the path of officially promoting drugs that increase the sexual desires of its populace. Questions as to whether Embu men experience low libido also remain unanswered.\n\nEmbu county Director of Communication Robert Ndwiga defended the move saying the county is out to offer enabling environment for businessmen.\n\nHe asserted that as a result of the two sex-enhancing products, the county\u2019s tent attracted many Kenyans at the devolution event.\n\n\u201cThe government do not do business and our biggest task is to facilitate businessmen so that they can prosper in terms of giving them relevant infrastructure, trade promotion, technical advice and even to an extent of looking money for them so that they can do business, Robert told K24 Digital.\n\nHe added; \u201cEmbu tent in Makueni was overflowing with curious Kenyans who were buying products that we had.\u201d", "articleBodyHtml": "<article>\n\n<p>It has now emerged that Embu County pitched a tent to sell sex-enhancing drugs at the just concluded 7th Annual Devolution Conference in Makueni County.</p>\n\n<p>Embu took advantage of the phrase \u2018sex sells\u2019 and opted to\nmarket the aphrodisiac \u2018Mukombero\u2019 popularly used in western Kenya as a libido\nbooster.</p>\n\n<p>While other counties pitched tents at Makueni Boys High\nschool to showcase innovative technologies that promoted technological\nadvancement, Embu decided to be unique.</p>\n\n<p>But interestingly, reports indicate that hundreds of delegates thronged the exhibition stand to purchase the pills.</p>\n\n<p>The wonder sex pill is the brainchild of Dr Pattedy Nyaga; a\npharmacist based in Embu.
